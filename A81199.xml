         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER. TO Thoſe eſpecially of this CITIE, who yet continue to promote this WORKE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> (writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all the Saints) ſayd, <hi>This ſecond Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,</hi> ſo I may ſay (and have learned, I hope, to ſay it without boaſting or comparing) <hi>This ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Epiſtle Beloved) I now write unto you, in all which my deſire is to ſtirre up your pure minds by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, that ye may be mindfull of the words which were ſpoken, and of the troubles
<pb facs="tcp:153845:4"/> which were endured before, by this (Great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of ſuffering) Holy and patient Job.</hi> And though <hi>ſeven,</hi> being a perfect number, might hint me a fayre pretence to ſit downe and doe no more, yet I am further from thinking what I have done <hi>perfect,</hi> then I am from deſiſting (in reference to my owne intention) to perfect (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that meaſure of light which ſhall be given in) what is yet to doe. 'Tis A General mercy, that in an Age wherein the <hi>ſword</hi> hath been called out to doe and hath done <hi>ſo much,</hi> there hath been not only leyſure, but encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for <hi>The pen</hi> to doe <hi>this litle.</hi> And 'tis <hi>your ſpeciall honour,</hi> who ſtill promote this, or any worke of this kinde, that while ye have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in ſo great a charge for the maintaining of a Warre, and the preſerving of peace, ye have not excuſed your ſelves in this poynt of charge. And (poſſibly) it will be no diſhonour to this Age in future Ages, nor to This Nation in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Nations, to ſee or heare, that our ſpirits have neyther been hurried nor skarred by warres and changes into an indiſpoſition or incompoſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes for workes of ſuch ſeriouſnes and retirement. What <hi>Daniel</hi> prophecyed of the building of the Wall of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> whether literal or myſticall) is true of this <hi>Paper-wall</hi> (which is no ſtranger
<pb facs="tcp:153845:4"/> to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) it hath been built <hi>in Troublous Times.</hi> Eccept the Lord build both houſe and wall, they labour in vaine that build in calmeſt times; and where the Lord buildeth (though by weake and unskillfull hands) labour ſhall not be vaine in ſtormy times; it ſhall neyther be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in vaine, becauſe unfiniſht for uſe; nor ſhall it be labour in vaine, becauſe unvſefull when 'tis finiſht. The bleſſing of God (and without that nothing can) delivereth all our honeſt labours from theſe two vanities, and his bounty delivereth them from a Third. For while we are ſtedfaſt and unmoveable, alwayes aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the worke of the Lord, as we may have a ſtrong confidence that our labour ſhall not be in vaine to others, ſo a full aſſurance that it ſhall not be in vaine to our ſelves. Plaine-hearted <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> labouring in the integrity of his ſoule for <hi>Laban,</hi> onely in keeping ſheepe, though his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges (as envying that he thrived ſo faſt) was changed ten times, yet he thrived the faſter, and he <hi>who came over Jordan with his ſtaffe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came two bands. To be ſure we can never want eyther pay or reward for that worke which is a reward and can pay it ſelfe.</hi> And though, I know (and cannot but thankefully acknowledge Honored Sirs) that this long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb facs="tcp:153845:5"/> worke hath been an occaſion of Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble expence to you; yet I much beleeve that it will not prove any thing of loſſe to any of you. <hi>There is</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) that ſcattereth and yet increaſeth, and there is that withholdeth more then is meete and it tendeth to poverty.</hi> They that ſcatter to doe good, ſow what they ſcatter; and that which is ſowne in a right ſoyle increaſeth to a harveſt. They that withhold what they have, more then is meete, ſhall not hold what they have, but meete with poverty. As that which is given in charity, for the releife of the poore, ſo that which is given in a due tempered liberality for the uſe of the publicke, is lent to the Lord, and he will ſurely repay all that he hath borrowed. <hi>Therefore give a porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſeven and alſo to eight</hi> (whether indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent perſons, or pious uſes) <hi>for ye know not what evill ſhall be upon the earth.</hi> If evill come upon the earth, they will be found the beſt huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands of their goods, who have layd up moſt in heaven; and if good continue upon the earth, they will not finde any miſſe of what is ſo layd up. I write this, not as eyther fearing an abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my owne private intereſt, nor as hoping or looking after an increaſe of it: but only as a gratefull teſtimony of what ye have freely done
<pb facs="tcp:153845:5"/> for the carrying on of this worke, and as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that in ſo doing ye have not done eyther unwiſely or unprofitably for your ſelves.</p>
            <p>As for this peice of the worke now given in to your hands, and publiſhed to the view of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I ſhall only ſay, That herein ye have an end of the Controverſall or diſputative part of this Booke. <hi>Jobs</hi> friends have now finiſht their laſt reply upon him, and <hi>Job</hi> hath finiſht his laſt anſwer to them. For though he continueth ſpeaking five whole Chapters longer, yet he ſpeaketh, rather to the generall ſtate of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, then to any of their particular objections, as may appeare hereafter (if God give leave) in the Explication of that large and patheticall diſcourſe. And it was well, that his Opponents would make an End ſomewhere, and leave what they had offered to the judgement of equall and indifferent moderators. Which may be a just rebuke upon many in this Age, who will diſpute and draw the ſaw of contention ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly; as if they thought it a diſhonour, when they have ſayd all, to ſay no more, or were reſolved never to be ſatisfyed, how much or how often ſo ever they have been anſwered. <hi>Moderate and modeſt diſputing tends to heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but the itch of diſputing</hi> (which an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
<pb facs="tcp:153845:6"/> and learned Knight, deceaſed, would have engraven upon his Tombe-ſtone) <hi>leaves nothing but a ſcabby ſoarenes upon the minds of men, and doth rather widen differences then compoſe them. Abner</hi> (eyther grieved or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed with the tedious protraction of a civill warre) <hi>called to</hi> Joab (Captaine Generall of <hi>Davids</hi> Army) <hi>ſhall the ſword devoure for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver? knoweſt thou not, that it will be bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the end, how long ſhall it be ere thou bid the people returne from following their brethren?</hi> We have but too much cauſe to call and cry upon ſome <hi>Leaders in the Scholaſticall Warre, Shall your tongues and pens devoure for ever? know ye not that it is unpleaſant to many in the way, and is like to be bitternes to more in the end? When will ye returne from following your Brethren? Eliphaz, Bildad,</hi> and <hi>Zophar</hi> followed their Brother <hi>Job</hi> long, but they gave it over at laſt, and returned from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him. Though, I confeſſe, there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of <hi>contending,</hi> and that (as the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> exhorts) <hi>earneſtly,</hi> both by ſpeech and pen, <hi>for the faith once delivered to the Saints;</hi> Yet there are many contentions, which it had been well if they had never been begun, or at leaſt quickly ended. And when men revile and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
<pb facs="tcp:153845:6"/> rather then argue, It is beſt to take up that Counſel which good <hi>Hezekiah</hi> gave in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement concerning <hi>Rayling Rabſakeh, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them not. Solomon</hi> hath given us the full ſtate of this duty in a ſeeming contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, while in one verſe he forbids us to anſwer a Foole, and in the next bids us anſwer him. <hi>The foole muſt be anſwered according to his folly,</hi> but the anſwer muſt be framed and drawne up by the ſtrength of reaſon and wiſedome; that is, the foole muſt be made to ſee his folly, leſt he grow up and be confirmed in his opinion, that what he ſaith is true, becauſe he is not ſhewed the error of it; yet, <hi>The foole muſt not be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered according to his folly,</hi> that is, if he ſpeake or write vainely and revilingly, ſhewing rather the frothynes of his wit, or the over-flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his gall, then the ſobriety and ſoundneſſe of his Judgement, he that anſwers him muſt not conforme eyther ſpeech or ſtile to his, <hi>leſt he be like unto him;</hi> The anſwer which we give to another, beareth the image and is the meaſure of our ſelver; And our ill-mannaging of a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter renders us as bad as others, though our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be better. <hi>Our Maſter Chriſt being reviled reviled not againe,</hi> we his Diſciples and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers ought to imitate him, and <hi>not to render
<pb facs="tcp:153845:7"/> evill for evill, or rayling for rayling, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe to bleſſe.</hi> While we are called to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, let us doe it fayrely and candidly; Chriſt would have us ſhew love and tendernes to our brethren, as wel as zeale for Him and his Truth. They cannot but doe ſo, who ſtand up for truth purely as 'tis the truth of Chriſt, rather then as it is their owne opinion. And (though I am loath to be ſuſpitious, yet) I greatly ſuſpect, that the reaſon why many caſt ſo much dirt and diſhonour upon the perſons of their Brethren, while they appeare as Champions for the Truth, proceeds from a ſecret deſire to procure honour to their owne perſons rather then the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Truth. Peace and truth are a bleſſed payre, and were we more for peace we ſhould ſooner find out the truth; But ſo long as men contend rather for a party or an opinion then for truth, rather for victory and the Maſtery then for truth, rather for honour (I had almoſt ſayd humour) and intereſt then for truth, as we are ſure not to meete with peace, ſo we are extreame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hindred and puzzl'd in ſeeking out the truth. The most probable way to keepe downe ſome <hi>ill-ſented opinions,</hi> is to lay downe all diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them; eſpecially, now, when moſt if not all Controverſies on foote, have been ſifted to the
<pb facs="tcp:153845:7"/> branne. What therefore remaines but that we waite for light and conviction from heaven, looking how the holy Spirit of truth and peace, will ſtate and determine thoſe poynts upon the conſciences of men; And I am fully ſatisfyed that if all would ſuffer their conſciences to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer and reply rather then their conceits and parts, moſt of our diſputers in this age would (like <hi>Jobs</hi> friends) diſpute no more. O That we could a while leave arguing with and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering one another (eſpecially rayling upon and ſcoffing at one another) and fall to praying for &amp; loving one another, according to the utmoſt ted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Goſpel-love. For as love is the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or fullfilling of the whole Law of God, the ſcope or intentional end of the Commandement, ſo it would be the concluſion or finiſhing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining end of all the Controverſies which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe or are ſtarted among men. And I conceave that (in moſt poynts of difference) <hi>a ſevere and Magiſteriall impoſing of an opinion upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in way of diſpute, is as bad and as un Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-like, as to impoſe it upon any by way of power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beloved and Honored Friends, ye may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave how farre my joy, for being arrived at the end of this diſpute between <hi>Job</hi> and his friends,
<pb facs="tcp:153845:8"/> hath tranſported me to preſſe for at leaſt an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable carrying onne, if not an end of all our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes; and that (as the Apoſtle adviſeth) <hi>ſpeaking the truth</hi> (and for the truth or <hi>Truth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it) in love, we may grow up into him in all things, which is the head even Chriſt; From whom the whole body fitly joyned together and compacted by that which every joynt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth, according to the effectuall working of every part, maketh encreaſe of the body to the edifying of it ſelfe in love.</hi> Love is a knitting, and therefore an increaſing grace. That which u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteth many in one, muſt needs <hi>edifie That One,</hi> which is the reſult of ſuch a union. As faith is that Grace by which we receave all from God, ſo love is that Grace by which we conveigh and divide good among our ſelves. There is not the leaſt joynt in the myſticall body of Christ, but gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth ſome ſupply to the whole, becauſe love is the ligament of it. As we can want nothing while (as the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> exhorts) we <hi>keepe our ſelves in the love of God,</hi> (whether we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand him of the love of God to us, or of our love to God, makes no difference as to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) ſo we can hardly want any thing, while we keepe our ſelves in the love of one another. That all who love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in ſincerity,
<pb facs="tcp:153845:8"/> may, by the preſence and influence of the Spirit of love, not only keepe themſelves, but increaſe in the love of God, and in the love of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till we are fully growne up in him in all things, which is the head even Chriſt, is the wiſh and prayer, as it ought to be the endeavour of all and of him who would</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>LIPHAZ</hi> now enters his third and laſt conteſt with <hi>Job;</hi> in which ſome tell us that he behaveth himſelfe like a man who ſeekes Victory rather then Truth: who though he hath been ſufficiently anſwered, yet will not ſeem to be overcome; yea that he takes up the ſame weapons to maintain this third, with which hee maintain'd his two former Encounters; The firſt in the fourth and fifth <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> and the ſecond in the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. as if he were reſolved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:153845:10"/> though he could not confute the reaſons wherewith <hi>Job</hi> had made his defence.</p>
                  <p>But as ſuch a carriage as this in Diſputation is altogether vaine in it ſelfe, ſo it is moſt uncomely in a wiſe and godly man; who ought not to refuſe truth and reaſon though ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by an Adverſary, but rather modeſtly to ſit downe and confeſſe his own errour and miſtaking: And therefore though <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in this anſwer or triplication doth but roule the ſame ſtone, and move upon the ſame hinge in generall; ſtill adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Job</hi> to ſuffer for his ſinne, and to be puniſht as an evill do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; yet he puts all into a new method, and varies the ſceane or manner of his argumentation, which may be reduced to this forme; as if <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had ſaid: <hi>O</hi> Job! <hi>if thou ſuffereſt all theſe evills for ſome cauſe (as certainely thou doſt, for theſe things could not come by chance, but by the wiſe diſpoſure and providence of God) then that cauſe or reaſon for which thou ſuffereſt, muſt either be found in God or in thy ſelfe: If thou ſayeſt the reaſon is in God, and that he doth it by his prerogative, thou doſt raſhly intrude thy ſelfe into his ſecrets, and art over-bold or curious in ſearching into his hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den counſells; and when thou haſt made out thy conjectures, we may as eaſily denie as thou doſt affirm: but if thou haſt recourſe to, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This ſeems to be the ſumme of that whole diſcourſe which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> gives in this Chapter, as will further appear in the explication of the parts.</p>
                  <p>Againe we may contract his ſcope and give it in this briefe; Job <hi>having conſtantly affirmed againſt his friends, that God equally afflicts the righteous and the wicked: and having ſaid (which might have gained reſpect to what he was about to ſay) that hee pleaded for God</hi> (Chap. 21.4. <hi>As for me, is my complaint to man, or for man, no, it is to God, or in Gods behalf.) Hereupon</hi> Eliphaz <hi>taxes him with this preſumption, as if he would needs undertake to be a patron for God, and ſo to bring him in ſome advantage, or to ſtand him in ſtead, for the maintaining of his cauſe; therefore he begins his ſpeech with this chiding expoſtulation; Can man be profitable unto God? or (ſuppoſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:153845:10"/> thou wert (which I ſhall preſently diſprove) as thou haſt often boaſted, righteous, yet) is it any pleaſure to the Almighty that thou art righteous?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſeems to be the intent of the whole Chapter, in which we may further take notice of two diſtinct parts. The firſt is reprehenſory, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> reproves and rebukes <hi>Job</hi> ſorely, to the end of the 20. verſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is hortatory; <hi>Eliphaz</hi> moveth <hi>Job</hi> earneſtly to repentance, in which he coucheth many Promiſes, and gives Aſſurance that it ſhall not be in vaine, from the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

                     </note> to <hi>Teach;</hi> The Chaldee Paraphraſe favours this tranſlation, and ſome render it ſo in both parts of the verſe; <hi>Can a man teach God, As he that is wiſe may teach himſelfe?</hi> If a man ſhould be ſo bold to take upon him to teach God, would God regard his teachings? but I ſhall paſſe by this alſo, eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had no reaſon to tax <hi>Job</hi> with ſuch a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, as if he had taken upon him to direct God how to order his affaires; when as <hi>Job</hi> himſelfe (<hi>Chap.</hi> 21. <hi>v.</hi> 22.) had ſtrongly repreſſed and condemned ſuch a boldneſſe. <hi>Shall any teach God knowledge? Job</hi> having ſo lately exalted God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mans teaching (as was ſhewed in opening that verſe) it is not probable that <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſhould reprove him, as conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe wiſe enough to teach God: Or that he thought <hi>Job</hi> either had done, or was about to doe that which with his laſt breath almoſt, he confeſſed no man could do.</p>
                  <p>The third is our reading, <hi>Can a man be profitable unto God?</hi> Can a man? he doth not mean an ordinary weak, ſickly, frail man; but a man, yea any man at his beſt: the word here uſed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:153845:11"/> notes a man in his health, ſtrength, and glory; a man in the flower and perfection not only of his naturall abilities, but in the richeſt furniture and array of his acquired, yea inſpired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities. Take this man, a man of theſe atttainments, a man thus accompliſht, and <hi>Can he be profitable to God?</hi> For as when the Pſalmiſt ſaith (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.17.) <hi>A horſe is a vaine thing to ſave a man;</hi> By the horſe there, wee are not to underſtand a leane, poor, weak, ſlow-pac'd horſe, or a ſtrong, ſwift horſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man'd; Such a horſe indeed is a very vain thing to ſave a man by; Such a horſe may do a man more hurt then help when hee comes into danger; but the Pſalmiſt means a horſe of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſtrength, courage, and ſwiftneſſe: A horſe exactly man'd, and taught all his poſtures, even ſuch a <hi>horſe is a vaine thing to ſave a man.</hi> Againe, when the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Chriſt came to ſave ſinners,</hi> we muſt not underſtand it of leſſer, lower, or of the ordinary ſort of ſinners only, but even of the higheſt and the greateſt, for ſuch Jeſus Chriſt came to ſave as well as the leaſt of ſinners. So here when 'tis ſaid, <hi>Can a man be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to God?</hi> we muſt expound it of the higheſt, of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt, of the holieſt, of the beſt of men; <hi>Can a man be profitable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God?</hi> The word is <hi>El, The ſtrong God;</hi> Can the ſtrongeſt man be profitable unto the ſtrong, the mighty, the omnipotent, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God? <hi>Can he be profitable?</hi> Can he bring any advantage, gaine, or profit to God? <hi>Should he reaſon with unprofitable talke</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eliphaz.</hi> Chap. 15.3.) or with words that bring in no Profit? A word of the ſame root, ſignifies a <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> who is a keeper of publique Profits (<hi>Eſay</hi> 22.15.) <hi>Goe, get thee unto this Treaſurer, even unto Shebna. Can a man be profitable?</hi> Thus <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liphaz</hi> reproves <hi>Job</hi> for inſiſting ſo often upon his own inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, as if that were an Advantage to God? As if he had ſaid, how holy or righteous ſoever any man is, the Lord receives no advantage by him. So that <hi>Eliphaz</hi> (it ſeems) apprehended <hi>Job</hi> truſting or boaſting of ſomewhat in himſelfe, as if he had thought God his debtor, or that hee had done ſomewhat for which God was beholding to him. And upon this ground, that God is debtor, or beholding to no man; <hi>Eliphaz</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes <hi>Job:</hi> And though his ſuppoſition was falſe, yet his poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was true, and gives us this profitable obſervation,
<q>That the beſt of men cannot oblige God, or merit any thing at his hand.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:153845:11"/>
                  <p>That which is our duty to doe, cannot merit when we have done it. We cannot oblige either God or man by perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming our owne obligation. Thus Chriſt argues, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.7. <hi>Which of you having a ſervant ploughing or feeding Cattell, will ſay unto him by and by when he is come from the field, goe and ſit downe to meate? And will not ſay unto him, make ready wherewith I may ſup, and gird thy ſelfe, and ſerve me, till I have eaten and drunken, and afterward thou ſhalt eate and drinke. Doth he thanke that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant becauſe he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not. So likewiſe yee, when yee have done all theſe things which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you, ſay, wee are unprofitable ſervants, we have done that which was our duty to doe.</hi> Where Chriſt proves, that becauſe the ſervant had done no more then was his duty to doe, therefore he did not merit in doing it. <hi>When you have done all that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you, ſay yee are unprofitable ſervants.</hi> He that doth all thoſe things that are commanded him, is <hi>a man indeed, a man of worth, a man of men,</hi> yet (let that be granted that he reacheth to the utmoſt line of the Command) he is an unprofitable ſervant, he hath but done his duty.</p>
                  <p>There is another Parable in this Goſpel of <hi>Luke</hi> that ſeems to be ſomewhat oppoſite to this (<hi>Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 36, 37.) <hi>And ye your ſelves be like unto men that waite for their Lord when he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the wedding, that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open to him immediately. Bleſſed are thoſe ſervants, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>om when the Lord cometh, he ſhall finde ſo watching,</hi> that is, at their worke. Watching is not meant here of a bare waking, or not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, for a man may watch, in that ſenſe, and yet be as bad as a ſleeper: To be found awake, and yet idle, to be found awake yet doing nothing, is as blameable as to be found aſleep: So that to be found watching, is to be found intent upon, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring in the work of the Lord. <hi>Bleſſed be thoſe ſervants whom when their Lord cometh he ſhall find ſo watching</hi>) what wil he do? <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, that he ſhall gird himſelfe, and make them to ſit down to meate, and will come forth to ſerve them.</hi> In the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>Chap.</hi> Chriſt ſaith; If a ſervant have been hard at worke in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Lord, even as a man that is come from Plow, or from feeding his Cattell, yet his Maſter doth not ſay to him, ſit downe to meate, but firſt bids him gird him ſelf and ſerve him, and afterward goe to meat. But here 'tis ſaid, the Lord pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:153845:12"/> girds himſelf, and makes his ſervants ſit down to meat, and will come and ſerve them: ſo that here he ſpeaks, as if the Lord were much beholding to theſe ſervants, whereas before hee ſpeaks of them as unprofitable ſervants, to whom he was not at all beholding.</p>
                  <p>For the clearing of theſe two Parables, we are to diſtinguiſh them by their ſcopes. The ſcope of the Parable in the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>Chapter</hi> is to ſhew, that the diligent ſervant ſhall receive much from the hands of the Lord, or that the labour of the diligent ſervant ſhall not be in vaine, or unprofitable to him.</p>
                  <p>But the ſcope of the Parable in the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Cha. is to ſhew, that the moſt diligent ſervant cannot doe any thing that is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto his Lord. He may do that which may be profitable to himſelfe, but he can do nothing that can be profitable to his Lord, that's the ſcope of the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, which falls in fully with the Text, and Obſervation that I am now upon. There is a wide difference between theſe two parables. To ſhew what a diligent ſervant may expect, is one thing, and what the moſt diligent ſervant can challenge or require is another. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed thoſe ſervants in the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, to whom the Lord adminiſters the Supper, or to whom he miniſters at Supper, muſt ſay that they are unprofitable ſervants to the Lord; though they are to acknowledg (to the praiſe of their Lord) that his ſervice hath not been unprofitable unto them, and they muſt ſay ſo upon theſe Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt he is their Lord, they his ſervants, not their owne (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20.) <hi>Yee are bought with a price, yee are not your owne, therefore glorifie God in your bodies &amp; in your ſpirits which are Gods.</hi> God is the owner of our bodies and ſpirits, our ſelves are the Lords. Now if we our ſelves, our bodies, and our ſpirits are the Lords, then much more are our ſervices his. If the perſon be anothers, all the work done by him muſt be his too.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the houſe wherein theſe ſervants are feaſted is the Lords. The whole fabrick of heaven and earth is his houſe, He hath ſet it up to entertain and feaſt his people in.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, All the cheere and good things with which the Lord feaſteth his ſervants (all the comforts which grace holds out in this life, or glory in the next life) are of his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, the whole furniture of the Table is of his coſt and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:153845:12"/> charge, therefore they are obliged to their Lord, not their Lord to them; he is indeed profitable unto them, but they are not profitable unto him: They by their ſloath and idleneſſe might deſerve to be ſent ſupperleſſe and hungry to bed, but by all their pains and diligence they could not deſerve their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; <hi>Can a man be profitable unto God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve,
<q>That God is abſolutely Independent and Perfect in him ſelfe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If there be an impoſſibility that man ſhould be profitable unto God, then he is Self-ſufficient, and altogether Independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, in reference to man: He that cannot receive any addition is perfect in himſelfe, and he that is ſelf-ſufficient, needs not: to receive any addition from another, is an argument of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection. And ſeing God neither receives, nor can receive any thing from another, he muſt needs be perfect in himſelf. <hi>David (Pſal.</hi> 16.2.) ſpeaking of himſelfe (as the type of Chriſt) ſaith, <hi>O my ſoule, thou haſt ſaid unto the Lord, thou art my Lord</hi> (that is, thou art my Portion and my All) but <hi>my goodneſſe extendeth not to thee,</hi> I am not able to doe any good which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth to thy benefit, or encreaſeth thy happineſs, for thou art mine. In the 50<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>Pſalm</hi> the Lord aſſerts this his own indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency; <hi>If I were hungry, I would not tel thee, for the world is mine &amp; the fulneſſe thereof.</hi> If I had any hunger (that is, any defect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me) I need not go to the creature to aske a ſupply, I could ſupply my ſelfe if there were any need, but there's none: The Lord is infinitely above all hunger, above all wants and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects whatſoever. He indeed threatens Idolaters, that he <hi>will famiſh all their gods</hi> (Zeph. 2.11.) Idols ſhall be hungry, they ſhal be famiſht, and have none to adminiſter any thing to them. This the Lord doth, when hee with-draws their reſpect and worſhip, that name and reputation which once they had in the world from them; worſhip is the food of Idols, that keeps liveleſſe Idols (as it were) alive, and therefore falſ gods are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed, when their falſe worſhip is caſt downe; but who can famiſh the Lord? If I were hungry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I would not tell you; <hi>Can man be profitable unto God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it may be objected; Cannot a man be profitable to God? is man no advantage, no help to him? why then (<hi>Judg.</hi> 5.23.) Sings <hi>Deborah, Curſe ye Meroz, ſaid the Angel of the Lord,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:153845:13"/> curſe yee bitterly the inhabitants thereof, becauſe they came not to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord againſt the mighty.</hi> It ſhould ſeem then that the Lord had need of the help of theſe inhabitants of <hi>Meroz,</hi> and if they had come forth, it had been an advantage to him, why elſe were they curſed for not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming forth to the help of the Lord?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, man is ſaid to help the Lord, when he helps in the Lords cauſe. Perſonally the Lord needeth not my helpe, but the Lord may be helped relatively, in his Cauſe, and in his people. Thus we help the Lord, when we help man, when we help the Church, and people of God; It is our honour as well as our duty, to help his People, and give aſſiſtance in his Cauſe; This the Lord takes ſo well at our hands, that he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons it as help given to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if wee conſider the help as given to the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, we are not to conceive that the Lord needed the helpe of theſe men of <hi>Meroz,</hi> as if hee could not helpe them himſelfe without the aſſiſtance or ayd of man. For when he ſeeth <hi>that there is no man, then his owne arme brings ſalvation,</hi> Iſa. 59.16. 'Tis the duty of man to come forth and draw his ſword in the Lords quarrell againſt the mighty, but the Lord needeth not the ſword of man to ſubdue the mightieſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It may be objected; <hi>Cannot man be profitable unto God?</hi> he ſpeaks of the Church of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> in ſuch language as implies them a profit to him. <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5. <hi>Now if yee will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey my voyce indeed, and keep my Covenant, then ſhall ye be a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar treaſure unto me above all people.</hi> And is there no profit in a treaſure? Again, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.9. <hi>The Lords portion is his people, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob is the lot of his inheritance.</hi> Hath a man no profit by his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? no advantage by his Inheritance? Now if the Lords People be his Portion, his Inheritance, his Treaſure, his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſpecial treaſure, how then can it be ſaid, they are no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, no advantage to him?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, the Lords people are his treaſure, not becauſe they enrich him, but becauſe he hath a high eſteem of them. The Lords People are his treaſure, not becauſe they profit him, but becauſe he protects them: If I ſay to a man, you ſhal be a treaſure to me; I may do it, not becauſe I expect any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit from him, but becauſe I have a high eſteem of him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:153845:13"/> to protect and defend him as I do my own portion and treaſure; In this ſenſe doth the Lord ſay of his People, <hi>Yee are my treaſure.</hi> We eſteem treaſure, and treaſures are under pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, leſt any take them from us. Thus the Lord ſpeaks of his People, not that he hath any profit or gaine by them, as men who ordinarily have Portions and Inheritances in Fields or Houſes which are their ſtock and livelihood. Indeed there is a Revenue which the Lord hath by his People as they are his portion; that is, a Revenue of glory and honour, not a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of profit. But if you ſay glory and honour is profit, and an advantage to man, is it not then an advantage to God to be glorified by man?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, It is no advantage to God when he is glorified by man. Our glorifying of God doth not add any glory to him that he had not, but it is only the ſetting forth of that glory which he had; there is no encreaſe of his fullneſſe by all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory that the creature gives him. We are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to glorifie God. (<hi>Matth.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works and glorifie your Father which is in heaven.</hi>) But God doth not receive any additionall glory by us, how much or how clearly ſoever our light ſhineth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men. A candle adds more light to the Sun, then all the creatures in the world can adde to the glory of God, when they have ſtudied his glory, and laboured to glorifie him to the utmoſt all their dayes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that of <hi>David</hi> may be yet objected, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.3. <hi>The Lord hath ſet apart for himſelfe the man that is godly.</hi> And is ſo, then it ſeems he intends to make ſome profit of him; it is an alluſion unto thoſe that vend wares: A Merchant looks upon this and that commodity, and then ſaith this is for my turn, this I like, <hi>ſet it apart for me.</hi> Seeing then the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d ſets the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apart for himſelfe, it ſounds as if he meant to make ſome gaine or advantage by him.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, the meaning of that Scripture is not, that God ſets a godly man apart as one that he gets profit by, but as one that he intends to beſtow mercy upon; or he ſets him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for ſervice, not for gaine; The Lord ſerves his own ends by the ſervice of man every day, and ſets apart the godly man for his ſpeciall ſervice.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:153845:14"/>
                  <p>Yet a little further, I ſhall demonſtrate that a man cannot be profitable to God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God had all perfection before man was, therefore man cannot profit God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.2. <hi>From everlaſting, and to everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting thou art God,</hi> shat is, thou art infinite in glory and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency from everlaſting. God was God as much before there was a creature, as he hath been ever ſince the creatures were; therefore creatures adde nothing at all to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All the goodneſſe and profitableneſs of man comes from God, therefore no profit goes unto God from man: that's the Apoſtles argument, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.25. where he ſhews that man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not advantage God, no not by worſhip. <hi>He is not worſhipped with mens hands as though he needed any thing.</hi> What, doe you think God calleth for your worſhip, becauſe he needs your worſhip? or as if hee could not tell how to be without your worſhip? Nothing leſſe; <hi>Seeing he giveth to all life and breath &amp; all things.</hi> He that gives all things to all men, needs nothing of any man: heres the Apoſtles argument, the Lord giveth out all things, life, breath, and all comforts whatſoever to all men, therefore he needs nothing of any man, no not the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of any man. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. The Apoſtle aſſigns that reaſon againſt boaſting: <hi>What haſt thou that thou haſt not received, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then doſt thou boaſt?</hi> When do men boaſt? even when they think they have done God a good turn. <hi>What haſt thou that thou haſt not received? therefore why doſt thou boaſt as if thou hadſt not received it.</hi> What can he receive of us from whom we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our all? And <hi>though wee muſt returne all to him in a way of thankefulneſſe and duty, yet God needs not that we ſhould return any thing to him in a way of largeſſe or ſupply.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Take this demonſtration of it; they who live much in God, even they (upon the matter) need little or nothing of the creature; they (upon the matter) are Independent as to the creature who depend fully upon the Creator. The good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill of this world is not much to them, who are much with God. They have but little to do with the creature, and can do well enough without the creature. (<hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17.) <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the figtree ſhall not bloſſome, neither ſhall fruit be in the vines, the labour of the Olive ſhall faile, and the fields ſhall yeeld no meate; the flock ſhall be cut off from the fold, and there ſhall be no herd in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:153845:14"/> the ſtalls; yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation.</hi> As if he had ſaid, what if all creature comforts are taken away from me, I can live upon God alone. The life of a Believer is much above the creature, how much more is the life of the Creator? The Apoſtle (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10.) ſpeaking of himſelf, ſaith, <hi>as having nothing, &amp; yet poſſeſſing all things.</hi> If <hi>Paul</hi> by the high actings of his faith &amp; dependencies upon God could ſay he poſſeſſed all things, while he was as having nothing in the creature. Surely God hath all, when he hath nothing of or from the creature; He may ſay in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, <hi>having nothing (of theſe things) and yet poſſeſſing all things.</hi> Lay theſe two obſervations together.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That the Creature cannot oblige God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That God is Independent, abſolute, perfect without the creature,</hi> and the reſult of both will riſe up in theſe eight con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, this will follow, <hi>That we ſhould not murmure, nor be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented with our Eſtate</hi> whatſoever it is, why? we are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable unto God, we have deſerved nothing at his hand. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content ariſeth from pride, from an opinion that we are not anſwered according to our worth; we ſhould never be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, were we convinced that we are altogether worthleſſe. Do but ſit down in this thought that man cannot be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto God in any ſtate, and then be diſcontented with your ſtate if you can.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If the creature cannot be profitable unto God, Then, <hi>all that God doth for man, yea for Angells, proceedeth from his free grace.</hi> We give him nothing afore-hand, nor any thing afterward, therefore it is grace before, and grace after grace in all. We receive grace when we have no grace, and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive more grace when we have it; yet by the grace we have we do not deſerve to receive more; As we received the firſt grace, meerly of gracc, ſo we doe the ſecond. No man is aforehand with God; if any think they are, let them ſhew their Bills, what they have brought in, and it ſhall be acknowledged. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.35, 36. <hi>Who hath firſt given, and it ſhall be recompenſed to him again?</hi> For, <hi>of him, and through him, and to him are all things, to whom be glory for ever, Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If man cannot be profitable unto God, then as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:153845:15"/> none ſhould dare to come to God in their owne worthineſſe, ſo none ſhould feare to come to God becauſe of their unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs. We ſhould not be diſcouraged, though as yet dead and fruitleſs, though vain and unbelieving; The worſt of men ſhould not keep off from God, becauſe they are unprofitable, ſeing the beſt cannot profit him. <hi>If we have don much it is nothing to the Lord: and if we have done nothing, it is no barr to the Lords do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much for us.</hi> God will not turn us back becauſe we bring him nothing, nay he invites us to come without any thing (<hi>Eſay</hi> 55.1.) <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth come to the waters, buy, &amp;c.</hi> Here is buying, but for what? for profit? no, but <hi>come buy wine &amp; milk without money and without price.</hi> God doth not expect any profit; there is a kind of buying, but its not for money, nor for money worth. As the Lord ſometimes ſells his people, ſo he alwayes ſels his graces and comforts, <hi>for nought</hi> (Pſal. 44.12.) <hi>Thou ſelleſt thy people for nought, and doſt not encreaſe thy wealth by their price.</hi> That is, thou leaveſt thy people under miſeries and afflictions, by which it doth not appeare that thou getteſt any honour. Now as the Lord doth ſometimes ſell his people, ſo he alſo ſells his mercy and grace to his people (as to any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of theirs) <hi>for nought;</hi> hee ſells without money and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out price, therefore be not diſcourag'd if you have nothing of your own of any worth to preſent unto him. Say not, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhall we come before the Lord?</hi> The poorer you come in your owne thoughts, the richer you ſhall returne; For <hi>he filleth the hungry with good things, but the rich he ſendeth empty away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If man cannot be profitable unto God, then our gifts and parts, yea our holineſſe and graces do not make us neceſſary unto God. God may ſay unto the great Ones of the Earth, I have no need of you, and to the rich I have no need of you, and to the wiſe, I have no need of you; yea he may ſay unto the godly and to the holy, I have no need of you neither. There is no creature neceſſary to God, ſeeing he cannot only (as we ſay) live, but live in the heights of happineſſe without the Creature.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, <hi>If no man can be profitable unto God,</hi> then whatſoever God requires of us, he aims at our profit, and not at his own; all is for us, or for our good, which will appear more fully in the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:153845:15"/> opening the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>xt clauſe; <hi>He that is wiſe may he profitable to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> The Lord hath deſigned all our wiſdom and obedience to our own benefit: So <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake to the people of <hi>Iſrael (Deu.</hi> 6.24.) <hi>The Lord commanded us to doe all theſe ſtatutes, to feare the Lord our God for our good alwayes, that he might preſerve us alive, as it is at this day.</hi> It is not for the Lords good, but it is for our good that he commands, and we obey. And as the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all things in the Law for our good, not for his own: ſo he commands us to believe the Goſpel not for his good, but for our own; he is not to be ſaved by it, it is we that are to be ſaved by it. He doth not call us to work as men do their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that he might play the good husband, and get ſome profit by keeping us hard at labour. Indeed the Lord keepeth his ſervants hard at labour night and day, they muſt be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually upon duty: But he doth it not (as I may ſay) to play the good husband, to encreaſe his ſtock by it, but it is for our profit. That which Chriſt ſpeaks (<hi>Mar.</hi> 2.27.) about the Sabboth, is true of all other the commands of God, we are apt to think, that God requires a ſeaventh day, becauſe it is for his profit and advantage; no ſaith Chriſt, the Lord hath not an eye to himſelfe, but to man; <hi>The Sabboth was made for man;</hi> that is, for mans advantage, that he might look heaven ward, that he might worke in the things which concern his owne bleſſedneſſe, therefore hath the Lord appointed him a reſting day. <hi>The Sabboth was made for man, and not man for the Sabboth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixtly, Then our diſobedience cannot hurt God, our ſinn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> cannot diſadvantage him, impaire his bleſſedneſſe, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh his glory. As mans obedience is no profit, ſo his diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is no diſprofit to God. Sinners ſhall be puniſhed, as they who have wronged and diſhonoured God, they ſhall be dealt with as ſuch: But really, all the ſinnes of the world doe not bring any damage or diſadvantage to God; <hi>Elihu</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe to this point, in the 35. Chap. of this Book, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 7. <hi>If thou ſinneſt, what doſt thou againſt him?</hi> (Every ſin is againſt the mind of God, but no ſinn is againſt the happineſſe of God) <hi>or if thy tranſgreſſions be multiplyed, what doſt thou unto him?</hi> is God impair'd by it? Surely no, God doth not looſe a pinn from his ſleeve (as I may ſay) by all the ſinnes committed in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:153845:16"/> the world; He hath no dependance at all upon our obedience for his bleſſedneſs; our ſins cannot hurt him, as our obedience cannot help him, which <hi>Elihu</hi> ſhews in the next verſe; <hi>If thou be righteous, what giveſt thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, hence ſee the honour of God, that hath made ſo many creatures, and man eſpecially of whom himſelfe hath no need, that hath ſo many to ſerve him, and yet needs none of their ſervices. Give God this glory: Wee think thoſe men are very glorious and honouurable who have but as much of the creature as will ſerve thier turn; all creatures are the Lords, yet he is not neceſſitated to ſerve his turn by any of them.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, then, ſee what an obligation lyeth upon us conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to bleſſe God, to be thankfull to him, to walk humbly with him, who gives us ſo many profits, when as we doe not profit him at all. God prizeth that highly by which himſelf hath no benefit; hee prizes the actings of faith and holineſſe highly, but he hath no advantage by them: God gives us profit by theſe, though himſelfe be not profited, though he is not the better by any thing we do, yet we are the better; The Lord binds himſelf by promiſe, that the leaſt good we do in ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhall have a good reward; <hi>He that gives but a cup of cold water to a Diſciple in the name of a Diſciple, ſhall not loſe his reward.</hi> But if we give thouſands of Gold and Silver to poore Diſciples, what profit hath God by it? And yet though none of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit comes to his hand, yet he reckons it as if all were put into his hand. All the charity and compaſſion ſhewed to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Chriſt taketh to himſelf (<hi>Matth.</hi> 25.) <hi>In that yee have done it unto theſe, ye have done it unto me.</hi> Chriſt had no need of alms, of viſiting or cloathing, yet he counts it as done to himſelfe, when we do it to any of his.</p>
                  <q>Can a man be profitable to God? as he that is wiſe may be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to himſelfe?</q>
                  <p>Some give the meaning of the words thus: Doth it follow, that a man can be profitable unto God, becauſe a wiſe man may be profitable to himſelfe? our reading reaches the ſame ſenſe. <hi>Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wiſe may be profitable to himſelf?</hi> It doth not follow, becauſe <hi>A man may
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:153845:16"/> profit another man, or profit himſelfe, that therefore he may profit God.</hi> That's the ſumme of the argument.<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, The wiſe man here intended is not the man that is politickly wiſe, worldly wiſe, carnally or craftily wiſe, but the man ſpiritually wiſe, his wiſedome will bring him in profit. He that is guided by holy and godly wiſedome, ſhall reap the benefit and eat the fruit of it. We have ſuch wiſdome

                  <p>But then it may be queſtioned, <hi>May a wiſe man be profitable to himſelfe?</hi> Doth not the Apoſtle ſay (<hi>Rom.</hi> 14.7.) <hi>None of us liveth to himſelfe,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt, the wiſe man muſt not make his own profit the end or the deſigne of his wiſedome, but he may look upon his own profit as that which will be the iſſue, frui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

(<hi>Prov.</hi> 9.12.) <hi>If thou be wiſe thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf,</hi> that is, the fruit or the good of thy wiſedome will drop into thy owne boſome. <hi>A wiſe man may look for his advantage in the end of his worke, though he is not to make his own advantage the end of his work.</hi> We are not to make either temporal or eternal advantages, the end of our wiſedome; but we may look upon them as fruits and effects that God leads us to by the exerciſe of wiſedome.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:153845:17"/>
                  <p>Secondly, I anſwer, a wiſe man cannot be profitable to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as the founder of his own happineſſe, or as having a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in himſelfe to make himſelf happy; but a wiſe man may be a means or an inſtrument of his owne happineſſe; and walking in the way of wiſedome, he walks in the way to his own happineſſe. Thus he that is godly wiſe, or that feareth God, may be profitable to himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve,
<q>He that is truly wiſe, godly and holy, ſhall find fruit and benefit by it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8.) aſſureth us that <hi>Godlineſſe is profitable for all things.</hi> The greateſt gain in the world is God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, <hi>It hath the promiſes of this life and of that which is to come.</hi> Whatſoever drops out of any promiſe of the Goſpel, fals into the lap of a goly man; the promiſes are his, and therefore the good of the promiſe is his. When the promiſes open at any time, and give forth their vertue, they muſt needs give it forth to him that is wiſe, to him that is godly, for godlineſſe hath the promiſes. When the Apoſtle had rebuk'd a ſort of men that made godlineſſe onely a ſtalking-horſ to get gain, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently adds, <hi>But Godlineſſe is great gaine, if a man be content with what he hath.</hi> Godlineſſe it ſelfe is great gaine, if we have no more, but godlineſſe brings in gaine, abundance of gaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it ſelfe. (<hi>Matth.</hi> 6.35.) <hi>Seeke firſt the Kingdome of God, and the righteouſneſſe thereof, and all theſe things ſhall be added</hi> (or caſt in as an advantage) <hi>to you.</hi> The Apoſtle (<hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21.) puts a kind of holy ſcorne upon ſinners, come, tell me, <hi>What fruit had you of thoſe things whereof you are now aſhamed?</hi> What fruit have you by your folly, pride, worldlineſſe, envy, what fruit have you found in theſe things? Bring me in an account of your gaine by trading in any ſin. <hi>The end of theſe things is death;</hi> there is no great profit in that. <hi>But now being made free from ſin, and become ſervants to God, ye have your fruit unto holineſs, and the end everlaſting life.</hi> Here are fruits good ſtore, and all good fruits both for here and hereafter. We can never want fruit our ſelves, while we are bringing forth fruit unto God: All obedience is attended with a bleſſing, and though as was toucht before, we cannot be the founders of our own bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, nor muſt we meerly deſigne our own happineſſe, or aime

                     </gap>.) We then make the beſt of our riches, when we lay up for our ſelves a good foundation.

                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, we do it by the right improvement of riches (for he ſpeaks there to rich men) not that we can lay any foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to build upon beſide Jeſus Chriſt, for other foundation can no man lay then that which is laid, even <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> but when our hearts are not glued to the creature, but we uſe them in a holy manner, here's our laying up a good founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

And further, a beleever may looke upon his worldly profits as a fruit of the ſame grace, the Lord having promiſed that he will bleſſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for him, ſo that every way a wiſe man may be profitable to himſelfe.

                     </gap>7.) And becauſe the Church is cloathed with this righteouſneſſe, therefore ſhe is called <hi>The Lords delight, (Iſai.</hi> 62.4.) <hi>Thou ſhalt no more be called forſaken, neither ſhall thy Land any more be termed deſolate, but thou ſhalt be called Heph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zibah, &amp; thy land Beulah, for the Lord delighteth in thee.</hi> Thou ſhalt be called <hi>my delight, or my pleaſure is in her.</hi> The word of the Text, the Lords pleaſure is in the Church, and therefore the Lords pleaſure is in the Church, becauſ the Church is adorned and beautified with the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt; this is

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>God takes pleaſure alſo in us as we are righteous in Converſation. David</hi> (Pſal. 147.10, 11.) gives a clear proof of it both in the negative and in the affirmative. <hi>The Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth not in the ſtrength of a Horſe, he taketh not pleaſure in the leggs of a man.</hi> The Lords delight is neither in Horſes nor in men, neither in their ſtrength, nor in their beauty: wherein is the Lords pleaſure then? The next words ſhew us where, <hi>He takes pleaſure in them that feare him and hope in his mercy.</hi> This Scripture ſeems to ſpeak directly contrary to <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in <hi>Job,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Is it any pleaſure to the Almighty that thou art righteous?</hi> But <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Lord takes pleaſure in thoſe that feare him;</hi> therefore we muſt not underſtand <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in this ſenſe, as if the Lord had no delight or contentment at all in the holineſſe of his people, as if it were all one to him whether they are holy or unholy: There is a Generation who ſay, that all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are alike, and that it is all one before God, whether men be righteous or unrighteous, whether they doe good or evil: wo to them that underſtand this Scripture in ſuch a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſenſe, for the Lord doth not onely hate iniquity, but he is <hi>Of purer eyes then to behold any iniquity.</hi> He hath no pleaſure either in unrighteouſneſſe, or in the unrighteous, but both righteouſneſſe and the righteous are his pleaſure. There are three things which I ſhall touch for the confirmation of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Lord cannot but take pleaſure in his own Image: Now that righteouſneſſe which is implanted in us, and put forth by us, the righteouſneſſe of our natures and of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as we are regenerate, is nothing elſe but the Image of God renewed upon us. Seeing then God cannot but take pleaſure in his own Image, therefore it is a wickedneſſe to think that God takes no pleaſure in a righteous man or in his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as this righteouſneſſe is the image of God in us, ſo it is the very workmanſhip of God upon us (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.10.)

                     <hi>For we are his workmanſhip;</hi> we are ſo not only firſt in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall capacity, as we are men, and ſecondly in our civil ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity as ſuch or ſuch men, high or low, rich or poor, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo (which is the thing intended by the Apoſtle) in our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual capacity as Saints. Thus we are <hi>the workmanſhip of God, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, which God hath before or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that we ſhould walk in them.</hi> The ſame Apoſtle ſaith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>He that hath wrought us for this ſelfe ſame thing is God,</hi> (2 Cor. 5.5.) Is it poſſible that God ſhould have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in his own works? We read in the firſt of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that when he had made the world, the Lord <hi>ſaw all that he had made, and behold it was very good.</hi> God hath an All-ſeeing eye, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes beholdeth all things, but when 'tis ſaid, he ſaw all that he had made, this imports a ſpecial act of God, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men, who ſtrictly view and behold what they have done, delighting in it; Thus the Lord ſaw all that he had made, he (as it were) came to view his own work, he ſaw and behold it was very good, he took pleaſure in it. Now if God took pleaſure in that ſtructure and fabrick of the world, the firſt Creation, how much more doth he take pleaſure in that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe which he hath wrought in the hearts of his people, which is a ſecond creation? and that's a more curious and noble ſtructure then this viſible world is. <hi>The new Creation is more excellent then the old.</hi> Therfore the Lord cannot but delight in a righteous perſon for he is his workmanſhip. What <hi>Job (Ch.</hi> 14.15.) aſsures himſelfe of, is moſt true in this reſpect. <hi>Thou wilt have a deſire to the worke of thine hands. Job</hi> ſpeaks there of his outward man: my body (he means) was made by thee, 'tis the work of thy hands and thou wilt fetch it back again, thou wilt redeem it from the duſt. Whatſoever hath the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of God upon it, he hath pleaſure in it as it is his work, and a ſpeciall pleaſure in that, which (as any work of Grace is) is his ſpeciall work.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this Conſideration ſhews that the Lord muſt take pleaſure in a righteous perſon, becauſe he bears the form of his will revealed in his word. Holineſſe is our conformity to the will of God: Now the Lord cannot but take pleaſure in thoſe who conforme to his will. <hi>Samuel</hi> tels <hi>Saul</hi> (1 Sam. 15.22. and there he uſeth this word in the Text) <hi>Hath the Lord
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:153845:21"/> as great delight in Burnt-offrings and ſacrifices, as in obeying the voyce of the Lord?</hi> God gave thee a word, a Command, to which he expected thy conformity, but thou haſt thought to pleaſe the Lord with Sacrifices, which he commanded thee not, this was thy miſtake and thy folly. We honour God when we do his will, ſurely then he muſt needs take pleaſure in thoſe that doe it. Man takes pleaſure when he can have his will (though it be a corrupt and ſinfull will) fulfilled: It cannot but be a pleaſure to God when his holy will is fulfilled, or done on earth as it is in Heaven. Thus we ſee the ſecond Propnſition cleared, for the underſtanding of theſe words, That as the Lord takes pleaſure in thoſe who are righteous by the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted righteouſneſſe of his Son, ſo even in thoſe alſo who are reghteous by the Implanted righteouſneſſe or holineſſe of his ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>God takes pleaſure to ſee a ſincere and upright perſon juſtifie himſelfe, or plead his owne juſtice againſt all the falſe accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſuſpitions of men.</hi> The Lord likes it well to hear a man who is falſly accuſed, to ſtand up and maintaine his own innocency, yea it is our duty, and we are bound in conſcience to maintain our own innocency. So <hi>David</hi> in the ſeventh Pſalm and in the eighteenth Pſalm juſtified himſelfe againſt <hi>Saul.</hi> And thus <hi>Job</hi> all along in this Book juſtified himſelfe againſt the opinion of his friends; in this ſenſe God takes pleaſure, when we are ſo righteous in all our dealings, and perfect in all our wayes, that we dare encounter whoſoever ſpeaks the contrary, and can waſh off all the aſperſions which either miſguided and miſtaken friends, or profeſſed Enemies caſt upon us. You have now had thoſe three affirmative Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions for the underſtanding of the Text. Take three more in the Negative.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>God hath no pleaſure to ſee us juſtifie our ſelves before him, or to plead our own righteouſneſſe with him, yea he is extreamly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at it.</hi> This ſome conceive the chief thing which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> aimed at. <hi>Is it any pleaſure to the Almighty that thou doeſt juſtifie thy ſelfe?</hi> No, thou doſt highly provoke him in doing ſo, to plead with or to juſtifie our ſelves before God that we are righteous, is worſe then all our unrighteouſneſſe, for this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowes the whole deſign of the Goſpel, which is (1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:153845:21"/> 1.29.) <hi>That no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence, but be that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, let him glory in the Lord.</hi> And (<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19, 20.) The Law convinceth all, <hi>That all the world may become guilty before God, therefore by the deeds of the Law there ſhall be no fleſh juſtified in his ſight.</hi> God will have every mouth ſtopped, or cry guilty, and therefore for any one to open his mouth and juſtifie himſelfe before God, is to overthrow the Goſpel. They are <hi>ignorant of the righteouſneſſe of God, who goe about to eſtabliſh their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe</hi> (Rom. 10.3.) And as God hath no pleaſure in them who boaſt of their righteouſneſſe to juſtifie themſelves before him, ſo</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>God hath no pleaſure in them who boaſt of their owne righteouſneſſe, and contemne others.</hi> Though a man may aſſert the righteouſneſſe of his Converſation againſt all them who que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion it; yet God reſents it highly when any proclaim their own righteouſneſſe to the deſpiſing of others. Chriſt ſpeaks a Parable againſt thoſe (in the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Luke,</hi> v. 9, 10, 11.) who <hi>truſted in themſelves that they were righteous, and deſpiſed others. Two men went up into the Temple to pray, the one a Phariſee, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Publican: The Phariſee ſtood and prayed thus with himſelfe, God I thank thee that I am not as other men are, extortioners, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, unjuſt, or even as this Publican.</hi> Here was one that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his owne active righteouſneſſe, and he did it with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of another, <hi>I am not as this Publican.</hi> The Lord takes no pleaſure in this, yea the Lord is highly diſpleaſed with this. And (<hi>Iſa</hi> 65.5.) the Prophet repreſents the Lords indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt this phariſaicall ſpirit in dreadful eloquence, <hi>Stand by thy ſelfe, come not near to me, for I am holier then thou.</hi> Thus they pleaded their righteouſnes in contempt of others. <hi>Theſe</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>are a ſmoak in my noſe</hi> (that is, gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, and diſpleaſing) <hi>a fire that burneth all the day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>God hath no pleaſure at all in any of our righteouſneſſe, either in the righteouſneſſe of our Juſtification, or the righteouſneſſe of our Sanctification, as the leaſt addition to his owne happineſs.</hi> The reaſon of it is, becauſe (as was ſhewed from the former Verſe) God is ſelf-ſufficient, and hath no dependance at all upon the Creature: So that what pleaſure ſoever the Lord hath in the righteouſneſſe of our Juſtification, or of our Sanctification, we cannot put it to this account, that we add any thing to his happines.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:153845:22"/>All the pleaſure which God taketh is in himſelfe, or in the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his owne good pleaſure in Chriſt.</q>
                  <p>And therefore the work which Jeſus was to doe on Earth, is called <hi>the pleaſure of God</hi> (Iſa. 53.10.<note place="margin">Deus nullis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus quae extra ipſum ſunt tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitur aut mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatur.</note>) <hi>It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he hath put him to grief, when thou ſhalt make his ſoule an offering for ſin, he ſhall ſee his ſeed, he ſhall prolong his dayes, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand.</hi> That pleaſure of the Lord was the work which the Lord put into his hand, or which he gave him to doe, even the bringing about his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal purpoſe, for the recovery of loſt man; that's a work in which the Lord takes pleaſure, ſo much pleaſure, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet calleth it <hi>His pleaſure.</hi> And thus the Apoſtle ſpeaks (<hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5, 6.) <hi>Having predeſtinated us to the adoption of Children, by Jeſus Chriſt, according to the good pleaſure of his owne will,</hi> &amp;c. The good pleaſure of God is onely in his owne will, that's his pleaſure. The Lord delights to ſee his will accompliſht in the ſaving of ſinners, as well as in the obedience of Saints, that's a part of the good will of God: why doth he take pleaſure in the obedience of Saints, even becauſe his own will is done. It's not any thing in us that doth it. So when he ſaves us, the pleaſure which he takes is in the fulfilling of his owne will, rather then in our ſalvation. <hi>Is it any pleaſure to the Almighty that thou art righteous?</hi>

                     </note> and then it implyeth a Fear which God himſelfe might be thought to have of him; as if <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had ſaid, <hi>God is not afraid of thee.</hi> The Prophet ſaith (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.12.) <hi>Who art thou that thou ſhouldeſt be afraid of a man,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Quis vel hoc deſipiens ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, quod Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus ex timore nos arguat &amp; ex metu judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ſuum contra nos proponat. <hi>Greg.</hi>

Thus as the Lord is conceived ſaying in the Pſalm, I will not judge or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare thee righteous for thy Sacrifices, ſo here <hi>Eliphaz, will he</hi> (that is certainly he will not) <hi>judge or declare thee righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for thy feare?</hi> And ſo the latter part of the Verſe may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſame Expoſition, <hi>Will he enter with thee into judgment,</hi> namely <hi>for thy feare?</hi> Will God deale with thee upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of thy piety?

Or when God enters into judgement with thee, will he ſuffer thee to preſent thy fear, thy piety, or goodneſſe to him, and ſo thereby anſwer his plea, or take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the action which he brings againſt thee? When God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with us into judgement, we may boldly plead our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt or Faith in the Mediator, but we muſt not plead our fear, the Grace or Holineſſe either of our perſons, or of our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:153845:24"/> and merit of our works as to righteouſneſſe, is nul'd and laid proſtrate, and we taught to glory in nothing but the free gift and grace of God by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As <hi>Fear</hi> is taken paſſively, <hi>Will he reprove thee for feare of thee?</hi> That is, is God afraid of thee, doth he pick quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels with thee for fear of thee? Or ſeek occaſions againſt thee when there is none? only leſt thou ſhouldeſt ſtand in his way, or be a detriment to him. This appears plainly to be the ſenſe of our Tranſlators.</p>
                  <p>Whence Obſerve,
<q>God is above the feare of the Creature.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As in the former Verſe God is above any advantages or hopes that the Creature can give him, ſo he is above the feare of any hurt that the creature can doe him. As the goodneſſe or righteouſneſſe of man cannot benefit the Lord, ſo the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe and ſinfulneſſe of man cannot at all impaire the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glory and happineſſe of the Lord. Though the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of man be a darkening to the manifeſtations of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (and for that wicked men ſhall be judged) yet as to his eſſential glory all the wickedneſſe in the world cannot dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that, nor be the leaſt abatement to it. <hi>Will he reprove thee for feare of thee?</hi> No, man cannot hurt the Lord by all his wickedneſſe, and therefore</p>
                  <p>The puniſhment which God layeth upon wicked men is not after the manner of men. God doth not puniſh as man pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eliphaz</hi> here ſpeaks of that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is often indeed a true ground among men why they reprove or puniſh other men. Some reprove others upon a vaine fear of them, and ſome upon a juſt fear of them. Why did the <hi>Jews</hi> accuſe and reprove Chriſt? Was it not for fear of him? at leaſt they pretended a fear, why elſe were they ſo haſty to have Jeſus Chriſt brought to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? (<hi>John</hi> 12.47, 48.) <hi>Then gathered the chief Prieſts and Phariſees a Councel, and ſaid, what doe we? for this man doth many Miracles, if we let him thus alone, all men will beleeve on him, and the Romanes ſhall come and take away both our place and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> They Crucified Chriſt for fear (though it was but a vain fear) that he would be the ruine of their ſtate; the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> muſt needs come and deſtroy them if they let him alone.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:153845:24"/> 
                     <hi>Feare makes men cruell,</hi> and they are moſt ready to hurt others, who continually ſuſpect hurt from others. It hath been an ancient Obſervation, that <hi>Cowards are murtherous and revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;</hi> while a man fears that ſuch a man will be his ruine, he ruines him if he can, and removes that out of his way which he ſuppoſeth ſtanding in the way of his owne ſafety. Why did <hi>Pharaoh</hi> give Command to ſlay the Male-Children of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and oppreſſe that people? It was upon a vaine or cowardly fear, <hi>Come let us deale wiſely with them, leſt they multiply, and it come to paſſe that when there falleth out any warre, they joyne alſo with our enemyes, and fight againſt us, and ſo get them up out of the Land,</hi> (Ex. 1.10) It is ſayd at the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of that Chap. that <hi>the children of Iſrael were fruitfull and</hi> (God fullfilling herein his promiſe made to <hi>Abraham) encreaſed aboundantly, and multiplyed and waxed exceeding mighty, and the Land was filled with them.</hi> When God thus caſt a gratious eye upon them, <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi> and his Councellers caſt a jelous eye upon them; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſuſpect their multiplying might at laſt diminiſh him, that their riſing might prove his ruine. Therefore upon <hi>reaſon of ſtate</hi> he muſt find out a way to ſuppreſs and keepe them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as ſlaves and bondmen, whom his Anceſtors received as welcom gueſts, and had to that day, enjoyed as faithful friends. <hi>Pharoah</hi> being captivated with this feare, ſaw no way to free himſelfe, but by taking away the freedome of that whole Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. As ſome through the prevalency of their owne feares dare not doe juſtice, ſo others through the prevalency of feare doe that which is unjuſt. Take one inſtance more, why did <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod (Matth.</hi> 2.) ſend out to ſlay all the Children? It was for fear of the King of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> he was afraid of Chriſt, and therefore that he might murther him, he gave that horrible ſentence to ſlay all the Infants. Again, ſome reprove and judge upon a due fear, for as Tirants and wicked men are full of fear becauſe full of cruelty, and have ſuſpitious thoughts that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will wrong them, becauſe they have a mind to wrong every man: ſo juſt and righteous Magiſtrates when they ſee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil working, they muſt reprove and puniſh it leſt it ſpread to the endangering of the publick Peace. This is a juſt fear, and ſuch as becomes a man, even a man of courage and integrity;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:153845:25"/> ſuch may feare that if ſeditious ſpirits be let alone,<note place="margin">Veriſſimum eſt illud, quod in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter argumenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum aſſumit <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liphaz,</hi> ex ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more frequenter naſci aut vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentius accen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di ſolere ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem in irro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gando ſupplicio <hi>Pined.</hi>
                     </note> they will undermine a whole Nation, and deſtroy thouſands. A Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate reproves and Judges Theeves and Murtherers out of fear that if they encreaſe no man ſhall live quietly. Such as either openly or ſecretly contrive evil againſt a Nation, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate from a juſt ground of fear deals with them &amp; reproves leaſt they ſhould diſturb or infect the whole.</p>
                  <p>But the Lord doth not reprove any man for fear of him, he is of ſuch infinite ſtrength and ſtability, ſo far out of the reach of all the plots and contrivances of the wicked, that he needs not call them to account leſt they ſhould hurt his ſtate, pull him out of his Throne, ſpoile his Kingdome, or get his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion from him; the Lord is not afraid of any of theſe things, but the true reaſon why the Lord reproves wicked men, is, becauſe he hates their iniquities, and is a God of truth and judgment. Though Magiſtrates may puniſh not only out of the love of Righteouſneſſe and Judgment, but becauſe they fear a State may be ruin'd if they do it not, yet the Lord hath none of this fear, in regard of his State, but he doth it meerly out of love to juſtice, and as a hater of wickedneſſe.</p>
                  <p>He reproves man becauſe he hath ſinned againſt him, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is afraid of him, as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſhews in the words which follow.</p>

               <p>IN this Context <hi>Eliphaz</hi> intends to ſhew the true reaſon why God reproved <hi>Job,</hi> and entred into judgment with him; it was not (as was ſayd at the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Verſe) either becauſe God was afraid of him, or becauſe he feared God, but it was for his wickedneſſe, as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> (though miſtaken) concluded againſt him; as if he had ſaid, <hi>God doth not puniſh thee becauſe he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of thee, but becauſe he loveth juſtice, and hateth iniquity, Is not thy wickedneſſe great, and thine iniquity infinite?</hi> That's the ſcope of theſe words, which we may fitly call <hi>Job's Indictment,</hi> and this Indictment is laid down firſt in general words, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Is not thy wickedneſſe great, and thine iniquity infinite?</hi> And here <hi>Job</hi> is not charged with wickedneſſe and iniquity barely, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a two-fold aggravation.</p>

               </list>
               <p>Secondly, We have his Indictment drawn ont into particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Charges, or a ſpefication of ſome notorious ſins given againſt him in the Verſes following.</p>
               <p>This particular Charge conſiſts of two heads.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Sinnes againſt man; Secondly, Sinnes againſt God; His ſuppoſed ſinnes againſt man, contained in the words now read, are of two ſorts; Firſt, Sinnes of commiſſion, or of the evill which he had done; Secondly, Sinnes of omiſſion, or of the good that he had not done. The evill which he chargeth
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:153845:26"/> him to have done, is twofold; firſt, an act of injuſtice, <hi>taking a pledge,</hi> in the ſixt verſe; ſecondly, an act of uncharitableneſſe, <hi>ſtripping the naked,</hi> in the ſame verſe.</p>
               <p>Both which evills, or miſcarriages towards the honeſt poore are aggravated (<hi>ver.</hi> 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>) by his undue connivence at the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked rich; as he was too ſevere againſt the poore, ſo he was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-favourable towards the great, and mighty; <hi>But as for the mighty man he had the earth, and the honourable man be dwelt in it;</hi> as if he had ſaid; <hi>Thou didſt never ſet thy ſelfe to doe juſtice upon the great ones, be they and doe they what they will, they have the earth, thou didſt never put forth or exerciſe thy power to ſuppreſſe and oppoſe their inſolencies, thy edge was turned only againſt inferior ones; Thou tookeſt a pledge from the poore, and haſt ſtripped the naked of their cloathing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His ſinnes of omiſſion are expreſſed in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe; <hi>Thou haſt not given water to the weary, thou haſt withholden bread from the hungry;</hi> and in the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>Thou haſt ſent widdows away empty, and the armes of the fatherleſſe have been broken:</hi> Which may be either taken thus; Thou haſt broken their armes, or thou haſt not given thy helpe, and aſſiſtance to reſtore, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive them when broken. Thus we have a light into the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe five verſes, as they are a charge of ſinne upon <hi>Job.</hi>

                     <hi>Broughton</hi> renders; <hi>Doubtleſſe thy evill is great.</hi> Others conceive it more cleare to the minde of the Text, that this queſtion ſhould be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted conjecturally;<note place="margin">Non tam haec ei ex profeſſo obij<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, quam cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandum ei relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit, num haec fecerit. <hi>Merc.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Is not thy wickedneſſe great?</hi> That is, may we not ſuppoſe, that thy wickedneſſe is great? may we not from (at leaſt) probable grounds thinke thus of thee? And that, Firſt, from the generall ſtate of man by nature, mans heart being ſinfull he may ſinne, and ſinne (as it were) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bounds, greatly. <hi>There is no man</hi> (ſayth <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 Kings 8.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:153845:26"/> 46.) <hi>that liveth, and ſinneth not; Solomon</hi> puts it as a parenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis in his prayer, but it is ſuch a parentheſis, as hoocks in all man kinde, it takes all in, <hi>Who is there that ſinneth not?</hi> ſo (<hi>Pro.</hi> 20.9.) <hi>Who can ſay I am cleane from my ſinne?</hi> Now upon this generall ground <hi>Eliphaz</hi> might ſuppoſe, <hi>Is not thy wickedneſſe great?</hi> All men have this in their nature, and haſt not thou made improvement of it in thy life? All men being ſinfull by nature, art not thou extreamely ſinfull in practiſe?</p>
                  <p>Againe, He might make the ſuppoſition upon this ground, his preſent condition, or his affliction; thou art greatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, thy afflictions are not of an ordinary ſiſe, or meaſure, therefore is not thy wickedneſſe great? and thine iniquity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ordinary meaſure? Upon this common rule he might ſuppoſe his ſin very great; for uſually God doth proportion, and meaſure out puniſhments by our ſinnes. Thy ſufferings are very great, therefore are not thy ſinnes great too? Thus he might ſpeake conjecturally upon both theſe conſiderations; And yet if we conſider how poſitively he ſpeaks of particulars at the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſes, &amp;c: <hi>Thou haſt taken a pledge of thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for nought, and ſtripped the naked of their cloathing,</hi> &amp;c. He gives us but too much ground to thinke, that he did more then bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conjecture, while he ſayd;

                  <p>Againe, the word is rendred by others as ſignifying the evill of puniſhment in this part of the verſe, and not the evill of ſinne; <hi>Is not thy affliction great, therefore thy iniquity is infinite.</hi>

                     </note> The Greeke word (<hi>Matth.</hi> 6.34.) anſwers this, <hi>Sufficient to the day is the evill thereof,</hi> that is, the trouble, and the ſorrow of it: (<hi>Amos</hi> 3.6.) <hi>Is there any evill in the Citie which the Lord hath not done?</hi> So here, <hi>Is not thy evill great,</hi> thy evill of puniſhment? therefore thy iniquity is infinite. But I rather fix it upon the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:153845:27"/> former: though the word ſometimes ſignifies the evill of afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet here I ſhall take it for the evill of ſinne, or as we tranſlate, <hi>wickedneſſe,</hi> which denotes not ordinary but great ſinne; for though every wicked man be a ſinner, yet every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is not properly a wicked man.</p>
                  <p>Further, wickedneſſe in the former, and iniquity in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the verſe, may be thus diſtinguiſhed; <hi>wickedneſſe</hi> ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially reſpects thoſe acts by which we hurt, and wrong others, <hi>iniquitie,</hi> thoſe in which we paſſe by or neglect the duty which we owe to others;<note place="margin">Malitiam dicit plurimam, ſed iniquitates infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitas, quia in pluribus peccat homo omittendo quam commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendo. <hi>Aquin.</hi>
                     </note> and therefore <hi>Eliphaz</hi> calls his wickedneſſe <hi>great,</hi> but his iniquities <hi>infinite;</hi> becauſe ſinnes of omiſſion are more in number then ſinnes of commiſſion; Man fayles oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by not doing the good required, then by doing the evill forbidden. Nature can eaſier forbeare that which it likes, or pleaſeth it, then be converſant in that which it likes not, or with which it is diſpleaſed.</p>
                  <q>Is not thy wickedneſſe great?</q>
                  <p>The word ſignifies both magnitude and multitude, and it may be taken both wayes here, for great in bulke, and great in number.</p>
                  <p>But it may be ſaid, whoſe wickedneſſe is not great? or is any ſinne little? Why then doth <hi>Eliphaz</hi> faſten this upon <hi>Job, Is not thy wickedneſſe great?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, firſt, that it is unbecoming any man, to ſay his finnes are little; we ſhould not little, or leſſen our ſinnes, or have low thoughts of them; as wee ought not to have low thoughts of any of the mercies of God, but to thinke them all great to us, yea too great for us; ſo we ſhould not have light thoughts of any of our ſinnes, but judge the leaſt of them great, and the lighteſt of them heavy; yea even too great and too heavy for us to beare. Nor doth any thing more greaten a mans ſinne, then his opinion that it is little.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I anſwer, that indeed no ſinne is little; in the leaſt ſinne that ever was committed, there is a greatneſſe, as committed againſt the great God, as it is a breach of the Law, and an abuſe of the love of the Great God. Nevertheleſſe, though every ſinne, thus conſidered, is great, yet comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome ſinnes are but little, and ſinnes being weighed one
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:153845:27"/> with the other, we may give this diſtinction of them into lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and great, light and heavy. And as ſome Godly men are faithfull and feare God above many, ſo ſome wicked men are ſinfull and diſhonour God above many. <hi>Is not thy wickedneſſe great?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>'Tis our duty not onely to take notice of our ſinnes, but of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and degree of our ſinnes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eliphaz</hi> doth well to put <hi>Job</hi> upon that enquirie, <hi>Is not thy wickedneſſe Great?</hi> Though he did ill ſo groundleſly to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, much more to conclude that it was ſo. When <hi>Moſes (Exod.</hi> 32.31.) interceded for the people, after they had made the golden Calfe, he makes report of their ſin to God in the fulleſt aggravation of it; <hi>O, this people have ſinned a great ſinne, and have made them Gods of Gold;</hi> he doth not onely confeſſe in their behalfe, that they had ſinned, but they had ſinned great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>They have</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>ſinned a ſin,</hi> that's more then to doe a thing that is ſinfull, and which is yet more, They have <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a great ſin,</hi> and which is moſt of all, <hi>they</hi> (though they have been taught and have profeſſed that God made them) <hi>have made them gods of Gold. David</hi> makes this the ground why he did beg pardon of his ſin (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.11.) <hi>Pardon mine iniquitie for it is great.</hi> As we are to looke upon the greatneſſe of ſinne, to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſoules with godly ſorrow, ſo we are to looke upon the greatneſſe of ſinne when wee ſue to the Lord for pardon; pardon my ſinne for it is great; our very ſencibleneſſe that our ſinne is great, is a prevayling argument with God to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it; and our inſencibleneſſe that our ſinnes are great, gives the greateſt ſtop to the pardon of them. And as every ſinne hath the more need of pardon, by how much the greater it is, ſo God will have the more glory in pardoning it, by how much the greater it is. The great wounds, and ſickneſſes of the Patient have the more need of curing, and if a Phycitian cure a great wound, or ſickneſſe, he hath the more honour by the cure. Now that we may take the trueſt meaſure of our ſinnes, we muſt looke upon them, firſt in their nature and kinde, of what ſort they are, and to what they relate in their commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; ſecondly, in their circumſtances, when, how, and in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:153845:28"/> what manner they have been committed. That ſinne which is but little in the nature of it, may be a very great one in the circumſtances of it. As there are ſome mercies which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from God, little in their kinde, yet great in their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and very obligeing; ſo are our ſinnes. Some finnes are very horrid in their owne nature, they lay the conſcience waſt, and eate out the very principles of Godlineſſe, ſuch are Atheiſme, Blaſphemy, and Idolatry. The ſinne of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in making Gods of Gold, how deteſtable was it? a golden God, what an ugly ſight is that? and indeed there are many ſinnes which by how much they have the more externall beauty and glory upon them, the more ugly and filthy they are. Other ſinnes are ſmall in their kinde, yet by additionall conſiderations they ſwell into an immenſe vaſtneſſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come out of meaſure finfull.</p>
                  <p>For Inſtance, firſt to ſinne againſt light, that is, not onely to commit a knowne ſinne, but to commit it knowingly. (Tis poſſible, that while we know ſuch a thing to be a ſinne, yet to doe it unknowingly, or not to know that we have done it; He that knoweth it is a ſinne to tell any untruth, may yet tell one and not know it: But) when we doe that which is a knowne ſin, and likewiſe know that we doe it, then we have no cloake for our ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To ſinne againſt many received mercies, greatens it exceedingly; Thus the Lord aggravates the ſinne of <hi>David,</hi> I have done thus, and thus, for thee, and if this had been to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, I would moreover have given thee ſuch and ſuch things; <hi>Wherefore haſt thou deſpiſed the commandement of the Lord to doe evill in his ſight,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.8, 9.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It greatens ſinne when continued in after warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and renewed admonitions; <hi>He that being often reproved hardneth his necke, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,</hi> (Prov. 29.1.) The Greatneſſe of his puniſhment, (he ſhall be (not afflicted, but) <hi>deſtroyed</hi>) the quicknes of it (he ſhall <hi>ſuddenly be deſtroyed</hi>) the irrecoverablenes of it (and that without remedy) all theſe with one conſent vote the greatnes of that ſin, whatſoever it be in its kinde, which is perſiſted in after perſwaſion to deſiſt and depart from it. The Church is commanded to paſſe her extreameſt cenſure upon
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:153845:28"/> that offending brother, who having been told his fault; firſt, by that brother alone whom he hath offended; ſecondly, by him and two more aſſociated as witneſſes; thirdly, then, by the Church gathered in the name of Chriſt. (<hi>Matth.</hi> 18.16, 17.) <hi>But if be will not heare thee, then take one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witneſſes, every word may be eſtabliſhed: and if he ſhall neglect to heare them, tell it to the Church: but if he neglect to heare the Church, let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licane. It is dangerous enough to ſin againſt a rule, but tis more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to ſin againſt a reproofe; eſpecially againſt the reproofe of a whole Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, When we ſinne in the ſight of judgements upon our ſelves, or others, whether for the ſame, or other ſinnes: This is as if a theife ſhould ſteale before the Judge, or under the gibbet, while he ſeeth others arraigned or executed for ſtealing. It is very evill to ſin againſt judgements threatned, but it is far worſe to ſin againſt Judgements executed. That wrath which is revealed from heaven againſt all unrighteouſneſſe to the eare in the word of God, ſhould ſtop us from ſin, much more that which is revealed to the eye in the workes of God.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, When we ſinne againſt our owne promiſes not to ſinne, when our owne words condemne us, as well as the word of God, this ſtaynes every ſinne with a double guilt.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, The greatening of a ſinne is from the repeating of it after it hath been repented of. To fall into any ſinne out of which we have riſen, makes our fall the more grievous; when a ſinner lickes up his owne vomit, when he builds againe the things which he had deſtroyed, he makes himſelfe a tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor indeed. They who repent not cannot expect mercy, what remaines then for them but a certain fearefull expectation of Judgement, who repent of their repentings?</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Sin is greatly encreaſed when acted with deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration; to be hurried into a ſinne though great, is not ſo great as to doe a leſſe evill conſultively, or to adviſe upon it and doe it; ſome ſinne for want of advice, many ſinne againſt advice, and not a few ſin with advice, that is, adviſedly. <hi>Tis hard to finde out a way to give them comfort, who ſinne with counſell.</hi> They who are wiſe to doe evill, or who doe evill as a piece of their wiſdome (ſuch every deliberate action is eſteemed to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:153845:29"/> be) will be found the greateſt fooles. <hi>All ſin is folly, but thoſe ſins have moſt of the foole in them, which we thinke, we doe wiſely.</hi> In all theſe caſes, we may well ſay to any man, as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> here to <hi>Job; Is not thy wickedneſſe great?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>And thine iniquitie infinite.</q>

The Septuagint render it thus; <hi>Are not thy iniquities ſo many that they cannot be numbred? are they not innumerable?</hi> Another thus; <hi>Is not thy rebellion eternall?</hi> And ſo the ſence reacheth eyther the multiplication of acts, or the continuation of time. Our reading is comprehenſive of both; <hi>Is not thine iniquity infinite?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how could <hi>Eliphaz</hi> make ſuch a ſuppoſition as this? ſeeing there is nothing infinite but God, and it is altogether impoſſible that there ſhould be <hi>two infinites. The heavens cannot hold two Sunnes, much leſſe can the world hold two infinites.</hi> God is The onely Infinite; therefore ſinne is not infinite as God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite; Firſt, that is infinite which is without end; ſecondly, that is infinite which is without bound, in both God is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite; As he had no beginning, ſo he ſhall have no end or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of his being; He is infinite in reference to duration or time; and he is infinite in reference to place or extent; He fills heaven and earth; and the heaven of heavens cannot containe him. The Hebrew phraſe in the Text, <hi>without end,</hi> anſwers our tranſlation, <hi>infinite;</hi> for infinite is that which hath no bounds or end. So then in a ſtrict and proper ſence, there is nothing infinite but God. And infinity runneth through all the titles of God, he is infinite in power, infinite in wiſdome, juſtice, righteouſneſſe, and mercy; It remaines then to be further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, how we may underſtand this queſtion, <hi>Is not thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie infinite?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, ſin is not infinite properly, yet in a vulgar ſence, ſinne may be called infinite, for according to common accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we call that infinite which is very great, or which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all ordinary bounds, though not all bounds; onely that is properly infinite which exceeds all bounds, but we uſually
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:153845:29"/> ſay, that is infinite which exceeds ordinary bounds. Thus ſome mens ſins onely are infinite. For though every ſin be a break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the bounds which God hath ſet us, eyther in exceſſe or in defect; yet they who ſin after a common rate or proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinning, may be ſaid to keepe their bounds in ſinning. For what the Apoſtle ſpeakes of ſome tryalls and Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13.) the ſame may be ſaid of ſome ſinnes and tranſgreſſions, that <hi>they are common to man.</hi> But they who ſin (as the Prophet ſpeakes) with a high hand, or with both hands greedily, they who draw iniquitie with coards of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and ſin as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> were with cart-ropes, theſe doe not onely breake the everlaſting bounds of the Law, but the ordinary bounds of ſin. Their ſins are not common (in the act, though the principle be) to man; They ſin as few men ever ſinned, they ſin like devills rather then like men, and therefore (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this notion) their ſin is deſervedly called infinite.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may ſay, that ſin hath an infiniteneſſe in it in reference to the object, God, and ſo not onely a great ſin, and many ſins, but ſmall ſinnes, or any one ſinne may be ſaid to have an infiniteneſſe in it, becauſe it is committed againſt an infinite God. And hence it is that nothing can expiate ſinne but what hath an infiniteneſſe in it; the leaſt ſin, calls for the bloud of Chriſt to take it away, which bloud hath a kinde of infinity in it; for though the ſufferings and bloud of Chriſt were not properly infinite, becauſe they were the ſufferings of the humane nature, yet the divine nature ſhed forth an infinite worth and value upon his ſufferings; and therefore we are ſayd to be <hi>redeemed</hi> (or purchaſed) <hi>by the bloud of God</hi> (Act. 20.28.) that is, by the bloud of that perſon who is God, though the humane nature onely was capable of having bloud ſhed. Thus we may ſay, that the leaſt ſin, with reſpect to the object is infinite, God himſelfe being offended and wronged by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſin.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As this infiniteneſſe may be conſidered in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the extent of any one ſinne (that reaching as high as God) ſo to the number, or rather to the numberleſs of our ſins. There is an Arithmeticall as well as a Geometricall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity in ſin. Thus the Septuagint (as was ſayd before) ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Text; <hi>Are not thine iniquities innumerable?</hi> That hath a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:153845:30"/> kinde of infinity which cannot be numbred; but cannot our ſinnes be numbred? are they infinite in number?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, ſinnes may be conſidered two wayes: firſt, in their ſpecies and kinds; ſecondly, in their acts, if we conſider ſinnes in their ſpecies and kinds, ſo they are not innumerable, for it is poſſible to number up all the ſeverall heads, diviſions, and kinds of ſinne; but if we conſider ſin in reference to acts, ſo every mans ſins are innumerable; yet this innumerablenes of ſins in reference to acts, may be conſidered either abſolutely, or as to us. The acts of ſin, are not abſolutely or in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves innumerable, but as to us they are innumerable: they are more then any man can number. <hi>John</hi> ſayth, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 7.9.) <hi>After this I beheld, and lo a great multitude, which no man could number</hi> (beſides thoſe that were ſealed of every Tribe,) <hi>of all Nations, and kindreds,</hi> &amp;c.) This great multitude was not in it ſelfe without number, but as to mans arithmeticke it was, no man could number it. The haires of our head, and the ſands of the Sea, are numerable to God, but to us innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>David</hi> (Pſal. 40.12.) ſpeakes firſt of <hi>innumerable evills,</hi> and then of <hi>innumerable ſinnes; innumerable evills compaſſe me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, ſo that I am not able to looke up: they are more then the haires of my head, therefore my heart faileth me;</hi> when he ſayth, <hi>they are more then the haires of my head,</hi> his meaning is, they are innumerable; I can no more tell the ſumme of my ſinnes, then the ſumme of my hayres. Chriſt to aſſure his Diſciples in time of their afflictions and ſufferings, that he will take care of them, tells them; <hi>The very hayres of your head are all numbred,</hi> (Mat. 10.30.) As if he had ſayd, ſeing God taketh care of thoſe inconſiderable (not parts, but) excrements of the body, ſurely then he will take care of thoſe more noble parts of your bodies, and moſt of all of that moſt noble part of you, (which is your all) your ſoules. The hayres of our heads are innumerable to us, but God numbers them. The ſins of our hearts and lives are all numbred by God. <hi>Thou telleſt my wandrings,</hi> (ſayth holy <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 56.8.) he meanes it of his wandrings by perſecution, and 'tis as true of his wandrings by tranſgreſſion. But what man knowes the errors or wandrings eyther of his heart or life (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.12.) He that hath feweſt ſins, hath more then he can number; and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:153845:30"/> therefore every mans ſins are to him, in number infinite.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Iniquities may he called infinite in reference to the will, or the ſpirit of him that committeth thoſe iniquities: thoſe ſinnes are without bounds, to which man would never ſet a bound. The natural man would never end ſinning, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ſins are without end, or infinite. The Prophet (<hi>Jer.</hi> 13.27.) ſpeakes reproveingly to that people in the name of the Lord; <hi>I have ſeene thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdneſſe of thy whoredome, and thine abominations on the hills in the feilds; wo unto thee, O Jeruſalem, wilt thou not be made cleane, when ſhall it once be?</hi> As if be had ſaid; O <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> thou haſt no will to be made cleane, or thou wouldeſt never be cleane, if thou mighteſt have thy will; <hi>When ſhall it once be?</hi> The time is yet to come when thou wouldeſt have it to be ſo; thou haſt a mind to pollute thy ſelfe ſtill, but no minde to waſh thy ſelfe from thy pollution. The ſins of a perſon or people are then infinite, or without end, when they diſcover that they have no minde to leave ſinning. A godly mans deſires to doe good are infinite, and ſo are the deſires of a wicked man to doe evill. This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had ſpoken to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the ſame language (<hi>Chap.</hi> 4.14.) <hi>How long ſhall vaine thoughts lodge in thee?</hi> when wilt thou be weary of theſe lodgers, when wilt thou bid theſe gueſts be gone, whom thou haſt thus long bid welcome? The Church of God doth ſometimes ſuffer evill to lodge very long in her, even in the middeſt of her, as it were, at her very heart; but <hi>the world</hi> lodgeth <hi>or lieth</hi> (continually) <hi>in evill</hi> (1 Joh. 5.19.) and there (as it is the world) it will lie for ever, ſoakt and ſteept in evill. Some give this as one reaſon to juſtifie the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitneſſe or everlaſtingneſſe of the puniſhment that is laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on impenitent ſinners in hell. The damned are under endleſſe ſufferings, becauſe they would have ſinned without end;<note place="margin">Vellet ſine fine vivere ut poſſet ſine fine pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. <hi>Greg.</hi>
                     </note> A wicked man would live long, yea he would have no end of his life here, he would live ever, that he might ſinne ever; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord giveth him a life, not ſuch a one as he would have, but ſuch a one as he deſerves to have, which is indeed a death for ever. They dye eternally for ſin, who would have lived eternally in ſin. Take a Scripture or two more to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate this way of the infinity of mans ſinne, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 8.5.) <hi>Why is this people of Jeruſalem ſlidden back, by a perpetuall back-ſliding;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:153845:31"/> they hold faſt deceite, they refuſe to returne;</hi> Here are three phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes noting this one thing. Firſt, <hi>They hold faſt deceit;</hi> ſecondly, <hi>They refuſed to returne;</hi> thirdly, <hi>Their's was a perpetuall back-ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> or as ſome reade it, <hi>an eternall rebellion, an obſtinate rebellion, a ſtrong and mighty rebellion;</hi> the Seventy call it, <hi>an impudent ſhameleſſe rebellion:</hi> all theſe are proper Epithites of that obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, and ſetledneſſe of reſolution, which is in the heart of man by nature to continue in ſinne; yet there is a further ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the words, which as the Originall will beare, ſo it hath an elegancy in it, <hi>Why is this people of Jeruſalem ſlidden backe by a conquering, or a prevailing back-ſliding?</hi> A perpetuall back-ſliding hath conqueſt or triumph attributed to it upon a twofold conſideration; firſt, in reference to other ſinnes; finall obſtinacy, or impenitency lifts up its head above all other ſinnes, and ſits as King among them; impenitency un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any ſin committed, is greater then the ſin committed; not to repent of the evill we have done, is worſe then the evill which we doe. Impenitency ſeales the ſoule under condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Repentance conquers ſin, but impenitency is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering ſin. Secondly, 'tis called a triumphing or conquering ſinne, becauſe it ſeemes (as it were) to carry the day againſt the mercy and goodneſſe of God, that's a ſad conqueſt indeed; not that any ſinne, no nor impenitency for ſinne, exceeds the mercy and goodneſſe of God; for his thoughts of mercy are as high above our acts of ſin, as they are above our thoughts of his mercy, &amp; that is as high as the heaven is in compariſon of the earth. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.9.) But the mercy of the Lord is ſaid to be overcome by perpetuall backſlidings, becauſe the Lord will not be mercifull to ſuch; thus final impenitency may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a triumphing or conquering ſin, ſeing the mercy of God ſeemes to yeeld unto it; They will not humble themſelves to ſeeke mercy, yea they ſlight and deſpiſe mercy, therefore they ſhall not finde mercy. The Prophet <hi>Jeremie</hi> repreſents the LORD thus expoſtulating againe with the Jewiſh Nation (<hi>Chap.</hi> 5.22, 23.) <hi>Feare ye not me, ſayth the Lord, will yee not tremble at my preſence, which have placed the ſand for the bound of the Sea by a perpetuall decree that it cannot paſſe it, and though the waves thereof toſſe themſelves, yet can they not prevaile, and though they roare, yet can they not paſſe over it; but this people hath a revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:153845:31"/> and rebellious heart, they are revolted and gone.</hi> The words, as I conceive, have theſe two things in them; firſt, that the Lord is to be feared who doth ſuch things, who ſets bounds to the Sea, &amp;c. Secondly, that the wickedneſſe of mans heart is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, or rather that we are to be aſtoniſhed at the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe of mans heart, which is more boyſterous and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, then the raging waves of the Sea. The Lord ſets bounds to the waves of the Sea, which waves in their owne nature are altogether boundleſſe; liquid waves have no bounds of their owne, yet the Lord having put bounds to them, they are kept in bounds; <hi>The ſand bounds the Sea, ſo that though the waves thereof toſſe, they cannot prevaile, though they roare they cannot paſſe over; but this people have revolted, and are gone;</hi> As if he had ſaid, I the Lord have put a bound to the Sea, I have alſo ſet a bound to the wickedneſſe of mans heart; what is that? my Word, my Law. The Law of God is a moral bound to ſtop and keepe in compaſſe the raging waves of mans corruption. God doth not alwayes put an externall bound by ſword and judgement to ſtop men whether they will or no from ſinne, but he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes puts a morall bound to ſtop them; this is ſuppoſed in the Text, I put a bound to the Sea, to the Sea alſo of mans heart, to the wickedneſſe that is there, but this people are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted and gone, they have broken all my bounds, even that perpetuall decree of my righteous Law. Now as when the Sea breaks its bounds, the waters flow infinitely, there is no ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them; ſo when the heart of man breaks bounds, revolts and is gone, he ſinnes infinitely, he makes no end of ſinning. By theſe Scriptures we may underſtand in what ſenſe the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of wicked men may be ſayd to be infinite; though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is infinite in a ſtrict and proper ſence, but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                  <q>Is not thy wickedneſſe great, and thine iniquitie infinite?</q>
                  <p>But hath <hi>Job</hi> given <hi>Eliphaz</hi> any juſt occaſion of this ſurmiſe, that his ſin was in this ſence infinite? Did he ever obſerve ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wickedneſſe in generall, or thoſe particular wickedneſſes which he preſently enumerates, taking a pledge, denying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of the poore, ſtripping the naked, &amp;c? had he ſeene any of theſe evills acted by <hi>Job?</hi> certainly he had not; <hi>Job</hi> was a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:153845:32"/> man of another frame of life then theſe things import; theſe blacke lines and colours would never make the picture of <hi>Jobs</hi> heart or life; this is as ill a draught of a man as could be made; yet <hi>Eliphaz</hi> puts all this upon <hi>Job,</hi> at leaſt by ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; is it not thus? but what reaſon had he for this ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition? none but this, the greatneſſe of his affliction; the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite troubles that were upon him; God ſet no bounds to <hi>Jobs</hi> ſorrows, therefore he thought <hi>Job</hi> had ſinned beyond all bounds.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve;
<q>Wee are ready to judge their ſinnes great, who are the greateſt ſufferers.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though we know nothing by them, though we can charge nothing upon them, yet this thought riſeth naturally in us, when we ſee any under great and extraordinary ſufferings, ſurely they are great, and extraordinary ſinners. The worſt of ſinners never ſuffered more in this world, then the beſt of Saints; Witnes thoſe Jewiſh Worthyes, whoſe torments are reported by the Author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> (Chap. 11.37.) and as theſe were adjudged to ſuffer, becauſe they were thought the worſt of ſinners, ſo, doubtleſſe, many who ſaw them ſuffer thought them ſuch, though they knew nothing done by them to make them ſuch. Read alſo this Spirit (<hi>Luk.</hi> 13.2. <hi>Act.</hi> 28.4.) This hath been formerly obſerved from other paſſages in this booke, and therefore I onely touch it, and paſſe away.</p>
                  <p>Againe, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſeemes to take <hi>Job</hi> off from the wrong ground of his ſufferings, and tells him, though he looked to other reaſons, yet the true reaſon was the greatneſſe of his wickedneſſe, and the numberleſnes of his iniquities.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve;
<q>That few thinke of, or hitt upon any other cauſe of ſuffering but ſinne.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sin is ſo much and ſo often the cauſe of ſuffering, that we doe it no wrong to ſuſpect it as the cauſe of all ſufferings; and it is indeed one kinds of cauſe <hi>(cauſa ſine qua non)</hi> of all our ſufferings; ſo that we can hardly wrong ſin by this ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but we may eaſily wrong both God and man by it. When the blind man came before Chriſt, his Diſciples asked him, ſaying; <hi>Maſter, who did ſin, this man or his parents, that he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:153845:32"/> was borne blind;</hi> they could hit upon nothing but ſin, why the man was borne blind, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 9.2.) But at the third verſe, Chriſt anſwered, <hi>Neither hath this man ſinned, nor his parents;</hi> he vindicates both from this ſuſpition. What man was this? and who were his parents, that they ſinned not? were they cleane from ſinne? not ſo neyther, but the meaning of Chriſt is this, neither hath this man ſinned, nor his parents, ſo, as that eyther his ſin or theirs ſhould be reckoned the ſpeciall cauſe why he was borne blind. There was ſomewhat elſe in it, which the Diſciples tooke no notice of, nor did they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. Chriſt doth not deny but that a mans owne ſinne, and the ſin of his parents may be a cauſe of blindneſſe; but neither the one nor the other was the cauſe in that mans caſe; as if Chriſt had ſayd; Can you thinke of nothing elſe why a man is afflicted but onely his ſinne? There are many other cauſes of ſuffering beſides that. The cauſe why ſome ſuffer, is the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of their graces. The cauſe why many ſuffer, is to beare witneſſe to the truth, and to encourage others both in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of it, and in perſecutions for it. And Chriſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly aſſignes another cauſe of the ſufferings of the blind man, <hi>That the worke of God might be made manifeſt in him:</hi> That the worke of God in his power and mercy might be ſeene in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring this man to his fight, therefore was he borne without the power of ſeing. The blindnes of that man was an occaſion to make a very glorious diſcovery of God. Much of God had not been ſo eminently ſeene at that time, if that man had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſeene. Many are caſt downe upon beds of ſickneſſe, or into a ſtate of poverty, that the worke of God in rayſing them up to health and plenty may be made manifeſt. The deſigne of God lookes beyond the ſin of man in the afflictions of moſt men, yet man ſeldome lookes beyond it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note from the whole verſe;
<q>That we are more ready to judge the ſinnes of others great, then our owne.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Is not thy wickedneſſe great, and thine iniquities infinite? Eliphaz</hi> might have ſayd as much of himſelfe and his owne ſinne; and it had been but a duty to have done ſo; we ſhould not aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the ſins of others, nor extenuate or leſſen our owne, we
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:153845:33"/> ſhould not ſet the ſinnes of others in open light, nor provide coverings for our owne, yet moſt commonly we run the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary courſe: we have a favourable opinion, and excuſes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for what we have done, while we have hard thoughts of, and give harſh cenſures upon what others doe; our owne ſins we can call moats, and the ſins of others beames. The better any man is, the better he judges others, and the worſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake no complement, while he ſayd, that <hi>he was leſſe then the leaſt of all Saints, and the chiefe of ſinners;</hi> uſually they who are the ſevereſt obſervers and cenſurers of others, eyther flatter, or have not well obſerved themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly.</p>
                  <p>Foraſmuch as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſeing <hi>Job</hi> under great ſufferings, ſayth to him; <hi>Is not thy wickedneſſe great?</hi> The counſell in it ſelfe was ſeaſonable.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve;
<q>That in time of ſuffering, it is good both to put our ſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upon inquiry about our ſinnes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the Prophet (<hi>Lam.</hi> 3.39, 40.) <hi>Why doth a living man complaine, a man for the puniſhment of his ſins? Let us ſearch and try our wayes, and turne againe to the Lord;</hi> times of afflictions ſhould be times of inquiſition, when the Lord is ſmiting, we ſhould be ſearching; when we have received many wounds, it is time for us to be ſuſpecting our ſelves of many ſinnes; and the counſell of others is not to be rejected, when ſeing us in ſorrow, they adviſe us to conſider what our ſinnes are, how great, and how many. For though we ſhould be tender in preſſing thoſe who are under the load and burden of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with the burden of their ſinnes, yet they who are ſo, ſhall doe well and wiſely to preſſe it upon themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, Whereas <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſayth; <hi>Is not thy wickedneſſe great, and thine iniquitie infinite?</hi> and in the next verſe, concludes upon it; <hi>Thou haſt taken a pledge from thy brother for nought,</hi> &amp;c. All which were but conjectures and ſuſpitions.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>That ſuppoſitions and conjectures are no fit grounds, upon which to build a judgement concerning the faultines of others.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We muſt not Cenſure upon, <hi>I heare ſo, I ſuppoſe ſo, I thinke ſo,</hi> but upon, <hi>I know it is ſo;</hi> many have run into great ſinne by
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:153845:33"/> judging the ſins of others Great. <hi>Judge not</hi> (ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.1.) <hi>that ye be not judged.</hi> He ſpeakes not againſt all judgement, but eyther, firſt, againſt ſevere and harſh judging, or ſecondly, againſt falſe judging, or thirdly, againſt inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and raſh judging. When we judge without due ground, <hi>not knowing the why or wherefore</hi> of our Judgement, take heed of ſuch judging, <hi>that ye be not judged,</hi> that is, leſt having judged others unduely, ye receive your due in Judgement. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had nothing upon knowledge to charge <hi>Job</hi> for, yet while he queſtions, <hi>Is not thy wickedneſſe great?</hi> He doth more then ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly conclude that his ſin was very great, and his iniquities infinite. And in the next verſe in ſtead of querying, he comes to peremptory concluding;</p>

                     <hi>Job</hi> was a Magiſtrate, and this would have aggravated his ſin exceedingly, if it had been true; for any man to oppreſſe another is very wickedneſſe; but for a Magiſtrate who is ſet up to be a protector, a releiver of others, a helper of the freindleſſe, and a Judge of the widdow, for him to carry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe thus, for him to oppreſſe and grind the faces of the poore, is moſt tyrannicall.<note place="margin">Tyrannus eſt, qui ita domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, ut ad pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prium commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum &amp; utilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem omnia con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferat. <hi>Ariſt. lib. 4. polit. &amp; 1.

                     </note> Thus <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> defines a Tyrant; <hi>He is one that rules ſo as to turne all to his owne private benefit or profit;</hi> he that governs ſo, governs for himſelfe; Whereas true govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeekes and reſpects the good of others.

                  <p>There are three aggravations of his ſuppoſed ſinne in theſe words.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That he tooke a pledge.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That he tooke it of a brother.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That he tooke it for nought.</p>
                  <p>

A promiſe is an audible bond, but a pledge is a viſible bond. It is no ſinne in it ſelfe to take a pledge, no more then it is a ſinne to buy, ſell, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage a man any other way, to performe a bargaine, or repay a debt. The Law of God publiſhed by <hi>Moſes</hi> allowed the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a pledge, what is it then which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> chargeth upon <hi>Job</hi> as ſinfull in taking a pledge? I conceive there are two things which ſhew ſinfulneſs in taking a pledge, and that both are implyed here.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He intimates that <hi>Job</hi> did not waite to receive a pledge
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:153845:34"/> at the hand of his brother, but he did as it were ruſh in upon him, and tooke the pledge; for ſo tender was the Lord in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the poore of his People, or to thoſe that ſhould be in need to borrow of their brethren, and ſo give a pledge for ſecurity; that he giveth this ſpeciall order (<hi>Deut.</hi> 34.10.) <hi>When thou doſt lend thy brother any thing, thou ſhalt not goe into his houſe to fetch his pledge</hi> (it was not unlawful to receive a pledge from his brother, but to goe into his houſe was againſt the Law) <hi>but thou ſhalt ſtand abroad, and the man ſhall bring it out to thee.</hi> Some conceive that this was the ſinne charged upon <hi>Job; Thou haſt taken a pledge from thy brother, thou haſt not according to this expreſſe Law of God tarried for it;</hi> and ſuppoſing that <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> lived before the giving of that Law, yet the light of nature teacheth, that we ſhould not preſſe a man, or pull his pledge from him, but that the borrower ſhould goe into his houſe, and bringing his pledge, deliver it up freely with his owne hand into the hand of the lender. It is an affliction to have need to borrow,<note place="margin">Ipſa pignoris e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymologia, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere hominem videtur pignus non tam propria manu auferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ab invito &amp; miſero debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore, quam ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiendum non niſi ipſius debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toris manu ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latum: pignus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim appellatum eſt a <hi>pugno,</hi> quia res quae pignori dantur, manu tradun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Cajus</hi>
                     </note> and therefore the borrower ſhould be ſo tenderly dealt with by the lender as not to adde affliction to him. It is a curteſie to lend to him that is in need, but as ſome in giving, ſo moſt in lending ſpoyle all the curteſie of it; while they lend their money, they ſnatch or gripe at their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; whereas the old Law ſayd (the equity whereof, though not the formality, remaines to this day) <hi>Thou ſhalt not goe into thy brothers houſe to fetch his pledge, but thou ſhalt ſtand abroad and the man ſhall bring it out to thee.</hi> Some Critticks tells us that this is ſignified in the Etymologie of the Latine word, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a <hi>pledge.</hi> Namely, that the lender ſhould not take but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it from the hand of the borrower. It is the duty of bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowers to pay: <hi>The wicked borroweth and payeth not againe, (Pſal.</hi> 37.21.) The Apoſtles rule to the Godly is; <hi>Owe no man any thing but to love one another,</hi> (Rom. 13.8.) Now, as it is the duty of the borrower to pay, ſo of the lender to be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and not to exact or impoſe heavily upon him, for the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring of his payments. As he that buyeth ſhould be as if he bought not, ſo he that lends ſhould be (in this reſpect) as if he lent not; He ſhould lend with ſo much mildneſſe and meeknes of ſpirit, as if he gave, rather then lent; or as if (the contrary whereof <hi>Solomon</hi> found in his experience, <hi>Pro.</hi> 22.7.) himſelfe
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:153845:35"/> the lender, were ſervant to the borrower. <hi>Job</hi> is charged firſt with fayling in this; As if he had over eagerly preſſed upon his brother for a pledge; <hi>Thou haſt taken a pledge from thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The taking a pledge from a brother, may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of withholding a pledge when it is called for, or of the not reſtoring it, when the Covenants are performed. This is not onely to take it, but to take it away; ſuppoſe the pledge hath been given into a mans hand, yet if he will not reſtore it, or give it backe out of his hand when called for, but make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, or delayes, <hi>This is to take away the pledge.</hi> And thus ſome make out the ſin of the Text; <hi>Thou haſt taken a pledge;</hi> that is, thou haſt ſwept it quite away, thou haſt refuſed to reſtore the pledge, when that which was borrowed upon it, hath been in due time tendered to be payed or reſtored. The Prophet <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> (Chap. 18.14, 15, 16.) numbers the contrary practices among thoſe Negatives, for which the Lord declares himſelfe much pleaſed with the ſon of a wicked father; <hi>A ſon that ſeeth all his fathers ſinnes, that he hath done, and doth not ſuch like; that hath not eaten upon the mountaines, neither hath lift up his eyes to the idolls of the houſe of Iſraell; that hath not defiled his neighbours wife, neither hath oppreſſed any; that hath not withholden the pledge, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath ſpoyled by violence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he ſhall not dye for the iniquitie of his father, he ſhall ſurely live.</hi> Here ſinning in the matter of a pledge, is pitcht upon with-holding it, not upon taking it. For though a man have a pledge fayrely delivered up to him, though he doe not ruſh into the borrowers houſe, and there be his owne carver, taking what himſelfe liſteth to ſecure that which he hath lent, yet if he withhold the pledge when it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and deſired to be returned upon promiſed ſatisfaction made, this is very ſinfull and oppreſſive. Some when they get a good thing in their hands, they are loth to part with it, and will have a device to prove it forfeited by the borrower, when indeed, 'tis onely coveted by the lender.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>That violently to take or unjuſtly to detaine the pledge committed to us, is to act the part of the oppreſſor.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Law which ſaith; <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteale,</hi> doth as much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:153845:35"/> the detaining in our hands, as the laying of our hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which is our neighbours. And he that withholds the pledge when the debtor is ready and offers to redeem it, is like him that withholdes the debt when the lender deſires him, and he is able to repay it. Thou haſt taken or withholden <hi>a pledge.</hi> That's thy ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a further aggravation of ſinne in the words reſpecting the perſon from which the pledge was taken; A <hi>Brother: Thou haſt taken a pledge from thy brother.</hi> This addeth to the ſinne; we ſhould be kinde to all, but eſpecially to a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. A brother, may be taken either ſtrictly for one next or neere by birth or bloud, a brother by conſanguinity: ſuch are in the moſt proper ſence, our brethren and our owne fleſh. Or the word <hi>brother</hi> may be taken in a large ſenſe, for any that are neere to us, as being eyther of the ſame profeſſion of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with us, or living in the ſame Cit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>, ſociety, or under the ſame Government with us. Theſe are our brethren and our owne fleſh too. And ſo the Prophet calleth them even when pinched with hunger and nakedneſs, the more to move the bowels of our compaſſion towards them, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.7.) <hi>When thou ſeeſt the naked, that thou cover him, and that thou hide not thy ſelfe from thy owne fleſh;</hi> As richly cloathed as thou art, and as naked as they are, thine owne fleſh they are. When <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt taken a pledge from thy brother,</hi> he takes in brethren under all diſtinctions. This he adds to highten <hi>Jobs</hi> ſin; <hi>Thou tookeſt a pledge from thy brother.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>That as it is unjuſt and uncharitable to wrong any man, ſo moſt of all thoſe that are neere to us.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To wrong a brother of any latitude or degree is ſinfull, and ſtill the neerer the brother is, the more ſinfull it is to wrong him: the ſinne which a man commits againſt himſelfe is therefore greateſt of all, becauſe a man is neereſt to himſelfe; ſo in proportion the neerer any one is to us in any relation, the more we ſinne in wronging him. The Apoſtle puts it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that notion; <hi>If a brother or a ſiſter be naked, and deſtitute of dayly food,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.15. And againe, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Whoſoever hath this worlds good, and ſeeth his brother have need and ſhutteth up
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:153845:36"/> his bowels of compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> That is, the love of God doth not at all dwell in him, or at beſt it dwelleth very poorly and undiſcernably in him. To ſee ſtrangers yea enemies deſtitute and not relieve them, is uncharitable; but to ſee a brother or a ſiſter, and chiefly a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or a ſiſter in ſpirituall relation (for of ſuch I conceive the Apoſtle ſpeakes particularly, in thoſe places, I ſay, to ſee ſuch) deſtitute and not to releive them, this is higheſt uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſs.</p>
                  <p>Againe, Some render thus, (not <hi>thou haſt taken a pledge from thy brother,</hi> but) <hi>Thou haſt taken thy brother for a pledge.</hi> This ſpeakes yet louder, and is a ſin of a blacker colour then the former; thou haſt not onely taken thy brothers pledge, but himſelfe, his very perſon for ſecurity or for payment. But what is it to take a mans brother for a pledge?<note place="margin">In pignus acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſti fratres tuos. <hi>Sept.</hi>

Or ſecondly (which was uſed in ancient times) <hi>Thou haſt taken thy brother for a pledge,</hi> that is, thou haſt made him thy ſlave: To be caſt into priſon is a ſlavery, and a man may be made a ſlave, yet not impriſoned. And though it may be a duty (when we have nothing elſe to ſatisfie it with) to worke out a debt, yet it is a very high ſeverity to force a deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to pay with his worke.

                     <hi>Thou haſt taken a pledge of thy brother for nought;</hi> or without cauſe; This word was opened (<hi>Chap.</hi> 1.9.) where Satan ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts againſt <hi>Jobs</hi> ſincerity, <hi>doth Job ſerve God for nought.</hi> And againe (<hi>Chap.</hi> 2.3.) where the Lord aſſerts and vindicates the ſincerity of <hi>Job</hi> againſt Satans calumniations; <hi>Thou movedſt me againſt him to deſtroy him without cauſe;</hi> That is, thou hadſt no cauſe to move me ſo againſt him; he is no ſuch mercenary ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant as thou haſt maliciouſly pretended. Thus here; <hi>Thou haſt taken a pledge of thy brother for nought, or without cauſe;</hi> that is, without any neceſſary cauſe, there was no reaſon thou ſhouldeſt take a pledge from thy brother when thou tookeſt it; thou mighteſt have truſted him, but thou wouldeſt not any further then thou hadſt full ſecurity put into thy hand, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then thou didſt take it into thy hand, whether he would or no. As if he had ſayd; Thou wouldeſt not releive thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers poverty, upon the promiſes which God makes to thoſe who charitably releive the poore; thou wouldeſt neyther take Gods word, nor truſt thy brother in any caſe, further then thou didſt ſee him; unleſſe he would put into thy hand, thou wouldeſt not put into his. True charity muſt and will make ſome ventures; <hi>Caſt thy bread upon the waters</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon Eccl.</hi> 11.1.) A good man is a Merchant and will truſt his bread where he hath no more aſſurance of a ſafe returne, then the Merchant hath of his Ship and Lading from the winds and waters.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:153845:37"/>Thou haſt taken a pledge of thy brother.</q>
                  <p>Againe, <hi>Without cauſe or for nought,</hi> may have this meaning, thou didſt oblidge thy brother to reſtore that which really and indeed he never received from thee; thou didſt put a debt to thy brothers account which he never made by borrowing.<note place="margin">Solent divites fingere ſe cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditores &amp; alioe debitores.</note> 
                     <hi>David</hi> complaines of ſuch kinde of unkinde uſage (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.4.) <hi>They that hate me without cauſe, are moe then the hayres of my head: They that would deſtroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: then I reſtored that which I tooke not away;</hi> That is, which I tooke not away, eyther as borrowed of them, or as ſtolne from them. I was neyther a debter, nor a theife, I had nothing of theirs in my hands, yet I was forced to reſtore. This is the worſt ſort of <hi>taking a pledge for nought.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>For nought;</hi> That is, when there was no reaſon to take ſo great a pledge of thy brother, the thing which thou didſt lend him was but ſome trifle, yet thou wouldeſt have a pledge of thy brother for it; thou wouldeſt have great ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for an inconſiderable debt; that's the courſe of many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors, by lending a little they will have much to ſecure it. And this is to take a pledge from a brother for nought, there ſhould be ſome equality between the debt and the ſecurity, he that lends a trifle, a ſmall matter, and requires great aſſurance, takes a pledge of his brother for nought. So that all unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and unequall demands for ſecurity, eyther taking (where charity bids us truſt) from the poore, or taking it (where in juſtice we ſhould not take any thing) when nothing was lent, or when there is no reaſon we ſhould take ſo much; any of theſe harſh and injurious practices, is the <hi>taking a pledge of our brother for nought.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve;
<q>That the leſſe cauſe we have to doe any evill, the greater is the evill which we doe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But hath any man a cauſe to doe any evill; he hath not; by cauſe I meane a provocation; there is no cauſe for which we ſhould doe any evill, but there may be many provocations or temptations to doe evill; <hi>Peninah</hi> provoked <hi>Hannah</hi> ſore to make her fret (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.6.) It was not for nought or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe that <hi>Moſes</hi> his paſſion was ſtirr'd, and that he ſpake
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:153845:37"/> unadviſedly with his lips, the murmuring and complainings of that unſteady people <hi>provoked his Spirit.</hi> (Pſal. 106.33.) Now the leſſe provocation, the greater alwayes is the ſinne; as to ſinne againſt admonition, or againſt any of thoſe meanes that might keepe us from ſinne, makes the ſin greater, ſo when there is no occaſion leading us unto ſinne. This was one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of greatening the ſin of our firſt parents in eating the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit; why did they eate? were they ready to ſtarve? were they in any ſtreights? had they not the whole garden before them? did they not <hi>eate the forbidden fruit without cauſe, or for nought? Solomon</hi> ſaith (<hi>Pro.</hi> 6.30.) <hi>Men doe not deſpiſe a theife, if he ſteale to ſatisfie his ſoule when he is hungry;</hi> for though to ſteale for meere hunger doth not take away the ſinfullnes of the fact, yet it doth much abate it; becauſe the man is provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to doe it for the ſupply of his preſent and preſſing need; But for a rich man (who hath no need) to ſteale, for a man to ſteale who is not hungry, how ſinfull is it! Our greateſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities cannot wholly excuſe our ſin, but to ſin where there is no neceſſity, doth greatly encreaſe our ſinne. <hi>Saul</hi> thought he ſhould come off without blame, when he had ſo much to ſay for his raſh ſacrifice (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.12.) <hi>I ſaid the Philiſtines will come downe upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made ſupplication unto the Lord; I forced my ſelfe therefore, and offered a burnt offering.</hi> But doth <hi>Samuel</hi> approve this plea? We have his reſolution in the next verſe; <hi>Thou haſt done fooliſhly, thou haſt not kept the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the Lord thy God.</hi> Though <hi>Saul</hi> found himſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a moral force to doe what he did, yet that did not free him eyther from guilt or puniſhment when he ventured to doe it. <hi>David</hi> ſmarted for numbring <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though <hi>Satan ſtood up againſt Iſrael, and provoked David to number them</hi> (1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.1.) What ſhall we ſay then of thoſe, who doe more then <hi>David</hi> altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unprovoked by Satan, who rather tempt themſelves, then are tempted unto evill? As the Good we doe is ſo much the better, ſo the evill we doe is by ſo much the worſe, by how much we doe it the more freely and unconſtrained. Thus <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> aggravates the firſt Inſtance of <hi>Jobs</hi> ſuppoſed wickedneſs. To take a pledge from a man in the manner expounded, is not onely illiberal, but ſinfull; To take a pledge from a brother in diſtreſſe is more ſinfull, but to take a pledge of a brother for
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:153845:38"/> nought, is a degree of ſin, which hath many degrees of ſinfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes beyond both the former. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> hath yet but begun <hi>Jobs</hi> Inditement, this is the firſt Crime objected; A ſecond, and a third, and more are following. <hi>Thou haſt taken a pledge of thy brother for nought,</hi>
                     <q>And ſtript the naked of their Clothing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be queſtioned; If they were naked, how could they be ſtript of their clothing? he that is naked hath no cloaths to be ſtript of.<note place="margin">Nudus nec a centum viris ſpoliatur.</note> 'Tis gon into a Proverb, <hi>A naked man cannot be ſtript by a hundred men;</hi> hee that hath nothing, can looſe nothing. How then is it ſaid here; <hi>Thou haſt ſtript the naked of their cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer; <hi>The naked,</hi> are not here to be taken ſtrictly for ſuch as have no cloaths at all, but for thoſe who have but few cloaths, or for ſuch as are but meanly and thinly clothed; any that are poore and low, any who are in want, may be numbred among the naked. 'Tis frequent, as in Scripture, ſo in Common ſpeech to expreſſe thoſe as beeing quite without that of which they have but little.<note place="margin">Quaedam etia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſi vera non ſint propter ſimilitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem eodem vocabulo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenja ſunt; ſic qui male ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitum &amp; pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> videt nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ſe vidiſſe dicit <hi>Sen. l. 5.

                     </note> Wee ſay of a man that hath but a little knowledge, he is an Ignorant man; and of a man who hath but a little learning, that he is an Illiterate, or an unlearned man. Thus we may ſay of a man that hath but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtore of cloaths, little ſtore of the world about him, that he is naked, that he hath nothing. The Apoſtle uſeth this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.11.) <hi>Even to this preſent houre, wee both hunger, and thirſt, and are naked,</hi> &amp;c. not that the Apoſtles went about without cloaths, but they were but mean in their Apparrell, poore in their Appearances, and that he calls nakednes. So the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> in the ſecond Chapter of that Epiſtle, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>If a Brother or a Siſter be naked,</hi> &amp;c. Hee doth not mean it onely of ſuch as have never a ragg to cover their nakedneſs, but of ſuch as are ill furniſhed with cloaths. The Lord threatens his owne People (<hi>Deut.</hi> 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> from the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>ver.</hi> to the 48<hi rend="sup">th</hi>) in caſe of their diſobedience, with this affliction; <hi>Becauſe thou ſervedſt not the Lord with gladneſs of heart in the abundance of all things, therefore thou ſhalt ſerve thine enemies in hunger, and in thirſt, and in nakednes,</hi> &amp;c. That is, thou ſhalt not have thy Wardrobes ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and filled with change of rayment, but thou ſhalt feele
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:153845:38"/> and be pincht with want and poverty. So here; <hi>Thou haſt ſtript the naked of their clothing;</hi> That is, thoſe that were ill clothed, thou haſt uncloathed, and in ſtead of releiving their wants, thou haſt encreaſed them.</p>
                  <p>And thus the words may allude to the taking of a Pledge, about which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpake before; <hi>Thou haſt ſtript the naked of their cloathing;</hi> That is, thou haſt taken a pledge from thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and ſtript him quite of it. Therefore the Law provided againſt this oppreſſion (<hi>Exod.</hi> 22.26.) <hi>If thou at all take thy neighbours rayment to pledge, thou ſhalt deliver it to him before the Sunne goe downe, for it is his Covering.</hi> The breach of which Law is diſcovered and reproved (<hi>Amos</hi> 2.8.) <hi>And they lay themſelves downe upon cloathes layd to pledge;</hi> That is, they detained them all night, whereas they ſhould have delivered them before the going downe of the Sunne. And thus their ſin is aggravated in that it is ſayd in the next words, that they did this <hi>by every Altar.</hi> It was their ſin to make many Altars. And this encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their ſin, that they durſt doe acts of wrong to men, where they pretended to worſhip God.<note place="margin">Chaldeus legit lectulos oppig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratos Vel certe pro illo ipſo veſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento quo &amp; ſe operit inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diu, at<expan>

                        </expan> noctu etiam jacons ſe contegit.</note> The like Law is given about the Pledge, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.6. <hi>No man ſhall take the upper, or the nether mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone to pledge, for he taketh a mans life to pledge;</hi> That is, he takes the thing away without which he cannot live; If his milſtone be taken away from the Mill, how ſhall he grinde his Corne, to make bread, which is the Staff of life? And againe at the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of the ſame Chapter, the Law is renewed in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to rayment; <hi>In any caſe thou ſhalt deliver the pledge againe before the Sun goeth downe, that he may ſleepe in his owne Rayment and Bleſs thee, and it ſhall be Righteouſneſs unto thee before the Lord thy God.</hi> Thus wee may conceive <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpeaking here, though not eying that expreſs Law, yet from the Common light of nature, which teacheth that the poore and naked ſhould not be ſtript of that little proviſion and ſmall pittance which ſerves onely to protect them from cold and ſtarving.</p>
                  <p>Further, By theſe words; <hi>Thou haſt ſtript the naked of their Cloathing]</hi> Wee may underſtand not cloathing onely, but all the neceſſaries of this life, any thing which is of ſuch concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to our lives as our Cloaths are; for as bread in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is put for all the neceſſaries of this life; So is Cloathing. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 3.6. <hi>When a man ſhall take hold of his Brother, ſaying; Thou
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:153845:39"/> haſt Cloathing; Be thou Ruler over us,</hi> &amp;c. Thou haſt cloathing, that is, thou haſt goods, thou haſt an Eſtate, thou canſt make proviſion for us; there <hi>Cloathing</hi> is put for all outward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, as in other Scriptures <hi>Bread</hi> is. So that according to the extent of this interpretation, <hi>Thou haſt ſtript the naked of their Cloathing,</hi> takes in all ſorts of bodily grievances put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the poore.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>That to oppreſs the poore is the higheſt and greateſt oppreſſion.</q>
                  <p>It is our duty to Cloath the naked, how great then is their ſin who ſtrip the naked of their cloathing? it is ſinfull &amp; unjuſt violently to take cloaths from him that hath greateſt variety of cloathing, wee may not rob the rich, what is it then to take from them who have not? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oe (as we ſay) <hi>to rob the Hoſpitall. Solomon</hi> (Prov. 28.3.) tels us of an oppreſſion which is very grievous, and that is the oppreſſion of a poore man, which is true both actively and paſſively, when the poore man is the oppreſſor, 'tis ſo, 'tis ſo alſo when the poore man is the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. <hi>Solomon</hi> intends both, for he makes the poore to be the oppreſſed, and a poore man the oppreſſor. <hi>The poore man that oppreſſeth the poore is as a ſweeping raine, which leaveth no food.</hi> 'Tis worſe with the poore when the poore oppreſſe them, then when the rich oppreſs them, the rich may oppreſs them much, but they come not ſo neere, as when a poore man oppreſſeth; for as the imbecilitie of the oppreſſed poore man can give him no helpe, ſo the neceſſity of the oppreſſing poore man will ſhew him no mercy. Nothing doth more harden the heart of a man then his owne want, and he hath little feeling of anothers miſery, who is under the feeling of his own: He that hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing takes what he can get, and his owne hunger devoureth all. The rich man oppreſſing the poore is <hi>a daſhing raine,</hi> the great man oppreſſing the poore is <hi>a thundering raine,</hi> but the poore man oppreſſing the poore <hi>is a ſweeping raine.</hi> As they who never knew poverty, ſo they who know it moſt, have the leaſt ſtocke of pitie for the poore. Such are a ſweeping raine indeed. There is a refreſhing, a fatning, a filling raine, which the Lord ſends upon the thirſty Earth, this produceth ſtore of food. It raines corne and wine, milke and butter; There is alſo a
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:153845:39"/> ſweeping raine that takes away food, and deſtroyes the fruits of the Earth. Such a raine is a poore man oppreſſing the poore. <hi>Want is the greateſt ſpoyler.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Wee may expound the Text thus; <hi>And ſtript the naked of their Cloathing;</hi> That is, Thou haſt ſtript them till they are naked; for in Scripture wee finde the denomination to be taken from the End of the action, or that which the action tends to. As to Illuſtrate it a little (<hi>Eſa.</hi> 47.2.) <hi>Take the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones, and grinde meale.</hi> Now wee doe not grinde meale, but whole Corne to make meale. So (<hi>Eſay</hi> 44.15.) <hi>Hee baketh Bread;</hi> Now we doe not bake bread, but dough, that it may come to be bread, when it is bread once it needs no more bake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So (<hi>Dan.</hi> 2.21.) <hi>He giveth wiſdome to the wiſe;</hi> that is, he giveth wiſdome to thoſe who before were rude, and ſo makes them wiſe. Thus here, the denomination of the act is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from that to which the act hath a tendency, <hi>Thou haſt ſtript the naked,</hi> not that they who are naked indeed can be ſtript, but thou haſt ſtript them, &amp; ſo made them naked. This very phraſe is uſed (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.3.) <hi>Leſt I ſtrip thee naked,</hi> ſaith the Lord to the Church, that is, leſt in ſtripping thee I leave thee naked, leſt I take away all the good things with which thou art Encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed. So here, <hi>Thou haſt ſtript the naked of their Cloathing;</hi> That is, thou haſt ſtript them till thou haſt made them naked.</p>
                  <p>From this learne;
<q>That there is ſuch a Principle of unnaturalneſſe in the nature of man, as to take away all, and leave nothing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wee finde more then Cloaths taken away by ſome, they goe cloſer then to the cloathing (as the Lord complaines, <hi>Mic.</hi> 3.3.) <hi>Who eate the fleſh of a People, and flay their skin from off their backs;</hi> There's oppreſſion and cruelty in blackeſt colours, they will not leave them ſo much as their skin upon their backes. Skin is naturall Cloathing, as Garments are Artificiall Cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Theſe tooke away not onely the cloathing which art, but that which nature had provided and put upon them, they flayed their skin from off their backes. Yet we are not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that they were ſo cruel to pull off their skin, but becauſe they would have all to their very skin, therefore they are ſayd to take skin and all. They who are ſo unmercifull, that they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:153845:40"/> will not leave a ragge to cover the skin, are juſtly charged with that unmercifullneſs, which will not leave ſo much as their skin to cover their fleſh, yea, (as it followes in the ſame place) <hi>that they would gnaw their bones,</hi> they will have all, Cloaths, skin and bones, from another, rather then not have enough for themſelves. <hi>Cruelty joyned with Covetouſneſſe, knows no bounds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eliphaz</hi> having thus ſhewed ſome of thoſe particular evills, which he ſuppoſed <hi>Job</hi> had done, proceeds to ſhew what Good he had not don. <hi>Sins of omiſſion render a man as foule and vile, as ſins of commiſſion doe.</hi> He that doth not the good which he ought and can, doth evill.</p>

                  <p>Water is a very Common thing, and the word which is here uſed takes in all naturall waters, the whole Element of water. Seing then water is not under lock &amp; key, but lyes open to all commers, how comes it to be any mans gift? I anſwer, firſt, If we underſtand the words literally &amp; ſtrictly, yet ſomtimes &amp; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in ſome places to give a cup of water to drinke, or a buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of water to waſh in, is no ſmall charity to a wearied tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller. But ſecondly (I conceive) <hi>Job</hi> is taxed with <hi>not giving water,</hi> to ſhew his refuſing to doe the ſmalleſt charity. So wee finde it expreſſed (<hi>Matth.</hi> 10.42.) when Jeſus Chriſt would aſſure us that the leaſt office of love or reſpect which we doe to a diſtreſſed Saint, to a Beleever upon that account as he is a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever,<note place="margin">Non inania in eos etiam levia quae ſub frigidae aquae nomine deſignat officia eſſe decerint. <hi>Hilar.</hi>
                     </note> ſhall be rewarded, hee gives it in this language; <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall give to drinke to one of theſe little ones a Cup of Cold water onely in the name of a Diſciple, verily I ſay unto you, hee ſhall not loſe his reward.</hi> As by one of theſe <hi>little ones,</hi> he meanes any, the leaſt of Beleevers, or righteous Perſons; ſo by the gift that he ſpeaks of, <hi>water,</hi> or <hi>Cold water, a Cup of Cold water,</hi> he meanes the leaſt of favours. Cold water is a cheape commodity, and a little cold water, onely a cup of it, cannot (as ſome things cannot becauſe they are worth ſo much) be prized, becauſe it is worth ſo little, yet he that gives but this little thing, this (almoſt) nothing in the name of a Diſciple, <hi>hee ſhall not loſe his reward.</hi>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:153845:40"/> So here to ſet forth the hardneſs of <hi>Jobs</hi> heart (as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived) he puts it in theſe termes, <hi>Thou haſt not given water,</hi> (no not cold water) <hi>to thoſe that are weary;</hi> As if he had ſaid, thou haſt not onely denyed a feaſt, or a banquet of wine, which might put thee to ſome coſt and charges, but thou haſt denyed then, water, cold water, which is not chargeable at all, which doth not ſo much as put thee to the coſt of a little fire to heat it, or of any ingredient to mix with it, thou haſt denyed them this cheapeſt charity.<note place="margin">—venit viliſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma rerum Hîc aqua, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.

                  <p>That is, thou haſt not given water to them to whom it doth moſt properly belong, or who had perfect need of it, <hi>the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the thirſty.</hi> There are ſome to whom wee may very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to give water, or any other refreſhment of nature; they have enough, if not too much already, not onely in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as the rich, but in uſe or abuſe rather, as the intemperate and the drunken; To give water to ſuch is to powre water into the Sea; but thou haſt not given it to the weary, not to thoſe who are like the dry and parched ground.</p>
                  <p>In that the matter of charity is placed in water, obſerve;
<q>That charity is accepted, and uncharitablenes condemned in the ſmalleſt matter.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not the quantity of the gift, but the affection of the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it is not the quantity of that which is denyed to be given, but the heart of him that denyes it, which the Lord takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of: be it much or be it little that is given, if it be given with an honeſt and willing minde, the Lord accepts it, and be it much or be it little that is denyed, if it be denyed with a churliſh and uncharitable ſpirit, the Lord is diſpleaſed with it: and the leſſe that is which is denyed, the more ſinfull is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal, &amp; the more is the Lord diſpleaſed with it. When cruſts or crums of bread, which fall from our Table, are denyed, when a cup of cold water is denyed, how cold is charity? and is it not
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:153845:41"/> crumbled into a leſſer nothing then thoſe crums? Wee ſhould honour the Lord with our ſubſtance, and our charity ſhould not onely have coſt in it, but liberality in it, how doe they honor God with their ſubſtance, who will hardly give to him (that is, to his poor) the ſhadow of their ſubſtance? If the Lord ſhould command us to give ſome great thing, to teſtifie our charity, ſhould we not doe it? how much more when he ſaith give but water to the weary for my ſake, and I account you charitable.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>That Churliſh and hard hearted Perſons ſtick at ſmall matters as well as at great.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is ſuppoſed (<hi>Acts</hi> 5.15.) that the very ſhadow of <hi>Peter</hi> was healing to the ſicke. There are ſome ſo hard-hearted, that they would hardly beſtow their ſhadow upon the poore to doe them good. It troubles them to part with the leaſt Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable Benefit, or to doe the leaſt Imaginable courteſie, not onely great things, but ſmall things, even the ſmalleſt things, the chippings of their loafe, the parings of their apple, yea the very huskes which their ſwine eate (as the letter of the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble concerning the prodigal intimates, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.16.) are ſtuck at as too much for them who have nothing. And thus the heart of a wicked man is ſtated to the whole buſineſſe of obedience; his heart is as much againſt obedience in a ſmall matter, as in a great, he is ſo farre from ſwallowing the camell of holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he ſtraines at the very gnats of it; and if a mans ſpirit be againſt obedience it ſelfe in its owne nature, if his ſpirit be unſutable to it, let it be a duty of the leaſt or loweſt degree, he cannot but ſticke at it. The ſervants of <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> ſayd to him; <hi>Had the Prophet bid thee doe ſome great matter, woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou not have done it? how much more when he ſaith unto thee, Waſh in Jordan and be cleane.</hi> There is a reaſon why wee ſhould rather doe ſmall things then great as to the outward act, but, I ſay, if the ſpirit of a man be croſſe-grayn'd and lie againſt the duty, he is as unfit and as back-ward to doe a little as to doe a great deale; he will not ſo much as give water to God or man, or if he doe give it, he doth not give it with a heart let out in love to God, or in compaſſion to the moſt needy man. It is a hard matter with him to give or doe at all, but it is an
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:153845:41"/> impoſſible matter for him to give or doe with a ready or chearefull minde. Thus the Covetous man, the hard-hearted worldling cannot give ſo much as water: a worldly man ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thinks that himſelfe hath enough of the world, and he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thinks that others have too little, when he is full he thinks all others are full enough too. Such narrow-hearted crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the Prophet <hi>Iſayah</hi> deſcribes (<hi>Chap.</hi> 32.6, 7.) who as they <hi>practiſe hypocriſie and utter error againſt the Lord,</hi> ſo they pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe oppreſſion and utter cruelty againſt man, <hi>to make empty the ſoule of the hungry, and to cauſe the drinke of the thirſty to fayle. The Inſtruments alſo of the Churle are evill.</hi> What Inſtruments doth he meane? Some ſay, the inſtruments of his commerce, his weights and meaſures, he pincheth the poore there, that's true, thoſe inſtruments of the churliſh Merchant or Tradſman are evill. Yet wee may rather expound it more largely for all the meanes, whether perſons or things, whether agents &amp; under-officers, or courſes and devices, which the churliſh man uſeth as inſtruments to compaſſe and bring about his purpoſes; all theſe ſavour of himſelfe, they are evill, that is, falſe, treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and lying in waite to deceive. For (as it followe) <hi>He deviſeth wicked devices to deſtroy the poore with lying words, even when the needy ſpeaketh right,</hi> or (as wee put in the margin) <hi>when he ſpeaketh againſt the poore in Judgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note;
<q>That a little is much reckoned upon by thoſe that are in need, or have nothing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Water is a welcome mercy to the thirſty, to the weary, to thoſe who are ready to dye with heate and travell. The rich man in hell would have been glad of a drop of water to coole his tongue. <hi>Sicera</hi> the General of <hi>Jabins</hi> Army, beggs of <hi>Jael,</hi> to give him a little water, for (ſaith he) <hi>I am thirſty.</hi> (Judg. 4.19.) The full ſoule loathes the hony-Combe, that which is ſweet and delicious the full ſtomack loathes it, but they that are weary, hungry and thirſty, a piece of bread, a Cup of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, how pleaſant! how ſweet! Such are glad of any thing, who are in want of all things. Much is little to them who have much, a little is much to them who have but little. The weary will thanke you more for water, then the wanton will for
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:153845:42"/> wine. The weary asked but for water to drinke, and could not get it, thou wouldeſt not give it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> deſcribing a wicked man, fixes moſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſinne, his unmercifulneſſe to the poore. And there is a generall truth in it.</p>
                  <q>That to be without Compaſſion to the poore, is the marke of a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man.</q>
                  <p>They who have found the compaſſion of God to their own ſoules (as every godly man hath) cannot ſhut up the bowels of their compaſſion towards the pined body of man. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>John</hi> puts the queſtion (1 <hi>Ep:</hi> 3.17.) <hi>How dwelleth the love of God in him,</hi> that doth ſo? The love of God, eyther as taken for the love of God to us, or for our love to God, dwelleth not in him, in whom there dwells no love to man. Now, if the love of God dwell not in a man, God dwelleth not in him, and if God dwell not in him, Satan doth; and what can he be called but <hi>wicked,</hi> in whom <hi>the wicked,</hi> or <hi>the evill one</hi> dwelleth? Thus the wicked <hi>Edomites</hi> dealt with the people of God, when they were wearied in their March thorow the Wilderneſſe. Wee read the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> thus beſpeaking the <hi>Edomites (Numb.</hi> 20.17, 18, 19.) <hi>Let us paſs I pray thee thorow thy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, wee will not paſs thorow the fields, or thorow the vineyards, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will wee drinke of the water of the wells,</hi> &amp;c. wee will put you to no trouble, no charge, wee will be content with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon waters which we finde abroad, this is all that wee deſire when wee ſhall be weary and thirſty in our travells. And <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> ſaid unto him, <hi>Thou ſhalt not paſs by mee, leaſt I Cutt thee off with the ſword: And the Children of Iſrael ſayd unto him, wee will goe by the high way, and if I and my Cattell drinke of thy water, I will pay thee for it, I will onely</hi> (without doeing any thing elſe) <hi>goe thorow on my feet.</hi> See what a ſpirit <hi>Edom</hi> was of; when <hi>Iſrael</hi> put it to the loweſt, wee will drinke none of the water of your wells, or if we doe we will pay for it; No, <hi>Edom</hi> was ſo hard-hearted, that he would neyther give, nor ſell them water; they ſhall not have it eyther of free coſt, or for money; thus uncompaſſionate was hee towards a People that were travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that were weary and thirſty. The Inhabitants of <hi>Tema</hi> are commended for their tendernes to men in diſtreſſe (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 21.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:153845:42"/> 14.) <hi>They brought water to him that was thirſty, they prevented with their bread him that fled;</hi> They gave water and bread unasked; The wants of the diſtreſſed moved them, though they made no motion for the ſupply of their wants. They act moſt like God who prevent us with their favours. Even the light of nature leads to it. How unnatural then are they who deny water to them who being weary and thirſty begge for it! The mercy of God by Jeſus Chriſt is highly Commended to us upon this Conſideration, that he gives it not onely in bounty, but in Compaſſion, there is not onely liberality, but there is a pity in it: therefore he ſaith (<hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28.) <hi>Come unto me all yee that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> To give eaſe and refreſhment to thoſe that are weary and heavy laden, hath not onely bounty &amp; liberality, but Pity and Compaſſion in it. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 136.23.) <hi>Thanks to God who hath remembred us in our low Eſtate.</hi> It is an act of grace for God to remember us in our higheſt Eſtate, in our moſt flouriſhing Eſtate, but to remember us in our low Eſtate, then to give us in refreſhings and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, this is a clearer act of Grace. As it is ſaid (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 68.9.) <hi>Thou O God, didſt ſend a plentifull raine, whereby thou didſt confirme thine inheritance when it was weary.</hi> As the goodneſſe of God is moſt ſeene in giving water to the weary, ſo is the wickedneſſe of man in denying it. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> urgeth <hi>Job</hi> further with this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſſe.</p>
                  <q>And thou haſt withholdden bread from the hungry.</q>
                  <p>He gave no water, and he <hi>withheld bread.</hi> The word is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times rendred <hi>to hide, to deny,</hi>

The Greekes and ſome Latines Interpret this ſtrictly of a morſell of bread, <hi>Thou haſt withholden a morſell of bread,</hi> as the rich man in the Goſpel did, <hi>Lazarus</hi> deſired but the crummes that fell from his Table, but could not get them. So here, thou haſt withholdden not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a full Table, but a morſell of Bread; This latter clauſe and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:153845:43"/> the former are of the ſame ſence, yet from that word <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden,</hi> which Implyeth a wrong done to the poore, note firſt;
<q>That the poore have a right in what rich men have.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if they withhold all from them, they ſhall be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, not onely as uncharitable and illiberall, but as oppreſſors and unjuſt; not onely as not having given them reliefe, but as not having done them right. (<hi>Prov.</hi> 3.27.) <hi>Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the Power of thy hand to doe it.</hi> A thing is due upon a double account; firſt, by the Law of Juſtice; ſecondly, by the Law of Love: I conceive here that the Proverb is to be underſtood of a dueneſs, not by the Lawes of Common Juſtice (as if a man have his brothers Eſtate in his hand, he cannot withhold it from him without tranſgreſſing the Law of Juſtice) but of a dueneſs by the Law of Love, or more ſtrictly by the Law of Charity: thus 'tis a duty to doe good to thoſe that are in want; it is not onely a favour that wee ſhew to them when wee releive them, but there is a duty in it which wee owe to God, who hath commanded that their poverty ſhould be ſupplyed by the plenty &amp; abundance which he hath given to others. If therefore it be demanded, who are they to whom this doing of good is due? I anſwer, not onely they to whom thou art endebted in Juſtice, <hi>witnes thy hand and ſeale;</hi> but even they to whom thou art endebted in charity, <hi>witnes their want and need.</hi> The poore have a right to what we are able to give, and can conveniently ſpare; yea ſometimes their right may lye ſomewhat beyond the line of our conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency. So then there is a poynt of Juſtice in it, as well as of charity in releiving the poore; and if (as the next words in <hi>Solomon</hi> imply) it be ſinfull to delay them till to morrow, it muſt needes be a wickednes to deny them for ever. Therefore the ſame <hi>Solomon (Prov.</hi> 22.2.) ſpeaking of the poore and the rich puts them together; <hi>The rich and poore meet together, the Lord is the maker of them all;</hi> Now the Lord is the maker of the poore and of the rich, not only in their naturall conſtitution, as they are men conſiſting of body and ſoule, (ſo indeed he hath made the poor as well as the rich, and they are both alike the worke of his hands) but the Lord is the maker of them in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:153845:43"/> that capacity or ſtate wherein they are, he makes the rich man and the poore man, that is, hee makes the one rich, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poore, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the maker of them both, and <hi>Solomon</hi> (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) puts that in to ſhew firſt, that poore men ſhould not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy the rich man, why? for the Lord hath made him rich; why ſhould thine Eye be Evill, becauſe the Lords Eye is good?</p>
                  <p>And againe, that the rich man ſhould not deſpiſe the poore, or withdraw the bowells of his Compaſſion from them, the Lord could have made thee poore too if hee had pleaſed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be Compaſſionate towards them, for the Lord is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of you both. And this anſwers that objection commonly given by ſome, why, are not my goods my owne, may I not do with them as I pleaſe? I have not ſtolne them, I have wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged no man in the obtaining them; it is well when men can ſay thus, that they have done no wrong in getting riches: but this is no argument (how juſtly ſoever any man hath got his Eſtate) that he ſhould keepe it all to himſelfe, and not give a portion to thoſe that are in want. The rich man withholds what is due to the poor, when he withholds releife from them. It is true your Eſtate is your owne, it is yours, no man can challenge or claime it from you; I, but God can claime it from you; you are poſſeſſors and maſters of your Eſtate in reference unto men, but you are but Stewards and Servants of your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate in reference unto God. Now a Stewards buiſineſſe (you know) is not only to receive and lay up the Eſtate of his Lord or Maſter, but 'tis his buiſines alſo to pay or lay out according as he receives command or order from his Lord; thus it is in this Caſe; Rich men are but Stewards to the Lord in reference to all that they have; Therefore as they receive from him, and partake of the fullnes of the Earth which is his (for the Earth is the Lords and the fullnes thereof) ſo they muſt iſſue it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his order and command: Now he hath left a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing order for all times, that the rich ſhould diſtribute to the neceſſities of the poore and hungry. Rich men muſt not thinke themſelves Stewards onely to receive in, but alſo to pay out what their Lord calls for, and therefore as they would give a good account of their Stewardſhip at the great Audit day, let them take heed how they <hi>withhold bread from the hungry.</hi> I might ſhew further, that the rich are not onely obliged to give, or
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:153845:44"/> that it is their duty to give, but that they ought to give chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and readily, not upon conſtraint (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7.) that they ought to give liberally and bountifully, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> with reſtraint, and that they ought to give ſincerely, not thinking thereby eyther to merit at the hand of God, or to get the praiſe of men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From the matter of this charge, <hi>Thou haſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden bread from the hungry,</hi> we may obſerve, That
<q>Not to doe good, or the omiſſion of doing good to the poore, renders us culpable as well as the doing or Commiſſion of that which is evill or injurious to them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not to releive the poore is a ſin as well at to injure or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the poore, yea not to releive hath injurie and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in it. The reaſon of it is cleare from the former poynt, becauſe the poore have a right to ſo much of a rich mans e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate as is a releife of their preſſing neceſſities, to preſerve them from periſhing. And every man muſt acknowledge that to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny any man his right (by what title ſoever that right ariſeth) is to oppreſſe him. Nor is it enough to give them good words (which yet is more then ſome will give) unleſſe we doe them good. (<hi>Jam.</hi> 2.15, 16.) <hi>If a Brother or a Siſter be naked, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of dayly food, and one of you ſay unto them depart in peace, be warmed and filled, yet notwithſtanding yee give them not thoſe things which are needfull to the body, what doth it profit?</hi> Though you give them good words, yet if you give them no ſupply, what doth it profit? Wee may underſtand it two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, What doth it profit the poore? Can they feed upon your good words? or will your good words cloath them? what doth it profit them if yee ſay be fed and be cloathed, if you give them neyther food nor rayment.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What profit is it to you who ſay ſo? will God take it well at your hands, that you have ſpoken kindly to the poore, when you did them no kindneſſe? therefore withhold not thy hand, &amp;c. And if it be ſo great a ſin to withhold our bread from the hungry, what is it to take their bread from them? <hi>Eliphaz</hi> having thus taxed <hi>Job</hi> with neglect of the poore, he proceeds in the next verſe to taxe him with an undue and partiall reſpect to the rich. As he was rigid to to them who
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:153845:44"/> had nothing, ſo he was indulgent to thoſe who had enough, if not more then enough, before.</p>

                  <p>Againe, Some underſtand here by the <hi>arme</hi> of the wicked man, thoſe who are his Inſtruments, thoſe who ſerve him, or whom he uſes to ſupplant or ſuppreſs others, and reach his owne ends by; Such may well be called the armes of mighty men, the armes of the men of the Earth. Evill men have their ſeconds or Inſtruments to doe evill. Upon this Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it was ſaid anciently;<note place="margin">An neſcis longas regibus eſſe inanus?</note> 
                     <hi>Doe not you know that Princes have long armes;</hi> the meaning is, they have Agents and Servants in the ſeverall parts of their Dominions, who are their hands or armes, both for protection of thoſe who are peaceable, and to take revenge upon the rebellious. Wee commonly ſay of a Servant that is diſcreet and faithfull, hee is his <hi>Maſters right hand.</hi> The mighty have many helpers, many armes and hands to carry on their deſignes, and to doe their wills.</p>
                  <q>As for the mighty man, or the man of armes, he had the Earth.</q>
                  <p>This ſtands in oppoſition to what was ſpoken before, the poore man could not get a drop of water, nor a cruſt of bread, but the mighty man he had the Earth; As if he had ſaid; <hi>O Job, thou being in power didſt paſſe away great poſſeſſions to the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, thou gaveſt both thy ſentence and aſſiſtance, that they ſhould have the Earth, but thou wouldeſt not helpe the poore ſo much as to a piece of bread, or a cup of water; The mighty man had the Earth;</hi> hee ſpeakes Indefinitely, as if all the Earth were his. Wicked men
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:153845:45"/> are called <hi>men of the Earth (Pſal.</hi> 10.18.) <hi>To judge the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and the oppreſſed, that the men of the Earth may no more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it may be objected, Is not every man a man of the Earth? As <hi>Adam the firſt man was of the Earth, Earthy;</hi> ſo all men are of the Earth, Earthy; why then is it then ſayd of a wicked man, that he is a man of the Earth, as if any man were of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pedigree or extraction?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer; A man of the Earth is put in oppoſition to a man of Heaven, to a man that hath his Eſtate, or hope, or portion in Heaven; the Saints have their Converſation in Heaven, and though they live upon the Earth, yet they are not men of the Earth; Carnall men are Earthly-minded, they minde the Earth, and thats both their hope and buiſines; they are not onely Earth in their Conſtitution, but Earth in their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, therefore they are called men of the Earth; theſe men had much of the Earth in their poſſeſſion, as well as they had all of it in their affections &amp; deſires. <hi>The mighty man he had the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve hence;
<q>That Evill Magiſtrates in Power are more ready to favour great men, then to releive poore men.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eliphaz</hi> knew that <hi>Job</hi> was a Magiſtrate, a man in Power, and he ſuppoſeth that under his government, the poore got no bread, but the mighty men had the Earth, they had favour to have and doe what they lift. It is very Common with the men of the world to be very free to thoſe that are of the world; they are like thoſe Clouds which we may obſerve ſometimes blowne over the dry Land, and emptying themſelves into the Sea. The mighty that had ſtore before, have more, and the poore, who had nothing, have nothing at all; Men love to beſtow kindneſſes upon them onely to whom they are like, or whom they love. A good man helps thoſe that are good, and wicked men care for none but ſuch as themſelves. Wicked men are called <hi>Oakes (Zech.</hi> 11.2.) <hi>Howle yee firr trees for the Cedar is fallen,</hi> (that is, the great man is fallen) <hi>becauſe all the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are ſpoyled; howle O yee Oakes of Baſhan, for the forreſt of the vintage is come downe.</hi> The Chaldee Paraphraſe ſaith, <hi>Howle yee Governors of Provinces:</hi> And hee calls theſe Governers, Oakes;

                     </note> they have nothing for the People of God, for thoſe that are the true objects of charity; they make their horſes fatt, their doggs fatt, none are leane but Gods poore.

Thus <hi>Eliphaz</hi> reproved <hi>Job,</hi> though indeed it was otherwiſe with him, as appeares in the defence which he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made for himſelfe againſt theſe groſſe inſinuations. And as to this particular he anſwers (<hi>Chap.</hi> 29.17.) <hi>I brake the Jawes of the wicked, and pluckt the ſpoyle from between his teeth;</hi> he indeed puld the earth from the mighty, or the mighty from the earth; though <hi>Eliphaz</hi> here ſayd, <hi>The mighty had the earth,</hi> and

                  <p>The word notes two things. Firſt, to <hi>continue,</hi> he dwelt there, thou let'ſt him abide, whereas if he had come into the Land thou ſhould'ſt quickly have rooted him out. Secondly, The word ſignifies not onely to dwell but to ſit, and to ſit, in Scripture Language notes authority or dominion, he <hi>dwelt or ſate in it,</hi> that is, hee was the man in authority, hee had the power, and the great places of government were entruſted in his hand.

                  <p>Favour ſhould be ſhewed according to the Juſtnes of mens cauſes, and not according to the greatneſſe of their perſons.

                     <hi>The mighty man hath the whole earth for his houſe to dwell in; the poore man lyes every where, but ſeldome dwels any where.</hi> The wicked are ſaid to have their portion in this life, they would have the Earth to themſelves, and they ſhall have nothing but Earth. So the Prophet deſcribes them (<hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay</hi> 5.8.) <hi>Woe unto them that joyne houſe to houſe, that lay field to field, that there may be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midſt of the Earth.</hi> Man is naturally a ſociable Creature, and it may ſeem ſtrange that he ſhould deſire to be alone in the midſt of the Earth: Therefore by his deſire to be alone, we muſt not
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:153845:47"/> underſtand a ſtrict lonenes, or ſolitarines, as if rich men had a minde to live alone, ſo as to have none about them or with them, but the meaning is, they would have none in power but themſelves, none in poſſeſſion but themſelves; they are unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that any ſhould have an eſtate but themſelves, they would have all others to be their underlings and tenants, their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and villaines to till their ground and gather in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venewes, they onely would be Freeholders, all others muſt hold by their Copy, and doe them homage. If the greateſt man in the world were turned alone into the world, he would have but an ill being of it, therefore the meaning of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is, that they would be placed alone in the midſt of the Earth to command and rule, all others muſt ſerve them. And they whoſe pride, ambition, or covetouſneſſe provokes them to dwell thus alone in the earth, ſhall finde nothing, beyond this earth, but fire to dwell in.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve this;
<q>That for a Magiſtrate to favour men becauſe of their greatneſſe and power, is an utter departure from his duty.</q>

                  <p>The poore man ſhould have the Earth, that belongs to him, as well as the rich. The meane mans right to his little is as good, as the mighty mans to his great deale. Juſtice gives e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man his owne, without reſpect to the Owner.</p>

                  <p>Then, Note;

And becauſe hee did not, here was <hi>Elies</hi> ſinne; and this is ſuggeſted as <hi>Jobs</hi> ſinne, Hee was a man in Power, yet he winked at thoſe violent ones, and let them carry all in the Earth, when as hee might have mended the matter, by checking their inſolencies, &amp; doing the poor right. This is charged on <hi>Thiatira</hi> in reference to the neglect of uſing their Church-power, (<hi>Revel.</hi> 2.20.) <hi>Notwithſtanding I have a few things againſt thee, becauſe thou ſuffereſt that woman Jezabell, that Cals her ſelfe a Propheteſs, to teach, and to ſeduce my Servants to commit fornication,</hi> &amp;c.

The more Power wee have to prevent or remove eyther Spirituall or civill Evills, the greater is our ſinne when it is not done: if <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had not ſuppoſed <hi>Job</hi> a Magiſtrate, hee could not have layd this burden upon him, or have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him in fault, becauſe the mighty man had the Earth, and the honourable man dwelt in it, oppreſſing the weake, and vexing thoſe of low degree.</p>

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:153845:49"/> as a poore empty man, having voluntarily made himſelfe of no reputation, though he were Lord over all. Such was the emptines, in which theſe widows were ſent away by <hi>Job,</hi> as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> accuſeth him. And this act may have a threefold interpretation. Firſt, they were ſent away <hi>empty;</hi> that is, not filled or releived by thy charity; thou didſt not open, eyther thy heart or thy hand to ſupply their neceſſities, or to make them up in what they wanted, and humbly deſired.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Thou haſt ſent widows empty away;</hi> That is, thou haſt given them no reliefe by thy Juſtice; ſome widows beg meerly for our Almes, others bring their caſe and cauſe to the Magiſtrate or man in Authority, for helpe againſt their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing adverſaries. In the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Luke,</hi> the importunate widow, ſaith to the Judge, <hi>Releive mee againſt my Adverſary;</hi> I beg not your charity, but your Juſtice; The widow is ſent away empty, when her ſuite is not heard. Wee may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>Eliphaz</hi> eyther way, that when the widow ſued for her right, ſhee found no Juſtice; and when ſhee came for an almes, ſhee found no charity.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Wee may interpret it yet higher; <hi>Thou hast ſent widows away empty;</hi> That is, widows came to thee full or in a good condition, but thou haſt emptyed them by oppreſſion, and taken away what they had. Covetous Magiſtrates care not how or of whom they get it, ſo they can get it; They empty the widows purſe, yea widows houſes to fill their owne.

                     </note> eyther by living upon them, or by taking away their livings. Wee may underſtand <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in this ſenſe alſo; <hi>Thou haſt ſent widows away empty;</hi> that is, wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows came to thee for protection, and thou didſt promiſe it, but then to make thy owne market upon them and ſerve thy ſelfe, thou haſt oppreſſed them, they came to thee to doe them right, and thou haſt undone them by unrighteouſneſſe. It is ill enough to deny widows charity, it is worſe to deny them Juſtice, but it is worſt of all to undoe them by unjuſtice; yet thoſe two Horſe-leaches, pride and covetouſneſs will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to draw from the widow. Some rich men undertake the widows cauſe, onely to enrich themſelves by the ſpoyles of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:153845:49"/> the widow; and for this reaſon they promiſe helpe to thoſe who are in miſery, that they may make them more miſerable, in ſtead of helping them, <hi>Thou haſt ſent widows away empty.</hi> Thus <hi>Job</hi> was ſuppoſed to have dealt with widows.</p>
                  <p>See next how <hi>Eliphaz</hi> chargeth him for his dealings with the fatherleſſe.</p>
                  <q>And the Armes of the fatherleſſe have been broken.</q>
                  <p>Theſe two deſolate names are often found alone,<note place="margin">Duo iſta nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na in quantum, deſpectui huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no in tantum miſerecordiae di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinae expoſita. <hi>Tertull. l. 1. ad uxor. c. 8.</hi> Per viduam &amp; pupillum omne genus miſeroru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hominum ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatur. <hi>Pined.</hi>

While the Prophet ſaith (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.3.) <hi>With thee the fatherleſs findeth mercy;</hi> Wee are not to ſtraighten his ſenſe onely to Orphans, but to any that are in diſtreſſe; hee that is a father may be called fatherleſſe, and the childe that hath a father may be called fatherleſſe, when extreamely needing the helpe eyther of God or man. And ſo the word <hi>widow</hi> muſt be underſtood (<hi>Rev.</hi> 18.7.) where <hi>Babylon</hi> boaſteth, <hi>I ſit as a Queene, and am no widow;</hi> that is, I am neither friendleſſe nor helpleſſe; or as the next words ſeeme to expound it; <hi>I ſhall ſee no ſorrow;</hi> which is uſually the widows portion.

                  <q>The armes of the fatherleſſe have been broken.</q>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:153845:50"/> even with thoſe crimes which his hand was farre from, and his heart further from, with thoſe crimes which he did not onely forbeare to practice, but which his ſoule did ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve;
<q>That the moſt innocent perſons, are often charged with the fouleſt and ſinfulleſt crimes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> was ſo cleare in his owne conſcience from this accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he not onely profeſſeth openly that he never did, but imprecates a like vengeance upon himſelfe if ever he had done it (<hi>Chap.</hi> 31.21.) <hi>If I have lift up my hands againſt the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe, when I ſaw my helpe in the gate,</hi> (that is, when by reaſon of my great power and authority in the place of judgement I could eaſily enough have done it, no man daring to oppoſe or hinder mee, but all rather being ready to countenance and aſſiſt me in it, if (I ſay) when I had theſe advantages over the fatherleſſe, I did ever breake their armes) <hi>then let mine arme fall from my ſhoulder blade, and mine arme be broken from the bone;</hi> As if he had ſaid, if I have done this thing, let a divine and viſible retaliation poynt me out for the man, let all the world ſee and reade my ſinne in my puniſhment, and my injuſtice againſt man in the moſt diſcernable judgements of God upon my ſelfe. Thus free and innocent was <hi>Job,</hi> and yet thus accuſed. And indeed if to accuſe were enough, there is no man in the world could be innocent or free. Who is there of ſo unſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a converſation, that may not be ſpotted with accuſation? who while his conſcience is pure, may not have much dirt caſt in his face?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> accuſes <hi>Job</hi> of all this, not becauſe he knew it to be ſo, but becauſe he thought it was ſo. Whence note (which hath formerly been toucht at)
<q>That to charge any man upon ſurmiſe with things that wee cannot prove, is a high breach not onely of charity but of juſtice.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lord</hi> reproves <hi>Jobs</hi> three friends in the laſt Chapter of this Booke, becauſe they <hi>had not ſpoken of him the thing that was right;</hi> and as they had not ſpoken the thing that was right of God, ſo not of <hi>Job.</hi> They pitcht upon no reaſon why they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:153845:51"/> condemned him ſo much, but onely becauſe he indured ſo much. They concluded him a man of ſinne, becauſe he was a man of ſorrow. The Apoſtle gives us the true genius of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3, 4.) <hi>Charity beleeveth all things;</hi> not that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is ſo credulous as to take up every thing for truth which is ſcattered by any common and ungrounded report; that's no commendation in any man, much leſſe is it the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a godly man; therefore when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Charity beleeveth all things,</hi> the meaning is, Charity interprets every thing in the beſt ſence which it will beare; and makes the fayreſt conſtruction which every mans caſe and condition will admit. And againe at the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe; <hi>Charity thinkes no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill;</hi> that is, it thinkes no evill of others; As a godly man will not maintaine evill thoughts, or ſuffer them to lodge within him, in reference to any ſinne which himſelfe is tempted to commit. So a charitable man, will not maintaine or Iodge evill thoughts of others, in reference to any ſinne which he can onely ſuppoſe that they have committed. Againe, as charity <hi>thinkes no evill,</hi> that is, it doth not plot evill againſt others; ſo thinkes no evill, by a raſh ſurmiſing it of others. Thus, <hi>charity beleeves all's well, and thinkes no evill.</hi> How uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then are they, yea, how unjuſt who beleeve all's ill, where they know of none, and thinke the worſt of them in whom they never ſaw any thing, but what was good? It is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for a man to ſay he doth not judge his brother malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, he ought not to judge him ignorantly. Though to ſpeake or judge ill of another, becauſe wee wiſh him ill, be the greater ſinne, yet barely to ſpeake or judge ill of another, by whom we know no ill, is very ſinfull: And then 'tis moſt ſinfull, when wee doe it not onely as not knowing any evill they have done, but becauſe we know, heare, or ſee the evills which they ſuffer. 'Tis dangerous as well as improper to make the hardeſt and harſheſt dealings of God with any man, the ground of our hard and harſh thoughts of him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider who they were whom <hi>Job</hi> is ſuppoſed to have oppreſſed; they were not the great ones, not the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men of the earth, but the fatherleſſe, and the widow.</p>
                  <p>Whence note;
<q>
                        <hi>That</hi> the poore are uſually the ſubject of oppreſſion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:153845:51"/>
                  <p>The greater fiſh in the ſea of this world devoure and live upon the leſſer; The ſtrong ſhould ſupport the weake, and they who are upper-moſt ſhould uphold thoſe who are under them. But becauſe the weake and the underlings may moſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be oppreſt, therefore they are moſt uſually oppreſt. As Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe is cruell, ſo 'tis cowardly, and dares not meddle with its match. God in reference to Spiritualls, <hi>filleth the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with good things, and the rich he ſendeth empty away,</hi> (Luk. 1.53.) Ungodly men, in reference to temporals, would ſend the rich away empty, if they could, but they are ſo farre from filling the hungry with good things, that they take away all the good things they can from the hungry, they care not if they ſtarve the hungry, if they make the poore poorer, and take all from them who have but little.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Job</hi> having been a Magiſtrate, and ſo (by his place) a Miniſter of Juſtice, is ſtrongly preſſed with the doing of injuſtice.</p>
                  <p>Whence note;
<q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That they who have power, may eaſily, though not alwayes juſtly, be ſuſpected for the abuſe of it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To have a power in our hands whereby we may doe good, is a temptation to doe evill. 'Tis hard to keepe power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in its bounds, and to rule that, by which others are ruled. The Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.10.) calls the rulers of <hi>Sion, rulers of Sodome,</hi> becauſe they ruled like them, or rather worſe then they, eating up the people, under their charge, rather then feeding them, and vexing thoſe whom they undertooke to governe, and to be a Shield unto againſt the vexations of others.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>That as oppreſſion is a ſinne in any man, ſo it is moſt ſinfull in thoſe who have power in their hands to releeve the oppreſſed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such act not onely contrary to a common rule, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their ſpeciall duty; by how much we have the more obligation not to doe a thing, by ſo much we ſin the more if we doe it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note;
<q>That as it is very ſinfull in Magiſtrates to wrong any man, ſo it is moſt ſinfull to wrong them, or to deny them right, who have moſt need of it, the widow, and the fatherleſſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:153845:52"/>
                  <p>Magiſtrates are called Gods; And God who hath honoured them by putting his name upon them, expects that they ſhould honour him, by imitating or acting like unto him. What a Magiſtrate doth he ſhould doe like God, he ſhould doe it ſo that every one may be convinced that God is in him and with him of a truth. As God takes care of the widow, and of the fatherleſſe, ſo ſhould he. God is knowne by this Title; <hi>A fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the fatherleſſe, and a Judge of the widow, is God in his holy habitation</hi> (Pſal. 68.5.) That is, in Heaven; for that's the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of his holines, and of his glory, there he dwells, <hi>Judging for the widow, and the fatherleſſe;</hi> And as that is the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall buſineſſe (as it were) of God in Heaven, ſo they who are Gods on earth, ought to make it their ſpeciall buſineſſe to judge for the widow and the fatherleſſe. Hence wee finde the widow and the fatherleſſe commended by name to the care of the Magiſtrate; The fatherleſſe have no naturall parents li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, or none neere of kinne remaining to maintaine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, therefore the Magiſtrate, who is <hi>(pater patriae)</hi> the common father of his Country, ſhould be their Foſter-Father. They who want power are the charge, &amp; ſhould be the ſpeciall care of thoſe in power. Thus they are commanded (<hi>Pſa.</hi> 82.3, 4.) <hi>Defend the poore &amp; fatherleſs, doe juſtice to the afflicted &amp; needy, deliver the poore and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.</hi> Here's their worke; and the neglect of this worke (how buſie ſo ever Magiſtrates are about other worke) is often complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of aloud in Scripture, as a crying ſinne, as a ſinne that ruines Nations, and drawes downe publicke Judgements up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a people. (<hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1.17.) <hi>Ceaſe to doe evill, learne to doe well, ſeeke Judgement, relieve the oppreſſed, Judge the fatherleſſe, plead for the widow:</hi> And at the 23 verſe; <hi>They judge not the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, neither doth the Cauſe of the widow come unto them.</hi> Againe (<hi>Jer.</hi> 5.28.) <hi>They judge not the Cauſe of the fatherleſſe.</hi> It is a ſin not to judge any mans Cauſe, not to judge the Cauſe of the richeſt, of the greateſt; yet it is more ſinfull not to judge the Cauſe of the widow and the fatherleſſe. And when he ſaith; <hi>They judge not the Cauſe,</hi> &amp;c. the meaning is, they judge not the Cauſe of the fatherleſſe impartially and righteouſly. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, he that doth not judge righteouſly, doth not judge at all; and when the Prophet ſaith, <hi>They judge not the Cauſe of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe,</hi>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:153845:52"/> it is as if he had ſaid; <hi>Among all the Cauſes that lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged, this is the Cauſe, that God takes moſt notice of, and is moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with the neglect of it, even when the Cauſe of the fatherleſſe is not pleaded, or judged.</hi> All are forward enough to plead the Cauſe of the rich; but when the Client is poore, and appeares <hi>(in forma pauperis)</hi> his cauſe ſeld me finds any but a poore and formal pleading. We read (<hi>Acts</hi> 6.1.) That <hi>there was a great murmuring of the Grecians againſt the Hebrew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> (Cha. 1.27.) ſummes up (as it were) all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion into this one duty; <hi>Pure religion and undefiled before God, and the Father is this, to viſit the fatherleſſe and the widow;</hi> Not as if this were indeed all religion, or the <hi>all</hi> of religion: but as when the Spirit in Scripture, hath to doe with prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or meere moral honeſt men, who place all religion in civill righteouſneſſe and workes of charity, then he calls them to firſt Table duties, or to the ſincere worſhip of God, ſo when the Spirit is ſpeaking to thoſe who place all their religion in worſhip, or in firſt Table duties, neglecting the duties of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and righteouſnes, then we finde all religion placed in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table worke, in giving every man his due, in compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the poore, in helping the helpleſſe, in feeding the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, in cloathing the naked, in comforting the ſorrowfull, and by name the fatherleſſe and the widow. <hi>This is pure religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to viſit the fatherleſſe and the widow;</hi> That is, this is the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall part, or the true practice of religion, without which all religion is vaine; Therefore when the Apoſtle had ſayd (<hi>v</hi> 21.) <hi>Receive with meeknes the engraffed word:</hi> Leſt any man ſhould ſtay there, and think he had done enough when he had been a bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he adds, <hi>Be doers of the word;</hi> That is, looke to the practicall part of religion, be diligent in the duties of love to men, as wel as in thoſe of the worſhip of God.</p>
                  <p>Take theſe two inferences from the whole verſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Seeing God taketh ſo much care of the widow and the fatherleſſe, <hi>Let the widow, let the fatherleſſe truſt in God.</hi> They who receive peculiar promiſes from God, ſhould put forth ſuitable acts of faith towards God. Faith cannot worke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:153845:53"/> a word, and where it hath a word it ought to worke. Wee have both put together in the preſent caſe (<hi>Jer.</hi> 49.11.) <hi>Leave thy fatherleſſe children I will preſerve them alive, and let the widows truſt in mee:</hi> As if God had ſayd, if none will take care of them, I will, I will take care of them, I will be a father of the fatherleſſe, a husband to the widow, leave that care to me. Therefore let the widow and fatherleſſe truſt in God; A word from God is a better &amp; a bigger portion, then all the wealth of this world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Seeing the Lord is ſo jealous over them, and ſo ready to take their part againſt all their adverſaries, this ſhould provoke them to be full of zeale for God; God ſtands up for their protection, therfore they ſhould ſtand up for God their protector and patron. How carefull ſhould they be to pleaſe him, who is ſo watchfull to preſerve them? Speciall promiſes call for ſpeciall obedience, as well as for ſpeciall faith; The more God engageth himſelfe to doe for us, the more ſhould we engage our ſelves (in his ſtrength) to doe for him; <hi>None have more reaſon to be rich in faith and love to God, then the poore and fatherleſſe.</hi>

                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:153845:54"/>
                  <p>But I rather take the words as wee render them to expreſſe the ſad effects and fruits of his ſinne; As if <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had ſaid; <hi>Becauſe thou haſt taken a Pledge of thy brother for nought,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt ſent widows away empty, and the armes of the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe have been broken,</hi> therefore <hi>ſnares are round about thee,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>Firſt, To the beſiedging of a City, ſnares are round about thee,<note place="margin">Hoſtile aliquid &amp; obſidionale ſignificat.</note> thou art now hemde in on every ſide with-troubles; as Chriſt threatens <hi>Jeruſalem; Thine enemies ſhall caſt a trench about thee,</hi> &amp;c. A trench is but a great ſnare to catch men, as men catch birds and vermine in ſnares. Or</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Alluſion may be to Impriſonment, thou art compaſſed with ſtrong walles, and ſhut in with gates, thou art ſhackel'd with iron ſnares.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The words may allude to hunting and fowling, in ſuch diſports nets and ſnares are ſet to take the intended game. Snares are often ſpoken of in Scripture, to intimate or ſet forth the afflictions and ſorrowes that entrap and hold the ſons of men. So that to ſay, <hi>Snares are round about thee,</hi> is no more but thus, troubles are round about thee; and theſe ſnares are ſometimes ſet by the hand of man, ſometimes by the immediate hand of God. Good things are often made a ſnare to the undoing of evill men, and evill things are often made a ſnare to the troubling, though not to the undoing of good men. But I ſhall not proſecute this alluſion, having ſpoken of it at the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap: <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 8. where <hi>Job</hi> complaines that God had taken him in his ſnare; as alſo in the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter at the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe.</p>
                  <q>And ſudden feare troubleth thee.</q>
                  <p>Wee may underſtand this feare; firſt, for the paſſion of feare, or for feare within: Secondly, for the occaſion of feare, which is feare without. <hi>Sudden feare troubleth thee,</hi> that is, the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or apprehenſion of ſome terrible thing cauſeth thee to feare.<note place="margin">Paſſio pro ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecto &amp; mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria ſuni in omni idiomate fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liare. <hi>Sanct.</hi>
                     </note> Feare is often put in Scripture for the thing feared, for the object of feare, or for that which cauſeth feare. Thus alſo hope is put for the thing hoped for, and <hi>viſion</hi> for the thing ſeene, or the object of the viſion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Some expound feare in the Text, for that ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:153845:54"/> feare which riſeth from guilt, or for terror of conſcience. <hi>Sudden feare troubleth thee;</hi> That is, thy conſcience flyes in thy face and affrights thee; thy feare flows not from any outward troubles that threaten thee, or from wants that afflict thee, but from thoſe wickedneſſes which have been committed by thee; thy conſcience vexeth and tormenteth thee, not onely with feare, but with ſudden feare; feare ruſheth upon thee unexpectedly, violently, like an armed man. <hi>Sudden feare trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth thee.</hi> Taking feare in all or any one of theſe interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>Sudden feare ſurprizeth ſecureſt ſinners.</q>
                  <p>When they ſhall ſay peace and quietneſſe, then ſorrow and anguiſh come upon them as paine upon a woman in travell, and they ſhall not eſcape. The Prophet in viſion (<hi>Zech.</hi> 5.1.) <hi>Saw a flying roll;</hi> That flying roll was the Curſe; And it was called <hi>a flying roll,</hi> to note the ſpeedy and ſudden coming of thoſe judgements that were written in it; They came not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the ſpurre, but upon the winge. They came flying; Flying is a ſwift motion, and that motion is applyd to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when once God giveth it a Commiſſion to come. Hence alſo (<hi>Deut.</hi> 32.41.) the ſword is called a lightning ſword, or a ſword that hath lightning in it; <hi>If I</hi> (ſayth the Lord) <hi>whet my glittering</hi> (or lightning) <hi>ſword.</hi> The ſword of the Lord is as Lightning; it hath burning and ſwiftneſs in it; divine vengeance cometh as Lightning. It is called alſo the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing ſcourge (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.15.) 'Tis a ſcourge becauſe the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes of it cauſe much ſmar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Againe, This ſuddennes of feare, or of things feared, may have reference unto the ſecurity of wicked men, who though they have often heard of dangers, and judgements have been threatned upon them, yet they alwayes come ſuddenly upon them, becauſe they never prepare for them. To ſuch as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared, evills are alwayes ſudden, how often ſoever they have been warned of them. As to him that is prepared, death is never ſudden, though he dye (as we vulgarly phraſe it) a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:153845:55"/> death. So he that is unprepared for death, dyeth ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though he dye that which wee commonly call a lingring death. Thus death and judgement ſhall come ſuddenly upon all ungodly men. <hi>It ſhall be</hi> (ſayth Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.37.) <hi>as in the dayes of Noah, they were eating and drinking, they were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, and giving in marriage, till the day that Noah entred into the Arke, and knew not till the floud came, and tooke them all away.</hi> But did they not know of the floud, till the floud came; aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly they did, for <hi>Noah</hi> foretold them of and preached the coming of the floud, a hundred and twenty yeares before it came. (<hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3.) <hi>My ſpirit ſhall not alwayes ſtrive (I will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be contending) yet his dayes ſhall be an hundred and twenty yeares;</hi> That is, he ſhall have an hundred and twenty yeares warning, all that time the old world had warning of the flould, and <hi>Noah</hi> preached upon that Text all that time; yet the floud came upon them (ſaith the Text) and <hi>they knew it not;</hi> that is, they regarded not what <hi>Noah</hi> ſaid; they tooke no thought neyther to prevent the floud, nor to prepare for it. The Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tels us, that <hi>Noah by faith being war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God of things not ſeen as yet, moved with feare, prepared an Ark to the ſaving of his houſe, by which he condemned the world</hi> (that is, the then world, of unbeleefe and hardnes of heart) <hi>and became heyre of the righteouſneſſe which is by faith</hi> (Heb. 11.7.) Hee had a holy feare in him, and a faith alſo; a faith that the thing ſhould be done, and a feare of God who threatned to doe that thing. <hi>Thus by faith being moved with feare, he prepared an Arke for the ſafety of himſelfe and of his houſehold.</hi> Why did not the reſt alſo make preparation? they did not beleeve, nor did they feare. Chriſt rebuked hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Whenſoever the Lord of ſuch ſervants ſhall come, he cometh in a day, when they looke not for him, and in an houre that they are not aware of</hi> (Matth. 24.50.) that is, he cometh ſuddenly. What can come more ſuddenly upon any man, then that which he looked not for, nor was at all aware of. Thus he ſhall come <hi>to cut them aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

By prophecying or ſpeaking to them in the Name of the Lord. The proper worke of the Word is to open the eyes, and enlighten the minde. But when a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have long ſhut their owne eyes againſt, or onely dallyed with (that tranſcendent mercy) the light, then God (which is the ſevereſt judgement) ſhuts their eyes, and darkens them with light.

                  <p>Secondly, Darkneſs taken improperly is Externall, ſo a ſtate of ſorrow and affliction, is a ſtate of darkneſs. As before <hi>ſnares,</hi> ſo here <hi>darkneſs,</hi> notes any troubleſome condition, or the trouble of any mans condition. And when to darkneſs, this is added, <hi>Darkneſs, that thou canſt not ſee,</hi> it may import the greateſt degree of darkneſs, even darkneſs in perfection, or as the Scripture ſpeaks, <hi>thick darkneſs,</hi> yea, <hi>outer darkneſs.</hi> There is a darknes in which wee may ſee, a darknes which hath ſome kinde of light in it, but when darknes is ſo thicke that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee, that is, that we cannot ſee any thing in it, (as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſay of extreame darkneſs, 'tis ſo darke, that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee his hand) then 'tis perfect darkneſs.

So the word is tranſlated (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.17.) <hi>A Watchman from the Tower ſayd, I ſee a company.</hi> And that was <hi>Jehu</hi> with his troopes, who came marching furiouſly with the revenge of God in his hand upon the houſe of <hi>Ahab.</hi> And ſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 26.10. <hi>By reaſon of the abundance of their horſes, their duſt ſhall cover thee; thy walls ſhall ſhake at the noyſe of the Horſemen, and of the Wheeles, and of the Chariots.</hi> Reade the ſame uſe of the word (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.6.) <hi>The multitude</hi> (ſome read the inundation) <hi>of Camels ſhall cover thee;</hi> They ſhall come in ſuch abundance, that they ſhall come like a floud, and ſhall be as the gathering of many waters. Troopes of Horſes and Camels ruſh together as many waters; And wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ruſh and throng together, even as many horſes. Thus, here abundance, or an Army of waters come in upon thee and cover thee. Waters in Scripture frequently ſignifie afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.2.) <hi>When thou paſſest thorow the waters</hi> (that is, thorow great afflictions) <hi>I will be with thee.</hi> (Pſal. 18.16.) <hi>Hee drew me out of many waters;</hi> That is, out of many afflictions. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.12.) <hi>Wee went through fire and water, but thou brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt us forth into a wealthy place.</hi> Fire and water, note all ſorts of afflictions, hot and cold, moyſt and dry. And ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that water in a metaphoricall ſence is ſo often uſed in Scripture to ſignifie affliction; becauſe water in a proper ſence
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:153845:57"/> did once afflict the whole world. As the generall Judgement upon the world at the laſt day ſhall be by fire, ſo the firſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Judgement upon the world, was by water; it was a floud of waters, by which the Lord deſtroyed the old world. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoſt of <hi>Aegyptians</hi> (which was the ſecond moſt Eminent Judgement, that ever was in the world) were overwhelmed by the waters of the red Sea. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> ſang (<hi>Exo.</hi> 15.4, 5.) <hi>Pharaohs Chariot &amp; his hoſt hath he caſt into the Sea, his choſen Captaines alſo are drowned in the red Sea; The depths have covered them, they ſanke into the bottome as a ſtone.</hi> And againe, (<hi>v.</hi> 10.) <hi>The Sea covered them, they ſanke as Lead in the mighty waters.</hi> Water being the Element and the Inſtrument, which God hath ſo often uſed in his angry diſpenſations towards ſinfull men, it may emphatically expreſſe any diſpenſation of his anger. Yet if we conſider the very nature of the thing it ſelfe, it carrieth ſignificancy enough to be the Embleme of ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and ſoareſt affliction.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There is in water a ſwallowing power; as water is eaſily ſwallowed, ſo it ſwallowes all up. Man cannot ſubſiſt in it when it is moſt peaceable, and he can hardly eſcape out of it when 'tis enraged. Sorrow and affliction are ſwallowers alſo; unleſſe mercy appeare and moderate them, they drowne and overthrow all. The Apoſtle uſeth that expreſſion when he adviſeth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (2 <hi>Ep:</hi> 2.7.) <hi>To forgive and comfort the inceſtuous perſon,</hi> whom, according to his advice, they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Excommunicated or caſt out from fellowſhip in the Church; <hi>Leſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſuch a one ſhould be ſwallowed up with over-much ſorrow.</hi> Sorrow of any ſort, even ſorrow for ſinne may poſſibly have an exceſſe, or an over-muchnes in it; and when ever it hath ſo (beyond the end for which it ſerves, for ſorrow is not of any worth in it ſelfe, but as it ſerves to a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall end, When (I ſay) ſorrow hath ſuch an exceſſe, then) not onely the comforts, but the gifts and uſefullnes of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſorrowing, are in danger to be ſwallowed up by it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Water doth not onely ſwallow up, but enter in; while it covereth the body, it fills the bowells. Thus afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on like water, fills within as well as covers without. <hi>David</hi> complaines that his affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ctions did ſo (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.1.) <hi>Save</hi> me <hi>O God, for the waters are come in unto my ſoule.</hi> Not onely have
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:153845:57"/> theſe waters ſweld over mee, but they are ſoakt into mee. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or ſoule-afflictions, as well as outward, and bodyly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, are ſet forth by waters. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.18.) <hi>As he cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed himſelfe with curſing, like as with his garment, ſo let it come into his bowells (or within him) like water, and like oyle into his bones.</hi> Liquids penetrate, ſo doe afflictions.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As the water is not mans proper Element, hee lives and breathe in the ayre, not in the water; So affliction is not our proper Element, though it be due to our ſinne, yet it is not proper to our nature. Man was not made to live in affliction, as the fiſh was made to live in the water; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as it is ſaid; <hi>The Lord doth not willingly afflict nor grieve the Children of men, (Lam.</hi> 3.33.) 'Tis (as it were) beſides the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, when he afflicts the children of men. So it is ſayd (<hi>Heb.</hi> 12.11.) <hi>No chaſtning for the preſent ſeemeth to be joyous, but grievous.</hi> Man is out of his Element when he is under chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. Hee was made at firſt to live in the light of Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, in the ſmiles and embraces of divine love. As man is out of his way when he ſins, ſo he is off from his end when he ſuffers; He was not deſigned for the overwhelming choaking waters of ſorrow and judgement, but for the ſweete refreſhing ayre of joy and mercy. It often proves a mercy in the event to be covered with theſe waters; To be covered with them, that we may be waſhed by them is a mercy, but onely to be cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with them, eſpecially (as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> here ſaith <hi>Job</hi> was) to be deeply covered with them, is a deepe and ſoare affliction. <hi>Abundance of waters cover thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>That as God hath treaſures of mercy, and abounds in goodneſs, ſo hee hath treaſures of affliction, and abundance of wrath.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As God hath abundance of waters ſealed up in the Clouds, as in a treaſury, and hee can unlocke his treaſury and let them out whenſoever he pleaſeth, eyther to refreſh or overflow the Earth; ſo hee hath abundance of afflictions, and hee can let them forth, as out of a treaſury, when he pleaſeth. And as wee read (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.) that the waters of the Sanctuary, thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waters were of ſeveral degrees; firſt, to the Ankles, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the knees, then to the Loines, and then a river that could
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:153845:58"/> not be paſſed over, abundance of waters. Thus alſo the bitter waters, the waters of affliction are of ſeverall degrees: ſome waters of afflictions are but Ancle-deepe, they onely make us a little wet-ſhod, there are other waters up to the knees; and others to the Loynes, and others wee may rightly call abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of waters, a Sea of waters; <hi>I am come into deepe waters</hi> (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 69.2.) or <hi>into depth of waters, where the floods overflow mee;</hi> And having ſayd (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.6.) <hi>O my God, my ſoule is caſt downe within mee;</hi> He adds in the next words (<hi>v.</hi> 7.) <hi>Deepe calleth unto deepe at the noyſe of thy water-ſpouts: All thy waves and thy billowes are gone over me.</hi> Where, by deepe to deepe, by waterſpouts, by waves and billowes, he elegantly ſets forth his diſtreſſe, in alluſion to a Ship at Sea in a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtorme and ſtreſſe of weather; when the ſame wave upon whoſe back the veſſel rides out of one deep, plungeth it downe into another; Thus the afflicted are toſſed and overwhelmed in a Sea of trouble, till they are at their wits end, if not at their faiths end.</p>
                  <p>Take two or three Deductions from all theſe words layd together. Wee ſee, by how many metaphors, the ſorrows of this life are ſet forth, even by <hi>ſnares, and feares, and darknes, and waters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That as God hath abundance of afflictions in his power, ſo hee hath variety of wayes and meanes to afflict the ſonnes of men; eyther for the puniſhment of their ſinne, or for the tryall of their graces.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If one will not doe it another ſhall; if the ſnare will not, feare ſhall, if feare will not, darknes ſhall; and if darknes will not, the waters ſhall, and if waters of one hight will not doe it, hee will have waters deepe enough to doe it; abundance of waters ſhall doe it; hee hath variety of wayes to deale both with ſinners and with Saints</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider the inference which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> makes, <hi>Therefore ſnares</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are upon thee;</hi> That Is, becauſe thou haſt done wickedly in not releeving and in oppreſſing the poore, <hi>therefore</hi> ſnares have entangled thee. This (though falſe in <hi>Jobs</hi> particular caſe, yet) is a truth in General. And it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:153845:58"/> us, That, <hi>There is an unavoydable ſequell between ſinne and ſorrow.</hi> Looke upon ſinne in its owne nature, and ſo the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quell is unavoydable, ſinne is bigge with ſorrow; as affliction burdens the ſinner, ſo ſinne is burdend with affliction. Sinne hath all ſorts of affliction in its bowells; and wee may ſay of all the evills that afflict us, <hi>they are our ſinnes.</hi> Sinne is formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the tranſgreſſion of the Law, and ſinne is virtually the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of tranſgreſſors. Many (I grant) are afflicted for tryall of their graces (as hath been ſhewed before) but grace had never been thus tryed if man had not ſinned. Sinne is the remote cauſe of all afflictions, and it is the next or immediate procuring cauſe of moſt afflictions. Would any man avoyde the ſnare, let him feare to ſinne; would he avoyd feare, let him feare to doe evill; would he keepe out of darkneſs, and not be covered with abundance of waters, let him take heed hee drinke not iniquity like water, let him have no fellowſhip with the unfruitfull workes of darkneſs. God tells the ſinner plainely what portion he is to expect; <hi>Say woe to the wicked, it ſhall be ill with him; for the reward of his hands ſhall be given him, (Iſa.</hi> 3.11.) Wee may as well hope to avoyd burning when we run into the fire, or dirtying when we run into the mire, as to eſcape ſmarting when we run into ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Yet more diſtinctly, wee may conſider all thoſe evills com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under thoſe words in the Text, <hi>Snares, darknes,</hi> &amp;c. eyther in reference to wicked men, or to the Saints. Snares and darknes upon the wicked, are the iſſues of divine wrath. While theſe ſad diſpenſations are ſent out and meete with Saints, they are the iſſues of divine love. For though a godly man may provoke God to anger, and finde by many evidences that God (as to his actings) is angry with him, yet as to his perſon he alwayes loves him. And therefore (as a wicked mans Table is made his ſnare, ſo) he is aſſured that his ſnare ſhall be made to him a Table, that his darkneſs ſhall worke light, his evills good to him. He is alſo aſſured that the Lord will d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him out of theſe ſnares, and cut the coards of the wicked. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 129.4.) That hee will deliver him from feare, from darknes, and bring him up out of the abundance of waters which cover him, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.6.) <hi>For this</hi> (that is, becauſe thou art ſo gracious) <hi>ſhall every one that is godly pray
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:153845:59"/> unto thee in a time when thou mayſt be found</hi> (The Hebrew is, <hi>in a finding time,</hi> which according to our tranſlation, notes the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon when God may be found, as the Prophet ſpeaks (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.6.) Yet it may be well expounded for the time when trouble finds, that is, takes hold of the godly man. And ſo the word is uſed (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.3.) <hi>The paines of hell gat hold of me</hi> (we put in the Margin) <hi>found me.</hi> In which ſence the word is uſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.8. <hi>Thine hand ſhall finde out,</hi> (that is, take hold of, and apprehend) <hi>all thine enemies, thy right hand ſhall finde out thoſe that hate thee.</hi> Now in <hi>this finding time,</hi> eyther when God may be found, or when trouble finds a godly man, he (ſetting himſelfe to pray) hath this promiſe, <hi>ſurely in the floods of great waters, they</hi> (that is, the floods of great waters, by which are meant, great dangers) <hi>ſhall not come nigh him,</hi> (that is, the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man) to hurt or drowne him. Sometimes prayer keeps the flood off, and alwayes prayer delivers the Godly man out of the flood. Wicked men have no minde to come nigh God with their hearts (and ſo ſome enterpret the latter part of this verſe in the Pſalme) nor will God admitt them nigh unto himſelfe, in the floods of great waters. And the floods of great waters ſhall not (which is the ſcope of our reading) come nigh the Godly man for his hurt, when he drawes nigh to God in prayer with his heart.</p>
                  <p>Thus wee have ſeene the ſinnes of <hi>Job</hi> drawne out into a Charge, and the Judgement of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> upon it, what the event, the ſequell, or Iſſue of thoſe ſinnes, was <hi>ſnares and feares, and waters and darkneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is yet one thing further, that I ſhall here take notice of from the conſtant courſe of <hi>Jobs</hi> friends in dealing with him. Wee ſee that ſtill they charge him with ſinne, and ſtill inſiſt upon it, that all his afflictions &amp; miſeries were the fruits of his ſinne. <hi>Job</hi> (as hath appeared in opening ſeverall paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of this Booke) hath as often diſproved their inference, and denied that his ſufferings were cauſed by his ſinne, at leaſt not by any ſuch way of ſinning, as they charged him with. Labouring alſo much to enforme them that God hath many other reaſons why he afflicts his people, and that God might take libertie to afflict him, though he were no ſuch kinde of creature as they rendred him; yet notwithſtanding all hee
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:153845:59"/> could ſay, eyther to purge himſelfe or better conforme them, they perſevered in the ſame opinion, both concerning his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the cauſe of his afflictions.</p>
                  <p>Whence Note;
<q>It is hard to convince thoſe who are under a miſtake, whether about perſons, or doctrines.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Error is as binding upon the conſcience, and as ſtrongly embraced by the affections, as truth is; For it binds and is embraced, not in the name of an error, but in the name of truth. And men are therefore wedded to, and in love with their owne conceptions, becauſe (how monſtrous and hard-favoured ſoever in themſelves, yet) nothing is more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in their eye then they. <hi>No man</hi> (fayth the Apoſtle) <hi>ever hated his owne fleſh, but loved and cheriſhed it.</hi> The fleſh of our minds (ſuch are all falſe principles and poſitions) is more loved and cheriſhed by us, then the fleſh of our bodies. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, when men have once taken up an opinion, they thinke it a diſhonour to lay it downe againe. 'Tis rare to finde a man that will yeeld up his Judgement, though it be a miſguided one, or acknowledge that he is in an error, though he begins to take ſome knowledge, or at leaſt ſome ſuſpition of it. A light intimation or onely the Appearance of a probability will amount to a proofe againſt eyther perſons or doctrines which we like not; but the cleareſt demonſtrations will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſe a Jealouſie againſt what we like. Let <hi>Job</hi> ſay what he will in his owne caſe, he cannot be beleeved by his friends, and his friends will ſay againe what once they had ſayd, though it had been more then once before fully anſwered. The preſent age hath given us ſad experiences of this thing. For, as many have been unſtable and toſſed to and fro with every winde of (falſe) doctrine, ſo others have been ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne and unmoved from their errors, though the ſtrongeſt winds of truth have breathed, yea blowne hard upon them. And thoſe prejudices which have (with ſo much ſeverity) been taken up by brethren againſt brethren; how doe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, in many minds, as mountaines, unmoved to this very day?</p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:153845:60"/>
                  <p>I know not which is worſe, unſetlednes in the truth, and an eaſineſs to let it goe, or tenaciouſneſſe in an error, and a hardnes to let it goe. Nor doe I well know which is worſe, a readineſs to take up hard thoughts of our brethren, or an un-readines to lay them downe. Were the lawes of love to man, and zeale for God obſerved, theſe extreames would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be avoyded. Pure zeale for God would fixe us in the truth, and make us more eaſie to be brought off from our moſt applauded errors. True love to man, would cauſe us to examine every ground of ſuſpicion againſt a brother twice, before we doe indeed ſuſpect him once; And it would cauſe us to rejoyce in any appearance of his innocence, whereby we might diſcharge our owne Spirits of all ſuſpicions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him. Our <hi>love</hi> (as the Apoſtle prayes, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.9.) <hi>ought to abound in knowledge and in all Judgement.</hi> That is, wee ought to love Judiciouſly as well as affectionately or ſincerely. So that, true love will not over-looke the faults of another, nor will it approve againſt light. Yet true love is ready to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine any light offered, that grounds of ſuſpition may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and we reſtored to a right underſtanding of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:153845:61"/> a covering to him that he ſeeth not,</hi> that's the firſt proofe: and then we have a ſecond, in the latter end of that verſe, God hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things to doe then to minde what is done here, he hath higher buſineſſes and imployments then to look upon us who are creeping upon mole-hills, and engaged about a heape of earth; for, <hi>he walketh in the circuit of heaven;</hi> that is, there lieth his great worke, he hath enough in a nobler Spheare to imploy himſelfe in; and therefore ſurely, thou thinkeſt, that God takes no care at all, or not ſuch ſpeciall care about the affayres and wayes of men. This is the ſumme and ſcope of theſe three verſes. They are a new charge of impiety upon <hi>Job,</hi> as ſhutting up or reſtraining the providence of God to the things of heaven alone; and we ſee how <hi>Eliphaz</hi> frames argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and proofes of the point for <hi>Job,</hi> which (as will appeare afterwards) never came into his heart.</p>
               <p>Now though <hi>Eliphaz</hi> miſapplyed all this to <hi>Job,</hi> yet here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he fully characters &amp; clearly paints out the ſpirit of carnal men, for ſuch ſecure themſelves in their evill wayes upon this preſumption, that God takes no notice of them, or that he hath ſomething elſe to do then to trouble himſelfe with what they are doing.</p>

                     </note>There are divers readings of theſe words; firſt, thus; <hi>Is not God higher then the heavens?</hi> A ſecond thus; <hi>Doth not God poſſeſſe the high heaven?</hi> The Originall may ſtrictly be renderd; <hi>God the height of heaven;</hi> that is, <hi>God is above all heavens:</hi> we render well; <hi>God is in the height</hi> or <hi>ſublimitie of heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Queſtion; <hi>Is not God in the height of heaven?</hi> is taken three wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some read it as an Exhortation given by <hi>Eliphaz</hi> to <hi>Job,</hi> to draw off the motion of his thoughts, &amp; moſt of all the ſetled bent of his heart from thoſe inferior things, his loſſes &amp; troubles, his ſorrows, paines, and ſickneſſes; he would divert his minde from theſe worldly ſorrows, and raiſe it up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly enjoyments, <hi>Is not God in heaven?</hi> As if he had ſayd, <hi>Why ſtandeſt thou poring upon things below?

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:153845:61"/> way to eaſe our minds of all the troubles and ſorrowes which we meete with in this world; could we but aſcend in Spirit to the height where God is, could we by an eye of faith looke to him, live upon him, and in him, all burdens would be light, and preſſures eaſie to us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This queſtion may be taken as a plaine aſſertion or affirmation, and it is of the ſame value &amp; ſignification with this, <hi>God is in the height of heaven, there he is, and from thence he beholds all the children of men, their wayes and workes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Is not God in the height of heaven?</hi> May be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not as the queſtion of <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> and ſo his affirmation, but as the queſtion of <hi>Job,</hi> and ſo his ſuppoſition. As if <hi>Eliphaz</hi> apprehended <hi>Job</hi> thus ſpeaking in his heart;<note place="margin">Annon deus eſt (inquis) in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudine coeli? <hi>Jun.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Is not God</hi> (ſayeſt thou) <hi>in the height of heaven?</hi> or, doeſt not thou, O <hi>Job,</hi> ſay thus; <hi>God is in the height of heaven;</hi> I grant that he is there, but I deny that he is there in thy ſence, or according to thy opinion. He is not concluded, or ſhut up there, he is not ſo in the height of heaven, but that he mindeth what is done upon the earth, yea in the very depths of hell. As if he had ſayd; <hi>Thy thoughts and conceptions of God are too ſtrait and narrow; Thou ſpeakeſt much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low God, while thou ſayeſt he is in the hight of heaven. While thou confineſt God to heaven, thou makeſt him like thy ſelfe on earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From theſe words in the two former Expoſitions, Obſerve;
<q>That the hight of heaven, or heaven above, is the place of Gods ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall reſidence.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Heaven is my throne</hi> (ſayth the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.1.) the throne is the ſeate of a Prince, there he declares his power, and his ſtate; his glory ſhines from his throne. A Prince looks like a common man when he is abroad in the world, but when up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his throne, then the rayes of Majeſty break forth, and he appeares as he is. Thus the holy Prophet begs a gratious look of the Lord from heaven (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.15.) <hi>Looke downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the habitation of thy holineſſe, and of thy glory.</hi> Heaven is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the habitation of Gods holineſſe, and of his glory, becauſe his holineſſe and glory ſhine forth more in heaven, then upon the earth; little of the holineſſe of God is diſcovered to us here, though ſo much of it breaks forth here as cauſeth the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:153845:62"/> heart of carnal men to quarrell with it continually. Nor are any able with theſe eyes, or rather with theſe hearts to beare the glory of God, or endure his holines. When but ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary glimpſes of theſe appeared to <hi>Eſayah,</hi> he cryed out, <hi>Wo is me, I am undone</hi> (or <hi>cut off) becauſe I am a man of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane lips, and I dwell in the midſt of a people of uncleane lips, for mine eyes have ſeene the King, the Lord of H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſts,</hi> (Iſa. 6.5.) As God is of purer eyes then to behold iniquity, ſo man is of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purer eyes then to behold the glory and holineſs of God in cleare manifeſtations of it, and therefore heaven is the ſeate, the habitation of his holineſſe, and of his glory. Hence we may take two further inferences.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That <hi>our hearts, and our eyes ſhould be lifted upwards;</hi> the whole currunt of Scripture ſpeaks of God as above in heaven. And that's the reaſon why the Apoſtle (<hi>Col.</hi> 3.1.) exhorts, <hi>Sett you affections on things above, and not on things here below;</hi> And as on things above, ſo moſt of all upon God who is above.<note place="margin">Surſum corda.</note> The old word was, <hi>Lift up your hearts;</hi> and <hi>David</hi> ſayth in prayer, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.1.) <hi>I lift up my ſoule to thee.</hi> And againe, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 123.1.) <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwelleſt in the heavens.</hi> Yea our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe when he prayed (<hi>Joh.</hi> 17.1.) <hi>Lift up his eyes to heaven, and ſaid, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the houre is come, glorifie thy Sonne,</hi> &amp;c. The eye lift up to heaven is a ſigne of the heart lift up to heaven, and that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall viſible action, ſerves to fix our moſt ſpirituall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the inviſible God. 'Tis indeed an eaſie thing to lift the eyes up to heaven, but it is very hard, yea impoſſible, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a divine aſſiſtance to lift up the heart to heaven; the heart of a prophane worldling mudds ſo much in the earth, that he ſeldome lifts up ſo much as his eyes to heaven; and how much or how often ſoever a hypocrite lifts up his eyes to heaven, yet ſtill his heart muds in the earth. The eye lookes upward naturally, but if ever the heart looke upward, 'tis a worke of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Then <hi>ſerve the Lord with reverence and holy feare, in in all your addreſſes to him, and appearings before him.</hi> Wee reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence thoſe who are on high on earth, and ſhall wee not reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence him who is higher then the higheſt? him who is in the hight of heaven? While Chriſt bids us ſay, <hi>Our Father which art
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:153845:62"/> in heaven,</hi> he teacheth us, as to pray with confidence, becauſe God is our father, ſo to pray with reverence, becauſe he is a father in heaven, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 6.9.) The Preacher (<hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.2.) makes this an argument why wee ſhould be taken up in high thoughts of God, why we ſhould ſpeak in a reverentiall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner both of him, and to him; <hi>Be not raſh with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be haſty to utter any thing before God.</hi> He puts (as it were) a double bridle upon man in his drawing neere to God; firſt, upon his mouth, <hi>Let not thy mouth be raſh;</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, upon his heart (for the heart will talke at random as well as the mouth, yea the heart will talke more at random then the mouth can; and there is praying with the heart alone as well as with the heart and mouth together, therefore ſayth he) <hi>Let not thy heart be haſty to utter any thing before God;</hi> Why? <hi>for God is in heaven, and thou art upon the earth, therefore let thy words be few.</hi> Here are indeed two arguments to enforce this compoſure of ſpirit; firſt, the highnes and Greatnes of God; ſecondly, the lownes and vilenes of man. Conſider God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and thou art below, not onely in regard of place, but of ſtate and dignitie, of power and majeſty. The being of God in heaven, notes not onely a power of ſoveraignty to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us, but a power of ability both to puniſh and to provide for us, to puniſh our raſhnes, and to ſupply all our wants wherewith we acquaint him, and humbly mention before him; therefore <hi>Be not raſh with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be haſty,</hi> &amp;c. The ſame <hi>Solomon</hi> in the ſame booke, allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally deſcribing the declined decrepid condition of man, ſaith of the old man, that he is <hi>afraid of that which is high (Eccl.</hi> 12.5.) Young men will be clambering and aſcending, but old men are <hi>afraid of that which is high,</hi> they dare not goe up a high ſteepe place, leaſt their ſtrength or breath ſhould fayle, or leaſt their braine ſhould turne, and they through giddines tumble downe. Old men love to keepe upon levell or even ground, and are afraid of that which is high. Surely both young and old, have reaſon to be afraid of <hi>him that is high,</hi> to have reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentiall thoughts of God, who is in the high<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of heaven, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then the heavens. The diſtance of man from God, as God is in heaven and man on earth, is great, and the diſſimilitude of man to God, as God is holy and man corrupt, is farre
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:153845:63"/> greater; eyther of theſe Conſiderations ſingle is enough, but both theſe layd together, is aboundantly enough to keepe the heart in an humble ſelfe-abaſing frame before the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, Taking theſe words, <hi>Is not God in the hight of heaven?</hi> As the ſuppoſed ſpeech of <hi>Job,</hi> thou ſayeſt God is in the hight of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; that is, confined to heaven, ſo, that he looks no further, but thou art deceived, God is not lockt up in heaven, he looks to all things here on earth. As the earth is the Lords, and the fullnes of it, as to right &amp; propriety, ſo the earth is the Lords with all the fullnes of it, as to care and providence. Though there be a diſtinctnes in the manner or manifeſtation of his being in heaven and on earth; yet he is as truly and as much on earth as he is in heaven.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>God is omnipreſent, or every where.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though we are to adore and worſhip God as in heaven, yet we muſt not ſhutt up God in heaven; as he is in heaven, ſo he is upon the earth alſo, he is with us, yea he is in us, he is in all places, not circumſcribed by any, nor limited to any place. God is preſent in all places, and fills all places with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, onely he doth not declare his preſence alike in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Lord appeares where and as he pleaſeth, but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be otherwiſe or otherwhere then he is, and that is every where. While the Pſalmiſt queryed, <hi>Whether ſhall I goe from thy preſence?</hi> He was ſo farre from imagining that any ſuch place could be found, that in the very next words he concludeth God to be every where, by an enumeration of all places, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.7, 8.) <hi>If I aſcend up to heaven, thou art there; if I make my bed in Hel, behold thou are there.</hi> (Hel ſtandeth in utmoſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to heaven, as heaven in Scripture-language is the higheſt, ſo hell is the loweſt place; now ſayth <hi>David, If I make my bed in hell, thou art there) If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the utmoſt parts of the ſea, even there ſhall thy hand leade me, and thy right hand ſhall hold me;</hi> That is, there I ſhall find<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> thee efficaciouſly preſent with me. The Lord having ſaid (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.1.) <hi>Heaven is my throne,</hi> preſently adds, <hi>and the earth is my footſtoole;</hi> So the earth is called, becauſe its ſcituation in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is below the heavens, his throne is there, his footſtoole is
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:153845:63"/> here. (<hi>Jer.</hi> 23.23, 24.) <hi>Am I a God at hand, ſaith the Lord, and not afarre off? Can any hide himſelfe in ſecret places, that I ſhall not ſee him, ſaith the Lord? doe not I fill heaven and earth, ſaith the Lord?</hi> All theſe expoſtulating queſtions, are reſolved into this one poſition. God is every where; And though ſome reade the firſt, not as a Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eſtion, but as an Aſſertion, Thus; <hi>I am a God at hand, and not a God afarre off,</hi> yet the ſence is the ſame; God therein affirming, that he is ever neere us, and never afarre off from us whereſoever we are. Though God be in thoſe places which are furtheſt off from us, as well as in thoſe that are neere at hand, yet God himſelfe is never afarre off from us, but alwayes at hand. When <hi>Solomon</hi> had ſet up the Temple, (1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.27.) He was ſure of the preſence of God in it; and therefore did not ſpeake doubtingly, but admiringly, when he asked, <hi>But, will God indeed dwell on earth?</hi> (that is, will God manifeſt himſelfe gloriouſly on the earth?) <hi>behold the heaven, and heaven of heavens cannot conteine thee, how much leſſe this houſe that I have builded? Solomon</hi> knew that heaven could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine, that is, limit God, much leſſe could the houſe which he had builded. Yet the Lord made the Temple another heaven to himſelfe, it was as his ſecond heaven, there the Lord had a kinde of glorious reſidence, beyond what he had in any other part of the world; Now the Aſſemblyes and Congregations of the Saints are in a ſpeciall manner the dwelling place of God, and his ſecond heaven; He dwells ſo much in the Churches that he ſeemes not to dwell at all in any part of the world beſide (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16, 17.) <hi>I will dwell in them, and walke in them. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye ſeparate ſaith the Lord, and touch not the uncleane thing, and I will receive you.</hi> God who is in all the world, dwels onely in and with his people. They who ſeparate from whatſoever is unholy, have him neereſt them who is altogether Holy. To conclude this poynt, we may make uſe of that diſtinction of the Schooles to cleare the difference how a corporall ſubſtance, and a ſpirituall, as as alſo how a ſpirituall created and uncreated ſubſtance, may be ſayd to be in a place. All bodyes are in place <hi>circumſcriptive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> ſpirituall ſubſtances created, Angels and ſoules of men are in place <hi>definitively:</hi> Wee cannot draw a line about an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, as about the body of a man, yet the Angel is ſo in this
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:153845:64"/> place, as not in another: but God who is a ſpirit, and uncrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is in place <hi>repletively,</hi> that is, he filleth all places where he is, but is not limited by any place where he is, He is (as ſome have not unfitly ſpoken) <hi>a Spheare whoſe center is every where, and whoſe circumference is no where.</hi> This is a myſtery which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we are not able to comprehend by reaſon, but we muſt take it downe by faith. The Lord is in the height of heaven, yet ſo there, as he is not ſhut up there.</p>
                  <p>But if any ſhall yet querie, <hi>How is the Lord every where?</hi> how is he in heaven, and in earth? is it ſo as the Sunne may be ſaid to be every where? the Sunne is ſeated in heaven, yet is by way of communication on earth, the Sunne by light, heate, or influence is all the world over, in ſome degree or other, yet the Sunne moves onely in his Orbe. Or is God ſo every where as a Soveraigne Prince, who though in perſon he reſide here or there, yet in power and Authority he is every where within his own Dominion? I anſwer, No; Theſe alluſions are farre below this truth. God is every where, not onely as the Sunne by light, heate, and influence, not onely as a Prince, by his power and Authority, but (as we ſpeake) in perſon, and in his Eſſence. Further, the Lords preſence in all places is not as that of the aire, which is more every where then the Sunne; the aire is every where filling all places, and ſo encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing all bodies, as if it made them all but one Great body; yet that part of the aire that is in one place is not in another, for the aire is diviſible.<note place="margin">Divina eſſentia eſt tota intra omnia &amp; tota extra omnia, nuſquam incluſa aut excluſa om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia contineus, a nullo contenta, nec propterea immiſtu rebus aut rerum ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibus inquinata. <hi>Auguſt: Epiſt. 55. ad Dard:</hi>
                     </note> But we muſt not take up any ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of God, for as he is every where, ſo he is wholly every where; God cannot be divided or parted as the ayre is &amp; may. <hi>The Divine Eſſence</hi> (as one of the Ancients hath expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this aſtoniſhing myſterie) <hi>is whole within all things, and whole without all things, no where included, no where excluded, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining all things, conteined of nothing, yet not at all mingled with the nature of theſe things, nor defiled with their pollutions.</hi> That which the Philoſopher ſpeaks of the ſoule of man, <hi>(That it is all in the whole body, and whole in every part of the body)</hi> comes neereſt this myſtery. Some quarrell at that expreſſion about the ſoule, yet there is a truth in it. The ſoule is indiviſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:153845:64"/>
                  <p>But if God be every where, why doth Chriſt teach us to pray, <hi>Our father which art in heaven, (Mat.</hi> 6.13.) And when the Heathen made that ſcoffing demand, <hi>Where is now their God?</hi> Why did <hi>David</hi> Anſwer, <hi>Our God is in heaven,</hi> (Pſal. 115.2, 3.) To theſe and all other Texts of like import, wee may anſwer; heaven is not there ſpoken of as bounding the preſence of God, but as guiding the faith and hope of man. <hi>In the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 5.3.) <hi>will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will looke up.</hi> When the eye hath no ſight of any helpe on earth, then faith may have the cleareſt viſions of it in heaven. And while God appeares ſo little in any Gratious diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for his people on earth, that the enemy begins to ſcoffe, <hi>Where is now your God?</hi> Then his people have recourſe by faith to heaven, where the Lord not onely is, but is glorious in his appearings. From whence as he ſeeth how it is with us, ſo he ſeemes to have a kinde of advantage to relieve us.</p>
                  <p>But as ſome Scriptures ſeeme to confine God to heaven, ſo other Scriptures ſeem to deny that he is every where on earth. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayd to the people of <hi>Iſrael (Numb.</hi> 14.42.) <hi>Goe not up for the Lord is not among you.</hi> And againe (<hi>Deut.</hi> 7.21.) <hi>Thou ſhalt not be affrighted at them, for the Lord thy God is among you;</hi> with ſome the Lord is, with others the Lord is not; and he is with the ſame perſons at one time, not at another; How then can it be ſayd, that the Lord is every where preſent? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayth (and many other Texts which ſpeake in the ſame forme) that God was ſometimes with his people, and ſomtimes not; we are not to underſtand it at all of a local preſence, or abſence, but of a favourable preſence or abſence. Thus God is with ſome perſons, and not with others; thus he is ſometime preſent with, ſometime abſent from the ſame perſon. It was this favourable preſence for which <hi>Moſes</hi> did ſo earneſtly entreate the Lord (<hi>Exod.</hi> 33.15.) <hi>If thy preſence goe not with us, carry us no further;</hi> That is, unleſſe thou pleaſe to be with us, to proſper our way, and protect us in it, let us ſtay where we are. This preſence of God is a high favour indeed, and God is thus preſent but in few places (comparatively) of the whole earth.</p>
                  <p>Once more, thoſe Scriptures may ſeeme to imply that God is ſo in heaven, that he is not alſo upon the earth, which ſpeak
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:153845:65"/> of his coming downe from heaven to earth, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 11.5.) <hi>And the Lord came downe to ſee the City and the Tower which the Children of men builded.</hi> Whence ſome may inferre, if he came downe to ſee the City, then he was not there before, and if ſo, then he is not univerſally preſent in all places. Againe, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 18.20, 21.) <hi>And the Lord ſaid, becauſe the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and becauſe their ſinne is very grievous, I will goe downe now, and ſee whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is come unto me, and if not, I will know.</hi> This paſſage yeelds the ſame difficulty and objection; To both which we may adde that of <hi>David (Pſal.</hi> 14.2.) <hi>The Lord look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed downe from heaven upon the children of men, to ſee if there were any that did underſtand;</hi> He doth not ſay, God was among the children of men here below, but being in heaven (as a man ſtanding upon a high place or Tower) he looked downe.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Theſe Texts ſpeake of God after the manner of men, or they ſpeake thus, not to teach us, how God knowes what is done on earth, but to confirme, and aſſure us that the Lord doth clearely and certainly know whatſoever is done by or among men on earth, even as clearely &amp; certainly as a man knoweth any thing by his view upon the place. God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things preſently, without ſearching, though never ſo ſecret, and all things certainly without enquiring, though never ſo doubtfull. God neyther aſcends, nor deſcends; He doth not come downe by any motion, but he comes downe to our apprehenſion. He ſhewes us after our way, that he knoweth, becauſe we cannot conceave his way of knowledge. If I would aſſure another man that I certainly know ſuch a thing, I tell him, I came from the place, I ſaw it, or I beheld it with my own eyes; now that's all that is intended, when 'tis ſayd, The Lord came downe from heaven to behold, and ſee the Tower of <hi>Babell,</hi> and the condition of <hi>Sodom;</hi> Or it is, to admoniſh all Magiſtrates and Judges, that they paſſe no ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of puniſhment eyther upon places or perſons, upon bare heareſay and reports, but that they firſt enforme themſelves fully of the matter of fact, as <hi>Job</hi> profeſſed his courſe was in all legal proceedings (<hi>Chap.</hi> 29.16.) <hi>The cauſe which I knew not I ſearched out.</hi> Thus wee ſee notwithſtanding all theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parances from Texts of Scripture to the contrary, That this
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:153845:65"/> Scripture-truth ſtandeth firme, The Lord is ſo in the height of heaven, that he is every where alſo here upon the earth.</p>
                  <p>From which take theſe two Deductions.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Seeing the Lord is every where preſent, we ſhould be eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where holy.</q>
                  <p>For where ſoever he is, he is the holy Lord; That was the charge which God gave to <hi>Abraham; Walke before me, and be upright;</hi> As if he had ſayd, Whereſoever thou walkeſt, walke as having me preſent with thee, and be upright in my preſence. <hi>I</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> a type of Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.8.) <hi>have ſet the Lord alwayes before me, he is at my right hand, I ſhall not be moved.</hi> He that by fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th eyes God continually as his protector in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſhall not be moved with any evill that he ſuffers, and he that eyes God by faith as his patterne in holineſſe, ſhall not be moved from doing that which is good. This thought, <hi>The Lord is at our right hand,</hi> keepes us from turning eyther to the right hand or to the left. It is ſaid of <hi>Enoch,</hi> that he <hi>walked with God, (Gen.</hi> 5.22.) and though the Hiſtorie of his life be very ſhort, yet 'tis ſayd of him a ſecond time (<hi>ver.</hi> 24.) That he <hi>walked with God.</hi> He walked ſo much with God, that he walked as God, he did not walke (which kinde of walking the Apoſtle reproves, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3.) <hi>as men.</hi> He walked ſo little, like the world, that his ſtay was little in the world. <hi>He was not</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>for God tooke him.</hi> He tooke him from the world to himſelfe, or (as the Author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> reports it) <hi>he was tranſlated that he ſhould not ſee death, for he received this teſtimony that he pleaſed God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, It followeth; if God be every where preſent,
<q>That the godly are never out of the reach of God to helpe them, and that the wicked are never out of the reach of God to puniſh them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>(<hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.2.) <hi>When thou paſſeſt through the waters I will be with thee, and when thou walkeſt through the fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt.</hi> The preſence of God is the protection of Saints in the evill which they ſuffer; and they who doe evill cannot be hid from his puniſhing preſence. There is no running from God. It is ſaid of <hi>Jonah</hi> (Chap. 1.3.) <hi>That he fled from the preſence of God.</hi>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:153845:66"/> Whether fled he? The Text ſaith he fled to Sea, but did not God finde him there? He fled from the commanding preſence of God, but he fell into the angry preſence of God. We have a large deſcription in the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Amos,</hi> how carnall men hope to ſhift out of the hand of God. <hi>I</hi> (ſayth the Lord) <hi>will ſlay the laſt of them with the ſword, though they dig to hell, thence ſhall my hand take them.</hi> We read what wiſe counſell the ſervants of the King of <hi>Benhadad</hi> gave him after he had been defeated by the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (1 <hi>King.</hi> 20.23, 24, 25.) <hi>Their Gods are Gods of the hils, therefore they were ſtronger then we, but let us fight againſt them in the plaines, and ſurely we ſhall be ſtronger then they. Make thee an Army like the Army that thou haſt loſt, horſe for horſe, and Chariot for Chariot, and we will fight againſt them in the plaine, and ſurely we ſhall be ſtronger then they, and he hearkened to their voice and did ſo.</hi> Why did they deſire to fight them upon the plaine? they thought God was a God of the hills and not of the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, but (<hi>ver.</hi> 28.) <hi>A man of God ſayd to the King of Iſrael, thus ſaith the Lord, becauſe the Aſſyrians have ſaid, the Lord is God of the hills and not of the valleys, therefore will I deliver this great multitude into thy hand.</hi> As if he had ſaid, however you deſerve not in the leaſt, that I ſhould owne you, or aſſiſt your cauſe, yet that I may confute the blaſphemous and derogatory principles of theſe <hi>Syrians,</hi> I will give you a ſecond victory againſt them, even in the valleys, where they ſuppoſe they have you at an advantage, and ſhall deale with you beyond the extent of my power and Territory. Though God had no cauſe to reſpect the honour of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> yet he could not forget the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his owne name, which was obſcured by thoſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious <hi>Syrians.</hi> The moſt received Doctrine &amp; Divinity of the Heathens confined their Gods to certaine places, ſome to this City, &amp; ſome to that, ſome to the hills, &amp; ſome to the plaines, ſome to the Sea, others to the Land. 'Tis ſayd that the ſame night in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> 
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great (of whoſe Conqueſts <hi>Daniel</hi> Propheſied) was borne, that the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> at <hi>Epheſus</hi> was burnt to the ground. And the Heathens gave this as the reaſon of it, becauſe <hi>Diana</hi> was abſent from hir Temple, being gone to aſſiſt at the birth of <hi>Alexander;</hi> implying that their Goddeſs was ſo in one place as ſhe could not attend what was done elſewhere. Such were the groſſe conceits which they had
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:153845:66"/> of their Gods, and they imagined the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be ſuch a one as their owne. The verieſt Idolater in the world pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes his God as good as any is. But Jehova the living God hath taught us to ſay, <hi>Who is a God like unto thee?</hi> and our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences have ſealed to it, that <hi>there is none like the God of Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run, who rideth on the heavens for thy helpe, and in his excellency on the skyes (Deut.</hi> 33.26.) And wee have learned to comfort our ſelves in all places and ſtreights, in this aſſurance that he is the <hi>God of the hills as well as of the valleys, of the Sea, as well as the dry Land, and that he is as truely preſent in the loweſt depths as in the higheſt heavens. Is not God in the height of heaven?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>And behold the height of the Starres how high they are.</q>
                  <p>The Hebrew is, <hi>Behold the head of the Starres;</hi> The head of a man is the higheſt part of him, and the head of any thing is the top of it. <hi>Behold the head or height of the Starres how high they are;</hi> Starres are high, but God is higher; many creatures are high, but God is high above all creatures. The creature is ſtrong, but God is ſtronger, the creature is wiſe, but God is wiſer, the creature is glorious, but God is infinitely more glorious; The glory, wiſdome, ſtrength, and higheſt height of the creature, is but a glimpſe of what God is. <hi>The Starres are high.</hi> I ſhall not enter into an Aſtronomicall Diſcourſe about the Starres, or the height of Starres. I ſhall not meddle with a <hi>Jacobs ſtaffe,</hi> to take the elevation of the Starres, no need of ſuch Diſcourſe here, all that is intended by <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> is a proofe that God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely exalted in his highnes and majeſty above the Starres.</p>
                  <q>Behold the height of the Starres how high they are.</q>
                  <p>This word <hi>behold</hi> in Scripture is often applied to things of <hi>wonder;</hi> To ſay, <hi>behold,</hi> is not a calling for the bare act of the eye to ſee the height of the Starres, but it calls for a worke of the minde, duly to conſider of, and to wonder at their height. Some creatures, eſpecially the heavenly, are not onely uſefull, but wonderfull; and 'tis as hard to underſtand them, as it is comfortable to enjoy them. The Hebrew word for <hi>Heaven</hi> cometh from a roote which ſignifies to amaze and aſtoniſh; And indeed there are naturall wonders and myſteries enow in the heavens to aſtoniſh any conſidering man. And the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:153845:67"/> why we are no more aſtoniſht at them, or doe no more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire them, is becauſe we doe ſo little conſider them. We of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>ſee</hi> or <hi>looke</hi> upon the Starres, but we ſeldome <hi>behold</hi> them. And therefore <hi>David</hi> ſaith (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.3.) <hi>When I conſider the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, the worke of thy fingers, the Moone and the Starres which thou haſt ordained; what is man that thou art mindfull of him?</hi> As the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding and conſideration of our owne workes will make us aſhamed, becauſe they appeare ſo bad, ſo the conſideration and beholding of the works of God will make us aſtoniſht, becauſe they appeare both ſo good and great. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1.) what manner of Love the father hath beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God; even this tranſcendent Love of God in our Adoption is paſſed by as a ſmall matter by thoſe who will not take the paines (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the pleaſure) and leyſure to behold and conſider the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it. No mervaile if the power of God in making the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Starres be paſſed by as a low thing, by thoſe who doe not behold, that is, diligently conſider them.</p>
                  <q>Behold the height of the Starres how high they are.</q>
                  <p>Wee are called to conſider this.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>That it is our duty to contemplate the excellency of the creature.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God hath not onely given us the booke of the Scripture, but of the creature, and we muſt attend to the reading of this as well as of that, even to the reading of every leaſe and line of it. There are foure great leaves of this booke. Firſt, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; ſecondly, the earth; thirdly, the Sea; fourthly, the aire. Theſe are the foure great leaves of this booke of the creature; in every one of which we ſhould labour to be expert Scholars, and ſpel out the name and minde of God in them. For though (as I ſaid before) beholding notes wondering, yet wee muſt not behold them to wonder at them, like children; but we muſt behold them to learne ſomewhat from them, or to be inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them as men.</p>
                  <q>Behold the Starres.</q>
                  <p>Firſt, In their number; As God ſaid to <hi>Abraham (Gen.</hi> 15.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:153845:67"/> 5.) <hi>Looke now towards Heaven, and tell the Starres if thou be able to number them; and he ſaid unto him, ſo ſhall thy ſeed be.</hi> 'Tis mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of wonder that God ſhould make ſo many of thoſe emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Lights, that he ſhould ſet up ſo many flaming torches in heaven for man to ſee his way, and worke by on earth. That God who hath ſpread this Canopie over our heads, ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo embroyder it with ſuch a multitude of Golden ſpangles, which render it as much our delight, as it is our duty, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Behold the Starres in their order, they move by rule, they keepe their rankes, none of them goe out of their place, or forſake their ſtation. They who are skilled in the motion of the Starres, know where to have them a hundred yeare hence. In the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Judges,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>The Starres in their courſes fought againſt Siſſera.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We ſhould conſider the Starres in their magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, what vaſt bodyes they are; Some of them are bigger then the whole body of the earth (as Philoſophy teacheth us) though, to appearance not bigger then the blaſe of a Candle, nor broader then the palme of a hand.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Conſider alſo the difference of the Starres in their greatneſſe, and magnitude, they are all great, but not all of a greatneſſe, not all of one ſize. Aſtronomers divide the Starres into ſixe magnitudes. We ſhould likewiſe obſerve, and wonder at their light, which is their glory: the light of the Starres is the glory of the Starres, and ſo the more light any Starre hath, the more glory it hath. Thus <hi>one Starre differeth from another Starre in glory</hi> (1 Cor. 15.41.) But I ſhall not ſtay upon theſe things, having inſiſted ſomwhat largely upon them at the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 9. Whether I referre the Reader. Onely note here that as the Starres of heaven are of ſeveral degrees; God hath not levell'd them, eyther in light or magnitude: ſo he hath diverſly diſtributed the light of parts, and gifts, of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and knowledge, of eſtate and power, to and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the children of men here on earth. 'Tis good for all, that all are not alike; The univerſe could not be eyther ſo beautiful, or ſo orderly, if every particular had the ſame beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or were of the ſame order. And he that cannot be content to have leſſe, and to be leſſer then another, is altogether unfit,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:153845:68"/> not onely to be as great, or to have as much as another, but to be or have any thing at all. Nor is any man more fit to be more then he is, then he that can rejoyce while another is more then he.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>The creature leads us to God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That's the tendency and ſcope of all that is here aſſerted. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> calls not <hi>Job</hi> to the meditation, or contemplation of the Starres to leave him there. Some ſtudy the heavens much, but their lives are earthly; they ſtudy the Starres, yet there is nothing but dirt in their hearts, and the reaſon is, becauſe they ſtudy the Starres, for the Starres ſake, and not for Gods ſake, and make the Starres their end, not their way, or as Starres, to lead them to God. This is the reaſon why many Aſtronomers and Philoſophers, who buſie their heads and minds much in ſpeculation about the nature of the heavenly bodyes, know not at all what it is to have their converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in heaven, or to minde the things that are above. Wee ſhould ſo behold the glory of the Starres, as from thence to inferre, that God is much more glorious, yea, that, theſe things which were made glorious, have no glory in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that Glory which made them. <hi>Plato</hi> taught his Scollers to ſay; <hi>The earth is beautifull, the heavens are more beautifull, but God who made the earth, and the heavens, is more beautifull then both.</hi> The viſible creature ſhewes the inviſible God (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1, 2.) <hi>The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament ſheweth his handy worke.</hi> But O how glorious is the inviſible God, who hath made ſuch viſible creatures? and what a work-Maſter is he who hath ſet up ſuch a work? (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20.) <hi>The inviſible things of him from the creation of the world, are clearely ſeene, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternall power and godhead.</hi> The things that are made, carry us to the maker of them, and they tell us, that none but he who hath an eternall power and godhead, could poſſibly make them. The Heathen thought the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, to be Gods, therefore certainly there is very much of God, much of the glory and power of God to be ſeene in them. And <hi>Job</hi> ſaith (which doth plainly ſhew that in nature it is ſo, <hi>Chap.</hi> 31.26.)
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:153845:68"/> 
                     <hi>If I beheld the Sunne when it ſhined, or the Moone walking in bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and my heart hath been ſecretly inticed, or my mouth hath kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my hand, this alſo were an iniquity to be puniſhed by the Judge, for I ſhould have denyed the God that is above.</hi> That is, if I have been inticed to worſhip the Sunne, or Moone, as raviſht with their beauty (for 'tis ſo farre from being a ſin, that 'tis a duty to behold the Sunne when it ſhineth, and the Moone walking in brightnes, but ſo to behold them as to adore them, or doe obeyſance to them, (which was the cuſtome of the Heathen, expreſſed it ſeemes among them by kiſſing their hand, as we doe at this day in token of reſpect and reverence to men above us) this is an iniquity even that groſſe iniquity of Idolatry, or <hi>worſhipping the creature in ſtead of or more then the Creator, who is bleſſed for evermore.</hi> Now (I ſay) inaſmuch as theſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have ſo much of God in them, that many Heathens have miſtaken them for God, how will it condemne us of dulneſs and ſtupidity, if we be be not led to God in the knowledge and beholding of them? For as to make theſe creatures Gods, ſo not to ſee God in theſe creatures, is to deny the God that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, While we behold the Starres of heaven, it ſhould exceedingly both humble us and make us thankful, for whoſe uſe, comfort, and accommodation in this life, God ſet up thoſe Glorious Lights. God did not make them for his owne uſe, he had no need of them, he was from everlaſting without any of theſe creatures. The Starres are nothing to him; The Sunne is nothing to him; yea in that ſtate of glory where we ſhall injoy God for ever, we ſhall have light without Sunne; ſo that theſe lights were made for our uſe, and for ours onely while we are walking in the darke vale of this preſent world. Now, while we <hi>behold the height of the Starres how high they are,</hi> and conſider for whom as well as by whom they were made; even for us, for poore us, who are but duſt and aſhes: This ſhould at once lay us low in humblenes (looking upon them as an honour to great for us) and rayſe us up in thankfullnes, becauſe the benefit and comfort of them is ſo great to us. Thus <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes in that excellent prophecy of Chriſt (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.3.) <hi>When I conſider thy heavens the worke of thy fingers, the Moone, and the Starres, which thou haſt ordained, what is man that thou art mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

                  <p>
                     <hi>Eliphaz</hi> having laid downe theſe two Propoſitions, <hi>God is on high, and the Starres are high,</hi> proceeds to make an inference from both, which he formeth up (by way of ſuppoſition) from <hi>Jobs</hi> owne mouth.</p>

                  <p>Wee may anſwer; Firſt, Negatively, Not by ſence, as wee; eyes and eares are aſcribed to God improperly in Scripture; nor doth God know by diſcourſe, drawing one thing from another; but in the Affirmative, he knowes intuitively, he knowes every thing nakedly in it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Againe, Some read, <hi>What doth God know?</hi> how farre doth his eye extend? what are the objects of his knowledge? To this we may anſwer, God knoweth all things; even the hearts of all the children of men; There are no ſecrets to God. But whether wee expound it of the manner or matter of divine knowledge, the ſence is the ſame, eyther an affirmation that God did not know all things, or at leaſt a doubt whether he did or no. <hi>Thou ſayeſt, How doth God know?</hi> But where, and when did <hi>Job</hi> ſay this? <hi>Job</hi> might challenge <hi>Eliphaz;</hi> bring your proofes and witneſſes againſt me; why doe you impute ſuch thoughts to me, and frame ſuch imaginations in my breaſt? certainly <hi>Job</hi> never ſpake this, and as ſurely <hi>Job</hi> never thought this; yet <hi>Eliphaz</hi> puts it directly upon him. What was his ground?<note place="margin">Exiſtimabet haec conſequi ex Jobi dictis, quaſi neceſſe ſit eum qui dicat impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bos proſpere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere, exiſtimare etiam deum res humanas non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curare. <hi>Merl.</hi>

So here, he hath onely this to prove his ſuppoſition, that <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, <hi>How doth God know?</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Job</hi> had ſayd, that God doth ſometime proſper wicked men, and afflicts the righteous. As if he who ſayth, that God ſuffers wicked men to proſper in this life, muſt needs alſo ſay, that God regards not the things of this life; ſo that <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſeemes to ſpeake thus; <hi>We have heard thee ſaying, that the wicked proſper, and that the godly are afflicted;</hi> what need we any further witnes, that thy opinion is, <hi>God neyther takes notice nor care of the things here below.</hi> Out of thine owne mouth we condemne

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus (1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.13.) <hi>Naboth</hi> was accuſed of <hi>blaſpheming God and the King.</hi> Chriſt himſelfe was taxed with blaſphemy more then once, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 9.3.) <hi>And behold certaine of the Scribes ſaid within themſelves, this man blaſphems.</hi> There they did not openly averre it, but they ſaid it within themſelves.

                     <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſayth, <hi>Job</hi> denied providence, whereas <hi>Job</hi> adored it; that he denyed Gods knowledge of the good and evil done in the world, becauſe he maintained, that good men receive evill, and evill men good in the world. When we deny tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, or that the bread is changed into the very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the body of Chriſt; Papiſts inferre, that we deny, that Chriſt ſpake truely, when at his Laſt Supper he ſaid, <hi>This is my body;</hi> and they will hence force it upon us, that we ſay, <hi>God is not omnipotent,</hi> becauſe we affirme that it is inconſiſtent with the nature of a true humane body (ſuch as Chriſt hath now in heaven, though glorified and ſpirituall) to be in many places at once. For as ſome deny the omnipreſence of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo Papiſts affirme the omni-preſence of the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, And (ſay they) while we deny this, we deny the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency of God. Others charge us that we make God the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſinne, and that, according to our tenet, all the impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and wickedneſſe that is in the world, lyeth at his doore; becauſe we affirme, That God hath paſſed an Eternal abſolute

                  <p>Further, Thou ſayeſt, <hi>How doth God know?</hi> Take it eyther of the inward or of the outward ſaying, eyther of the tongue or of the heart, ſaying ſo; <hi>Eliphaz</hi> would prove from it, that certainly <hi>Job</hi> was a wicked man.

                  <p>Hence obſerve;
<q>That to have evill thoughts, or to ſpeake evill of God, is the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a wicked man.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that is good, muſt needs both thinke, and ſpeake good of God. <hi>David</hi> doth often aggravate the wickedneſſe of his enemies, from the language of their hearts and tongues, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.11.) <hi>He hath ſaid in his heart, God hath forgotten, he hides his face, he will never ſee.</hi> And againe (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.7, 8, 11.) <hi>Send thy hand from above, rid me and deliver me out of great waters, from the hands of ſtrange children, whoſe mouth ſpeaketh vanity, and their right hand, is a right hand of falſehood.</hi> If the mouth ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vanity, the hand is full of falſehood; we may even feele deceite in their hands, whoſe mouthes ſpeake any kinde of vanity, but eſpecially this, which is the vaineſt vanity of all, <hi>How doth God know?</hi> or ſurely God doth not know. Such the Pſalmiſt rebukes (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.4, 5.7.) <hi>How long ſhall they utter and ſpeake hard things?</hi> What things were thoſe?

                  </p>
                  <q>And <hi>(which is the ſame in other words)</hi> can he judge through the dark cloud?</q>
                  <p>As if <hi>Job</hi> had further argued thus; I am ſafe enough from the knowledge of God, for as he is high above me, ſo there are dark clouds between him and me; <hi>Can he judge through the dark cloud?</hi> My opinion is he cannot. For knowledge goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Juſtice is pictured blind, in reference to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but not in reference to things or cauſes; Juſtice muſt take no notice of this or that man, whether he be great or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, high or low, a neere friend or a ſtranger; Juſtice is blinde as to all theſe conſiderations, and knoweth no man; but Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice muſt know every mans caſe and cauſe; unleſſe man know that, how can be judge? and if God know not that, how can he judge? He muſt have light to ſee what is done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he paſſe Sentence upon what is done; therefore, <hi>Can he judge through the darke cloud?</hi> Surely he cannot. Thus the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt concludeth indeed; and thus <hi>Eliphaz</hi> repreſents <hi>Job</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding in his owne heart; there is not onely a great diſtance between God and me, not onely is he in the height of heaven, and I below on earth, but there are many gloomy clouds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and me; As he is high above me, ſo there are ſuch impediments in the way that he cannot ſee me. The Vulgar reads,<note place="margin">Et quaſi per caliginum judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat. <hi>Vulg.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>He judgeth as through darknes.</hi> Now the beſt of Saints <hi>ſee God through a Glaſſe darkly, or in a ridle</hi> (1 Cor. 13.12.) And ſecure ſinners thinke that God ſeeth them onely through a cloud darkly, or (as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpeaketh) <hi>through a dark cloud;</hi> he knoweth not clearly, but dimly. To judge through a cloud, is to judge of things confuſedly, not diſtinctly, by gueſſe or conjecturally, not exactly or face to face. This is all the ſight which an evill heart alloweth God (if he allow him any) concerning his wayes and actions. They who doe things which cannot abide the light, are willing to beleeve that all they doe is in the darke. Theirs are works of moral darknes, and therefore they pleaſe themſelves with thinking that their works are hid eyther in natural or artificiall darkneſs. It is ſayd of the Lord in Scripture (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.2.) <hi>Clouds and darknes are round about him, while judgement and righteouſneſſe are the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of his throne;</hi> but theſe imagine that God cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in judgement and righteouſneſſe, becauſe clouds and darkneſs are round about him. It is ſayd (1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.10, 11, 12.) <hi>The cloud filled the houſe of the Lord, ſo that the Prieſts could not ſtand to miniſter becauſe of the cloud, for the glory of the Lord fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the houſe of the Lord. Then ſpake Solomon, the Lord ſaid that he will dwell in the thick darkneſs.</hi> Reade <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.21. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.22.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:153845:72"/> 
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.11. <hi>God is light</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>John</hi> 1 <hi>Ep:</hi> 1.) <hi>and he dwelleth in light which no man can approach unto</hi> (1 Tim. 6.16.) How then can he be ſaid to dwell in thick darknes? I anſwer; thoſe Scriptures which ſay that God dwells in darknes, that clouds and darkneſſe are round about him, teach us, that God and his wayes are much hid from us; we are not able to look up to him, or ſee clearely what he doth, much leſſe can we ſee what his counſells are. The clouds and darkneſſe which are about him, doe not hinder his ſight of us, but our ſight of him. Our darknes is no darknes to him, but his darknes, yea his light is darknes to us. Againe, God is ſayd to dwel in a cloud, to reprove our boldnes and curioſity, who are too apt to pry into what is not to be knowne, and to neglect our duty in what we know, or to neglect the knowledge of our duty. God hath ſome reſerves in counſells; ſome of his providences are wrapt up in clouds. Hee will be truſted and honored in what he is not ſeene or knowne. Not to know theſe things is indeed our neſcience, but not our ignorance, and not to ſeeke after the knowledg of theſe things, is our duty not our ſloath. Thus God who dwels in light, dwels alſo in a cloud; for he <hi>dwells in light that no man can</hi> (no nor ought to) <hi>approach unto.</hi> Wee may come neere his light by faith, but wee cannot come neere his light by knowledge. There is ſuch an infinite, ſuch an overcomming light in God, that it is a darknes to us; the moſt Eagle-like eyes of a humane underſtanding are not onely dazzel'd, but quite blinded with his brightneſs. Now as no man can judge through this light of God, ſo ſome men are ready to ſay (and thus <hi>Eliphaz</hi> brings in <hi>Job</hi> ſaying) that God cannot judge through dark clouds, through clouds and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Nor doth <hi>Eliphaz</hi> bring in <hi>Job</hi> ſaying thus only by way of doubt or queſtion, but by way of averrement and reſolution in the next verſe.</p>

<q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Carnal men frame conceptions of God like themſelves.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the hypocrite is deſcribed (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21.) <hi>Thou though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt that I was altogether ſuch a one as thy ſelfe.</hi> Not that he thought God was a man, but that God had ſuch thoughts of good and evill, as man hath. As if what is right in mans eyes, were ſo in the eyes of God alſo; or as if what did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe man, were pleaſing, or not much diſpleaſing unto God. When the Lord ſayth (<hi>Eſay</hi> 55.8.) <hi>My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor your wayes my wayes;</hi> he doth plainly intimate, that they did begin to frame thoughts of God like their owne: but ſaith God, <hi>as the heavens are higher then the earth, ſo are my thoughts then your thoughts, and my wayes then your wayes;</hi> That is, as my thoughts have a vaſtnes in them to all things beyond yours, ſo eſpecially in this thing, the performance of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe for the pardon of ſinne. O how unlike is God to man in this? God is not more unlike man in his abſolute freedome from the leaſt inclination to commit any the leaſt ſin, then he is in the admirable freenes of his inclination to pardon any even the greateſt ſinne. Men are commonly not onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull to thoſe who wrong them, but revengefull, and when once offended are hardly drawne to a reconcilement, and ſeldome ſo fully reconciled, but that ſomwhat of offence ſtayeth behinde. But the thoughts of God are not ſo. He is ſlow to wrath, and ready to forgive. He quickly pardons the offence, and receives the offender into favour; no more retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the memory of his offence (as to his hurt) then if he had
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:153845:74"/> never offended. Thus the Lord would aſſure ſinners, that his thoughts in pardoning ſinne are not as theirs. And it is but need he ſhould doe ſo; For when ſinners begin to be awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they frame ſuch thoughts of God, as to pardon of ſin, as they have in themſelves: when they looke upon their ſinnes as too bigg to be pardoned by man, they conclude preſently the Lord cannot or will not pardon them. And as many under temptation, frame thoughts of God like their owne about the pardon of ſinne; ſo it is the conſtant courſe of wicked men (which is indeed the worſt of their ſinnes) to frame thoughts of God like unto themſelves, while they commit and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in ſinne. Man ſhould not dare to Imagine any thing of God in reference eyther to his juſtice or mercy, eyther about the puniſhing or pardoning of ſinne, but what he hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of himſelfe, all that wee Imagine beſide that, is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of another God. There are many falſe gods made with mens hands, but the hearts of men make many more. The heart of man makes thouſands of falſe or ſtrange gods. Every undue, every wrong Imagination of God, is the forming up of a ſtrange, of a new god. When we aſcribe to God ſuch a kinde of power, ſuch a kinde of knowledge, ſuch a kinde of holines, ſuch a kinde of juſtice, ſuch a kinde of mercy, as is common to the creature, in all this wee frame up a new god to our ſelves. And thus thoſe Gentiles of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. &amp; 25.) <hi>Became vaine in their Imaginations, and their fooliſh heart was darkened;</hi> in what was their fooliſh heart darkened? in falſe notions of God; therefore they are ſaid (<hi>ver.</hi> 29.) <hi>to change the glory of the Incorruptible God into an Image made like to Corruptible man, and to birds, foure-footed beaſts, and creeping things.</hi> Now as there is the changing of the glory of the Incorruptible God into the Image of a Corruptible man, that is, into the Externall Image of a Corruptible man, (for ſome ſet up falſe gods in the likenes of men;) So there is a Changing of the glory of the Incorruptible God, into the Internall Image of a Corruptible man, that is, into ſuch thoughts and Conceptions as are ordinarily in men. Let ſuch conſider, that, if to make a worſhip of our owne for the true God, be indeed to ſet up a falſe god; (all they worſhip falſe gods who ſet up a ſtrange worſhip for the true God, now, I
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:153845:74"/> ſay, if they who do but ſet up a new worſhip for the true God make a ſtrange God) what then doe they who in their hearts ſet up a new God, that is, who frame Conceptions of God which himſelfe never gave ground for in his word? Such was the Conceit which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had of <hi>Job,</hi> when he preſumes him ſaying, <hi>How doth God know? Can he judge through the dark cloud?</hi>

(<hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.11.) <hi>Hee hath ſaid in his heart God hath forgotten, he hides his face, he will never ſee it.</hi> Who this <hi>He</hi> is, whoſe heart ſpeakes this language, appeares clearely in the former part of the Pſalme, where he is more then once called <hi>The wicked (ver.</hi> 2, 3.) and where more then one of his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſes are deſcribed, (<hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8, 9, 10.) <hi>His mouth is full of curſing and deceit, and fraud, under his tongue is miſchiefe and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he ſitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the ſecret places doth he murder the innocent</hi> &amp;c. After all this, he <hi>ſayth in his heart God hath forgotten,</hi> that is, he hath forgotten the poore whom I have under my power, therefore I may ſafely oppreſſe them. <hi>He hideth his face, he will never ſee it;</hi> that is, God will never take any knowledge, either of my doings or of their ſufferings. We have a ſample of the ſame impiety (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.11.) <hi>And they ſay how doth God know? and is there knowledge in the moſt high? behold, theſe are the ungodly in the world,</hi> &amp;c. And againe (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.6 <hi>ver.) They ſlay the widdow, and ſtranger, and murther the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe</hi> (here are their workes of darkneſſe) <hi>yet they ſay, the Lord ſhall not ſee, neither ſhall the God of Jacob regard.</hi> Not onely did they preſume that the Lord did not ſee, but that he ſhould not; <hi>The Lord ſhall not ſee!</hi> As if they could ſtop or blinde the eyes of God as eaſily as they had blinded their owne Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. Take one Inſtance further (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.12.) <hi>Then ſaid he
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:153845:75"/> unto mee Sonne of man, Seeſt thou what they doe? haſt thou ſeene what the Ancients of the houſe of Iſraell doe in the darke, Every man in the Chambers of his Imagery, for they ſay the Lord ſeeth us not, he hath forſaken the Earth.</hi> Much like the language here, <hi>He walketh in the Circuit of heaven;</hi> hee hath other buſines to doe then to minde us. As God is ſometimes ſayd to forſake the Earth in wrath, to puniſh the ſin of Man, ſo wicked men ſay he alwayes forſakes the Earth in neglect both of their ſin and puniſhment. And as Idolaters who have a minde to other gods, are willing to beleeve that God hath forſaken the earth, as to the protection of them; Wee (ſay they) are in danger, God takes no care of us, therefore blame us not if we betake our ſelves to other Gods for protection; <hi>If he had not forſaken us, we had not forſaken him:</hi> So all ſorts of reſolved tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, who have a minde to any ſinfull way, are willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that God hath forſaken the earth, as to any obſervation of them. Wee may doe what we liſt, for God doth not minde or regard what we are doing. If we thought he did indeed ſee us, we durſt not thus ſinne againſt him. But ſeeing he doth not trouble himſelfe with any care about us, why ſhould we trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelves with any feare about him? Now, this <hi>Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that God doth not ſee us in what we are doing, opens a doore to the doing of all Evill.</hi> Security from danger is the great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto ſin. Though wicked men would not be leſſe ſinfull, yet they would not ſin ſo much, or be ſo full of ſin, did they not vainely flatter themſelves out of the ſight of God. Every Man would faine beleeve that God doth not ſee him when he is doing that which he would not have ſeene or be ſeene in doing it. And how do men pleaſe themſelves in this falſe hope that God doth not ſee them, when they doe that which is diſpleaſing unto God!</p>
                  <p>From the Intendment of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> to Convince <hi>Job,</hi> that the Clouds are no Covering to God, and that the Circuit of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven doth not Confine him.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> God is omniſcient, hee knowes all things.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou ſayeſt thus; <hi>How doth God know?</hi> I tell thee God doth know; And thou haſt an argument upon thy backe, if thou haſt
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:153845:75"/> none in thy heart to prove it, thy ſence or feeling may teach thee, if thy reaſon or underſtanding doe not, and by thy ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering thou mayeſt ſee that God ſeeth what thou haſt been do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This great truth, <hi>That God is omniſcient, or knowes all,</hi> may eaſily be knowne, and ought to be beleeved by all. When the Lord had made the world in ſix dayes (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31.) <hi>He ſaw all that he had made;</hi> All was in view at once, hee had a Proſpect of the whole Creation in his eye. And as all his own Creatures, ſo all our Creatures are ſeene by God; hee ſeeth all that himſelfe hath made, and hee ſeeth all that wee have made, or are making day by day. (<hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5.) <hi>God ſaw that the wickednes of man was great in the earth, and that every thought of the Imagination of the thoughts of his heart was onely evill Continually, or every day. The Lord ſaw,</hi> that is, the Lord knew fully (infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more fully then we know thoſe things which wee ſee) every Imagination or figment of the thoughts of mans heart. The figment of our thoughts, is what the minde faſhioneth or maketh up within it ſelfe by thinking: corrupt nature keepes a conſtant mint of evill imaginations in the head, as it hath a ſinke of filthy affections in the heart. The minde of man hath a formative faculty in it. And the ſame word which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt uſeth to ſignifie the worke of God in making man, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7.) <hi>The Lord God formed man out of the duſt of the earth, or duſt out of the earth</hi> (the ſame word, I ſay) is uſed in the Noune (<hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5.) to ſignifie, <hi>the imagination of man,</hi> becauſe that is alwayes ſhaping moulding or forming one ſort of thoughts or other, &amp;, naturally, none but ugly evill thoughts. Theſe are the creatures which man (as fallen) is the maker of; and he maketh (as I may ſay) infinite creatures, he is forming them continually in his imagination, that's the ſhop wherein there's a dayly Creation (ſuch as it is) of monſtrous wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, till God by his new Creation changeth the frame and nature of it. Now (I ſay) as God ſeeth his owne creatures; ſo he ſeeth all our Creatures, though wee make them in the ſhop of our darkeſt imaginations. And much more doth hee ſee all the Creatures which wee make without, that is, all our bodily and externall actions. (<hi>Jere.</hi> 17.10.) <hi>I the Lord ſearch the heart, I try the reynes;</hi> if he ſearch our hearts, then ſurely he ſearcheth all our wayes, if he ſeeth our thinkings, then ſurely
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:153845:76"/> he ſeeth our walkings.<note place="margin">Deus ſcientia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, phurale, perfectam ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiam &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum omnium cognoſibilium cognitionem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicat.</note> Therefore 'tis ſayd (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.3.) <hi>The Lord is a God of knowledge;</hi> the Hebrew is, <hi>The Lord is a God of knowledges;</hi> that is, all things fall under his knowledge; he is perfect in all knowledges, there is nothing knowable, but the Lord knowes it; <hi>and by him actions are weighed:</hi> now the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of actions is more then the ſeeing of actions; many ſee that which they cannot weigh. <hi>Hee weigheth actions,</hi> that is, he takes not onely the action it ſelfe, but every circumſtance of it into Conſideration; he takes his Ballances, and tryes fully, how much each ingredient weighs, and what it comes to. Hee weighs whole States, Kingdomes, and Nations. So it was ſayd to the Babylonian Monarch <hi>Belteſhazzar (Dan.</hi> 5.26.27.) Mene, <hi>God hath numbred thy Kingdome, and finiſhed it,</hi> Tekel, <hi>Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.</hi> Thy councels, thy policies, thy undertakings, the whole compaſſe, all the contrivances of thy Government are weighed and found too light. And as God weigheth the actions of Princes, ſo of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons. (<hi>Prov.</hi> 5.21.) <hi>The wayes of a man</hi> (that is, of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man, even of the meaneſt man) <hi>are before the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes;</hi> he puts them into a Ballance, and doth not onely ſee them, but ponder or weigh them. <hi>David</hi> ſayth of ſome wicked men that they weigh the violence of their hands in the earth (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.2.) though they doe violence, yet they doe it not violently, but with a kinde of skill and deliberation. They doe wrong and oppreſſe with a ſhew of Juſtice, whereof weights are the common Embleme. Now as ſome men doe evill, not haſtily, raſhly, or all at once, but give it out by weight, and with a ſeeming gravity and zeale for juſtice. So the Lord doth never looke over the wayes of men raſhly or haſtily, but weighs them out even to a graine, yea to the duſt of the balance he pondereth all their paths. That is, he knowes them throughout. Therefore <hi>David (Pſal.</hi> 139.) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpoken much to this poynt of the Exactnes of Gods knowledge, concludes at the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe; <hi>Such knowledge is too wonderfull for mee, it is high I cannot attaine unto it.</hi> Some expound this Text, not of the knowledge of God concerning us, but of our knowledge concerning God. <hi>Thy knowledge or the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thee is too wonderfull for mee, I cannot attaine unto it.</hi> Others thus; <hi>This thy knowledge</hi> (namely that which he had
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:153845:76"/> before deſcribed) <hi>is more wonderfull</hi> (or more exact) <hi>then that I ſhould be able to deceive it.</hi> We may impoſe upon and deceive the moſt knowing man, but wee cannot impoſe upon or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive God. I conceave our reading to be moſt ſutable both to the Text and context. <hi>Such knowledge,</hi> that is, Such know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as thou haſt of mee, of the leaſt and greateſt things, even of all things that I or any man doth, is too wonderfull for mee. For though we may know ſome actions of men, yet wee cannot know them all, and wee can hardly weigh any of them to the utmoſt. And in this acknowledgement wee may take notice of the Pſalmiſt modeſty, who though he had the immediate aſſiſtance of a Propheticall Spirit, yet confeſſed, that he was not only not able to know God, but not to know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, his thoughts, words, and wayes, as God knew them. Such knowledge of my ſelfe as thou O Lord haſt of me, is <hi>too won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull for me, I cannot attaine unio it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some perhaps may querie upon this, if the Lord knoweth all the wayes of men, and pondereth all their actions, is not this a trouble to God? is not this a diſturbance of his peace, and a diſtraction to him?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer (as I ſaid before) this is to frame a God like our ſelves, for to him that is omniſcient, it is all one to know all, and to know but one thing: it is no more diſtraction, no more trouble to God to know all that we doe ſpeak, or thinke, then to know any thing. If two or three ſpeake to a man together, he is not able to take in their ſence, the variety of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe makes ſuch a hurry and trouble in his ſpirits, that he looſeth all that is ſpoken. But the application of thouſands or of Millions at the ſame time in ſpeaking to the eare of God, is no more trouble, then if but one did ſpeake; an infinite eare heares all, and an infinite eye ſees all, without any the leaſt diſtraction; the infinite knowledge of God takes in all the actions of all men, as eaſily as the ſingle action of any one man.</p>
                  <p>Againe, Others may ſay, Surely the Lord will not take ſuch exact knowledge of all the actions of men, eſpecially of mean men, or ſurely not of the meane actions of meaneſt men; poſſibly of ſome perſons in great place, &amp; of ſome great things done by thoſe perſons hee may take notice, but to ſtoope to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:153845:77"/> ſmall things, if it be not a trouble, yet it cannot but be a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to, and too great a Condeſcention for the great God. The Heathens ſayd their <hi>Jupiter</hi> had no leyſure to deale in ſmall matters;<note place="margin">Non vacat exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis rebus <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> And may not we Chriſtians ſay, It is not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable enough for our God, to have to doe with ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer; This alſo is to frame a God like our ſelves; as it doth not weary God to behold, to try and ponder all the wayes of all men (which was the feare concerning <hi>Moſes</hi> that hee ſhould be tyred out with the various caſes and affaires of that great People; and was therefore adviſed by <hi>Jethro</hi> to make more Judges, that ſo the weightier matters onely might be brought before and Judged by him) So it is no diſhonour at all to God, no, it is his honour that he takes cogniſance of the ſmalleſt matters as well as of the greateſt, of the loweſt as well as of the higheſt concernments of the children of men. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 113.5, 6.) <hi>Who is like unto the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high? who humbleth himſelfe to behold the things which are in Heaven, and in the Earth.</hi> Who is like to God in this? this is the honour of the high God that he will humble himſelfe to behold the loweſt things, the things which are in the Earth, as well as things in Heaven, and the leſſer, the leaſt things in earth, as well as the greater or the greateſt. <hi>Though the Lord be high, yet he humbleth himſelfe unto the lowly</hi> (Pſal. 138.6.) and as to <hi>lowly perſons,</hi> ſo to the <hi>loweſt things.</hi> Indeed the Lord doth humble himſelfe to behold the things which are in Heaven, it is a Condeſcention in him to take notice of any creature; yet he doth not onely humble himſelfe to behold things in Heaven, but things in the Earth, and in this who is like unto the Lord our God? this is his glory, and for this he is to be glorified, yea to be cryed up with this admiring Elogium, <hi>Who is like unto the Lord our God?</hi> None among the ſons of men are like him in this, yea there is no God like unto the Lord our God in this. Wee have cauſe to ſay (conſidering our vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes) <hi>What is man that thou ſhouldſt take notice of him?</hi> 'Tis too Great an honour for man, but it is no diſhonour to God to take notice of the meaneſt man. The greatnes of God appeares as in the making, ſo in the governing and diſpoſing of the ſmalleſt things. The power of God is ſeene in making a fly
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:153845:77"/> or a worme, as well as in making an Elephant or the vaſt Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan; So alſo is his wiſdome and providence ſeene in the obſerving and ordering of thoſe buſineſſes and motions of the creature, which compared to others are but as a fly to an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, or but as a worme to <hi>Leviathan.</hi> There is nothing doth more detract from the greatnes of God, then the denyall or diſ-beleefe of his cogniſance of and care about little things. And as it ſhewes the exacteſt perfection of holynes attaynable by man in this life, when he taketh an account of and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves himſelfe for the leaſt ſins, whether they be omiſſions of that good which he is commanded to doe, or commiſſions of that evill which he is forbidden to doe. So it is an undenya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble argument of the exactly and abſolutely perfect holynes, juſtice, goodnes and faithfulnes of God, that he taketh an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of, and will certainly reward or puniſh every man for the leaſt good or evill which he hath done. This is the glory of him who walketh in the circuit of heaven, that he ſees all to the center of the earth. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> having thus detected and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved (as he thought) thoſe thoughts and aſſertions of <hi>Job</hi> which detracted ſo much from God, as if he did not marke the wayes of men; proceeds to put the queſtion to him, whether himſelfe had well marked the wayes of wicked men.</p>

                     </note> the words which we render, <hi>Haſt thou marked,</hi> may be Expounded thus; <hi>Haſt thou taken up the old way?</hi> art thou a follower of that Sect, of that Tribe who have gone in that wicked way? doeſt thou alſo maintaine their blaſphemy, that God takes no notice of man? This notion holds faire with what he had ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As it may be referred to thoſe abominable A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſticall opinions which raigned in thoſe times, ſo to the wicked Practices, to the old Cuſtomes and ſinfull Courſes which were followed in thoſe times; for where a wicked opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is lodged in the heart, what kinde of wickednes is there that they may not breake forth in the life? And ſo here <hi>the old way</hi> is the way of ſinne, the corrupt Courſe and practices of that debauched generation, eſpecially the way of pride and ambition, which appeared much in the titles given them, <hi>Mighty men, men of name,</hi> or as we render, <hi>Men of renowne.</hi> They were men of honour and name with men, but we read not of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:153845:79"/> any honour they did to or received from God. It is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſgrace, to be memorable for actings againſt grace, or for ungracious actings.</p>

                     </note>Againe, The old way may be taken for the way of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or for that courſe of divine Juſtice which was Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon wicked men in thoſe elder times. There is away of Judgement which God takes, as there is a way of Sinne which man takes. Sinfull ways lead into troubleſome ways, &amp; end in death. Haſt thou conſidered the way of juſtice which the Lord went in towards thoſe old Sinners? powring out his wrath, and emptying the vialls of his Indignation upon them, till hee had conſumed and ſwept them off as rubbiſh from the face of the earth. <hi>Haſt thou marked the old way,</hi> which eyther the luſts of wicked men have led them into, or which the juſtice of the Lord hath brought them into. <hi>Haſt thou obſerved the old way?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Which wicked men have troden?</q>
                  <p>The Hebrew is, <hi>Men of Iniquity;</hi> Which phraſe plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that he doth not ſpeake of the ordinary race, or ranke of ſinners, but of the Extreameſt ſinners, men ſo full of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, that they deſerved this blacke Title, <hi>men of Iniquity.</hi> Antichriſt is called not onely <hi>a man of ſin,</hi> or <hi>the man of ſin,</hi> but (which implyeth a ſinner of a higher forme, then both the former) <hi>That man of ſin</hi> (2 Theſ. 2.3.) He being indeed not onely among the chiefeſt ſinners, but the chiefe of ſinners. The phraſe in the Text is a degree lower then that, yet it notes a very great degreee. And therefore when the Prophet would aſſure the greateſt ſinners repenting and returning to God, of the readines of God to pardon, he expreſſeth them in this ſtile (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7.) <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man,</hi> or (as the Original Text hath it) <hi>the man of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, his thoughts and</hi> &amp;c. As <hi>a man of Bloods</hi> notes a very bloody man, a man given up to that particular ſin of cruelty. So <hi>a man of iniquity,</hi> is one given up to ſin in Generall. Haſt thou marked the old way which wicked men, men of iniquity, have
<q>Trodden.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This word, <hi>trodden,</hi> referred both to a ſinfull and a ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way, notes the frequency of their going or being in thoſe
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:153845:79"/> wayes. And as it is referred to their ſinfull way alone, it notes firſt their boldneſſe in ſinning; ſecondly, their reſolvedneſſe to ſin: A trodden way, is ſuch a way as a man hath often gone, and in which he is not afraid to goe. <hi>Haſt thou marked the old way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note. Firſt,
<q>The way of Sin and Error is an old way.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Devill ſinned from the beginning, and men have ſinned from their beginning, not onely have there been ſinnings, but great ſinnings from the begining; the old way is the way of ſin, though the oldeſt way be not. There was holines before there was ſinne, and truth before there was Error; So that the way of ſinne is the old way, but not the oldeſt way. God, all whoſe wayes are holy, was from everlaſting. The Angels who have been holy as long as they have been, were from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. And the firſt beginning of man in his converſation, was, no doubt, like his conſtitution, holy. He quickly went out of the way, but ſurely his firſt ſtep was not out of the way, he went right before he went wrong, and ſtood before he fell. Againe, if you take the way for the way of puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>That God in all ages hath puniſhed ſinners in their ſinfull wayes.</q>
                  <p>God hath every where and every when left the tract and print of his anger and diſpleaſure upon ſinners; though ſome particular ſinners, have gone unpuniſhed in ſome age, yet there was never any age wherein ſinne was not puniſhed in ſome. The Lord gives a morall ſtopp to ſinne perpetually, that is, by his Lawes he declares againſt it, his word is expreſſe againſt all ungodlynes, both the word of his Command, and the word of his threatning. Now as the Lord doth alwayes put this morall ſtopp in the way of ſinne, ſo, he often puts a Judiciary ſtopp, or a ſtop by way of Judgement. And as in the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> he ſet a flaming ſword in the way of the tree of life, ſo he continually ſets a flaming word, that is, a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to keepe the way of the tree of death, that is, of ſinne. Thus he alwayes meetes ſinfull men in the way of their luſts (as the Angel met <hi>Balaam</hi> when he went to curſe the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:153845:80"/> God) with a drawne ſword to ſtopp them in their way; the Lord hath ſet many drawne ſwords in the way of every ſinne; and he hath left the prints of his wrath upon the backs of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinners, that wee ſhould take heed of ſinning. The Lord hath left many ſad examples upon record againſt ſinne, nor hath he at any time favoured it, or done any thing which might indeed encourage ſinners; for though ſometimes wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men have proſper'd, yet, ſhould wee looke into all times, wee cannot finde that wicked men were ever bleſſed; Judgement hath overtaken them ſooner or later. And if it hath at any time come too late to overtake them in this world, yet it will come ſoone enough to overtake theirs in this, or themſelves in the world which is to come. No man is bleſſed, at any time, who comes at laſt to be miſerable.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In that he ſaith; <hi>Haſt thou marked the old way?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>It is our duty to obſerve and marke, as the way of ſinfull men, ſo the way in which God puniſheth their ſinne.</q>
                  <p>All the wayes of God are to be marked; as wee are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what the Lord ſpeakes, ſo what he doth; his works as well as his word, are remarkeable. <hi>Who ſo is wiſe</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.43.) <hi>and will obſerve theſe things, even they ſhall underſtand the loving kindnes of the Lord.</hi> I may ſay alſo, that they ſhall underſtand the judgements of the Lord. And againe, the Prophet confirmes it (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.9.) <hi>Who is wiſe and he ſhall underſtand theſe things prudent and he ſhall know them; for the wayes of the Lord are right, and the Juſt ſhall walke in them, but the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors ſhall fall therein.</hi> The wicked fall in the way of his commandements, and therefore ſurely they ſhall fall in the way of his judgements. And as the Lord hath given us Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this, ſo he hath given this as the uſe of thoſe Examples that wee ſhould marke and obſerve them. The Apoſtle (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.) ſhewes that all the dealings of God with that his anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent People the <hi>Jewes,</hi> are written and recorded as our Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples (<hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6, 7.) <hi>With many of them God was not well pleaſed, but they were overthrowne in the wilderneſs. Now theſe things were our Examples, to the Intent that wee ſhould not luſt after evill things as they luſted, neither be Idolaters, as ſome of them were, nor fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:153845:80"/> nor tempt Chriſt, nor murmure,</hi> &amp;c. He ſhuts up all with the ſame doctrine (<hi>ver.</hi> 11.) <hi>Now all theſe things happened unto them for Enſamples, and are written for our admonition, upon whom the Ends of the Earth are come, therefore let him that ſtandeth take heed leaſt hee fall.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> alſo (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.) brings in; firſt, the inſtance of the Angells that fell; ſecondly, of the old world; thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rſt, for imitation; ſecondly, for caution; The lapſed Angels, the old world, theſe Cities <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> are all left as Enſamples for caution, that all after ages mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the old way of their ſinne and puniſhment, might feare to ſinne and ſuffer as they have done.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, From the manner of this Expreſſion <hi>(which wicked men have troden)</hi> taking the way conjunctively for the way both of ſinne and puniſhment, this troddennes of it notes the frequent paſſage which many have made through it; They have not gone it once onely but often. Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>As wicked men offend often, ſo the Lord hath puniſhed often, as they have made pathes in ſinne, ſo God hath made pathes in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
                  <p>It is eaſie to follow ſinners (as it were) by the print and tract of thoſe evills which have overtaken them. But I paſſe it here, becauſe <hi>Eliphaz</hi> proceeds more directly to deſcribe the puniſhment of wicked men in the next words.</p>

                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>
                        <hi>That,</hi> God can quickly make an End of wicked men.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hee needs not take any long time to doe it; hee tooke but very little time to make the world, it was made in ſix dayes, which in reference to the greatneſs of the worke is no time: when a great thing is done in a little time, wee may ſay it was done without any time at all. Now if the Lord could frame a world without time, ſurely he can cut downe the world, or the inhabitants of it in a little time? <hi>Ruining worke, is eaſier then building worke.</hi> He that built (in this ſence) without time, can pull downe without time; wee need not trouble our ſelves with ſuch thoughts as theſe, when wee ſee wicked men, Enemies of God and his people in their height and ſtrength, O what a length of time will it require? O how many yeares muſt be ſpent in cutting downe theſe ſtrong Oakes, thoſe tall Cedars? the Lord can cut them downe in a moment. Our late experinces have ſhewed us wicked men cut downe without time; before they thought they could be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, yea toucht, they have be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n cut downe; when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded they could not be reached, they have been ruined. The
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:153845:82"/> Jeſuites and other Matchavillian politicians have a received Maxime of State among them; <hi>Take time and you may doe any thing.</hi> If you are diſappointed in a project this yeare, waite a few yeares longer (ſay they) and you ſhall eyther finde or make a way to accompliſh it. But the Lord can doe any thing he hath a minde to at any time, or without taking time. The Apoſtle prophecying of the Antichriſt ſaith (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.6, 7.) <hi>Now ye know what withholdeth, that he may he revealed in his time; for the myſtery of iniquity doth already worke, onely he who now let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth will let, till he be taken out of the way.</hi> The power and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of the Romane Empire ſtood in Antichriſts way, and he could not cut it downe without time; He was hacking and hewing, heaving and thruſting many yeares, yea ſome ages before he could remove that blocke out of his way, and ſo make way for his owne Greatnes. The wiſeſt of men muſt have time to bring about their ends. Onely God, the onely wiſe God, can cut downe and remove whatſoever ſtands in his way (though it ſtand like a great mountaine) without time or without taking time, if once his time be come in which he would have it removed. The wicked of thoſe elder times were cut downe ſuddenly, without time. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> confirmes it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the next words.</p>
                  <q>Whoſe foundation was overflowne with a flood.</q>
                  <p>In this latter clauſe <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſeemes more clearly to hint at ſome particular wicked men, or to ſhew who thoſe wicked men were that hee Intends as the object of his obſervation, namely, thoſe, <hi>whoſe foundation was overflowne with a flood.</hi> It is uſuall in Scripture, by ſome one word to alude to great acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and changes paſt. Take two or three Inſtances for Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of this; (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.15.) <hi>David</hi> Imprecates vengeance upon his enemies in this Language; <hi>Let them goe downe quick into hell.</hi> Which expreſſion carrieth a plaine alluſion unto that dreadfull judgement. (<hi>Numb.</hi> 16.31, 32.) <hi>It came to paſſe as hee</hi> (that is, <hi>Moſes) had made an End of ſpeaking all theſe words, the ground clave aſunder that was under them; and the earth opened her mouth and ſwallowed them up and their houſes, and all the men which appertained unto Corah, and all their goods. They and all that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to them went downe alive into the pit,</hi> &amp;c. This hiſtoricall
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:153845:83"/> Narration the Pſalmiſt hints at in his imprecation, as is plaine by that word <hi>quick</hi> or <hi>alive; Let them goe downe quick</hi> (or alive) <hi>into hell;</hi> that is, let ſuch wrath ſeaze upon them, as ſeazed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> on whom <hi>the earth cloſed and they periſhed from among the Congregation.</hi> Againe, when the Apoſtle makes promiſe to Saints in the behalfe of Chriſt what aſſiſtance they might expect from him in time of temptation, and what iſſue from it, he thus aſſures them; <hi>The God of peace ſhall tread Satan under your feete ſhortly,</hi> (Rom. 16.20.) Which plainly beares upon that firſt grand Promiſe, that <hi>(Chriſt) the ſeede of the Woman ſhould breake the Serpents head</hi> (Gen. 3.15.) for it is by vertue of that act of Jeſus Chriſt bruiſing the head of Satan, that Satan is troden under our feet. As Chriſt bruiſed him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his owne feete, ſo hee will bruiſe, or tread him under out feete; the ſeede of the woman in perſon, as well as in their repreſentative, ſhall breake the Serpents head. Laſtly, thoſe words (<hi>Rom.</hi> 9.16.) hold a cleare correſpondence with that Story (<hi>Gen.</hi> 27.) concerning <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau, So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy.</hi> Hee had ſayd before that <hi>God loved Jacob and hated Eſau;</hi> and concludes upon it, <hi>So then, it is not of him that willeth,</hi> &amp;c. Wee may take notice in that famous peice of the divine Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that much meanes was uſed that <hi>Jacob</hi> might obtaine the Bleſſing; <hi>Rebecca</hi> her heart was ſet upon it; ſhee did what ſhee could to procure the Bleſſing for her younger Sonne, her will was wholy in it; and <hi>Jacob,</hi> hee run for it too; for as ſoone as Ever his mother had given him counſell, he ran preſently to the flock and brought in a Kid to make the ſavoury meat for <hi>Iſaac;</hi> Now, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to advance the freenes of grace, doth not only inſtance in thoſe two perſons, but uſeth a phraſe of ſpeech which ſavours ſo much of that paſſage, that though he had not named the men, yet every man who knew the Scriptures muſt needs underſtand both of whom and of what he meant it; <hi>It is not of him that willeth,</hi> &amp;c. that is, it was neyther <hi>Rebeckaes</hi> will to have it ſo, nor <hi>Jacobs</hi> haſt (which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in his running to the flock) to have it ſo, that gave him the Bleſſing, but it was of God that ſhewed mercy. And as it was then, ſo it is now, though a man be as willing as <hi>Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kah,</hi> or though he make as much ſpeed as <hi>Jacob</hi> for his bleſſing,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:153845:83"/> yet all comes freely by the grace of God. Thus the frequent uſage of Scripture ſhewes us how much the Spirit of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to lead our thoughts (by the light of ſome one word) a great way back into the conſideration of what hath been done and written of old for our inſtruction. The words of the text now under diſcuſſion, <hi>(Whoſe foundation was overflowne with a flood)</hi> are ſurely an alluſion to ſome particular perſons or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the dayes of old, and they may be applyed three wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To the drowning of the whole world in the time of <hi>Noah</hi> by a flood, when the Lord opened the windowes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and overwhelmed both man and beaſt in thoſe mighty waters; which univerſal judgement is (by way of eminence) called, <hi>The Deluge,</hi> or, <hi>The Flood,</hi> unto this very day.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They may have reſpect to the overthrow of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> which Cities, though they were deſtroyed by fire, yet it was with a flood of fire. The Text ſaith expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (<hi>Gen.</hi> 19.24.) <hi>Then the Lord rayned upon Sodome and upon Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah brimſtone and fire from the Lord out of heaven, and he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the Cities &amp; all the plaine,</hi> &amp;c. They were overflowne with a flood of fire.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Hunc locum a v. <hi>15.</hi> ad v <hi>20.</hi> omnino reſpicere ad dimerſionem Pharaones &amp; Egyptiorum non levibus ſuadeor conjecturis. <hi>Pined:</hi>
                     </note> The alluſion may be carried to the deſtruction of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in the red Sea; They alſo <hi>were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowne with a flood.</hi> The waters of the red Sea which ſtood up as a wall for <hi>Iſraell</hi> to paſſe thorow, at the Command of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning upon the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> ſwallowed them up, them and their Chariots and their horſes. <hi>The enemy ſayd</hi> (thus <hi>Moſes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes that fatal overthrow (<hi>Exod.</hi> 15.9, 10.) <hi>I will purſue, I will overtake, I will divide the ſpoyle: my luſt ſhall be ſatisfied upon them, I will draw my ſword, my hand ſhall deſtroy them.</hi> Thus the enemy raged &amp; foamed with revenge, like a tempeſtuous Sea, and had opened all the ſluces of his will to overflow them. And when the enemy had thus breathed out his wrath in a foure times repeated, <hi>I will;</hi> Then the <hi>Lord did blow with his wind, the Sea covered them, They ſanke as lead in the mighty wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> So then the words may relate to any of thoſe three ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Judgements, to the drowning of the old world with a flood of water, to the deſtruction of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> with a flood of fire, or to the overthrow of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his <hi>Egyptian</hi> hoſt in the red Sea.</p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:153845:84"/>
                  <p>But more particularly, for the explication of theſe words; <hi>whoſe foundation was overflowne with a flood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Whoſe foundation.</q>
                  <p>This word <hi>foundation</hi> taken in a proper ſence, referres to a materiall building. And the foundation of any building is the ſtability and ſtrength of it; by <hi>foundation,</hi> in a metaphorical ſence,<note place="margin">Ea omnia quae illis velur fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damenti loco e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, in quibus ſpem &amp; praeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium ponebant, &amp;c. <hi>Merc:</hi>
                     </note> wee are to underſtand all thoſe things by which the ſtate of perſons or things is upheld; and here whatſoever wicked men ſupport &amp; beare up themſelves by, as a building is borne up by the foundation, is to be underſtood as their foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So their power, their riches, their councell, their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, their friends and confederates; whatſoever, I ſay, is the ſupport of their worldly State, that's their foundation. And thus it is here ſaid, <hi>their foundation was overflowne</hi>
                     <q>With a flood.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In two of the former Inſtances, to which the alluſion was made, their foundation was overflowne by a flood properly taken. If wee take it more generally for all wicked men, who at any time have been overthrowne, wee may ſay, that they have all been overflowne by a flood metaphorically. For ſo</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The diſpleaſure of God, by what meanes or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſoever put forth is called a flood; whether is be by ſword, or by famine, or by peſtilence, it is a flood. (<hi>Eſa.</hi> 8.7.) Wee read warre Compared to a flood; <hi>Now therefore behold the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, ſtrong and many</hi> (what were theſe waters?) <hi>Even the King of Aſſyria, and all his glory;</hi> the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> with his Armyes, in which he glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or which he counted his glory, were the waters of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſtrong and many) <hi>and hee ſhall come up over all his channells, and goe over all his hands</hi> (that is, the former Limits of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion) <hi>And he ſhall paſſe thorow Judah, hee ſhall overflow and goe over.</hi> There The Sword is Compared to a flood, or to a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty river, which beares downe all before it. The ſame Prophet ſpeakes againe in the ſame Language (<hi>Eſa.</hi> 59.19.) <hi>When the enemy ſhall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord ſhall lift up a Standard againſt him;</hi> as if it had been ſaid, <hi>The enemy ſhall come ruſhing in like a mighty torrent but the Spirit of God, like a more migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:153845:84"/> winde, ſhall blow and ruſh upon him,</hi> cauſing him to recoile and give back, or (as our Margent hath it) <hi>put him to flight.</hi> Againe (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.) The Prophet foreſhewes the approaching cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity upon thoſe who had ſeduced the <hi>Jewes</hi> into a vaine ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; which is there called, <hi>the building of a wall with untem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered morter.</hi> A wall he calls that prophecy, becauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſafety, and defence; but he calls it alſo a wall built with untempered morter, becauſe that falſe prophecy was a weake prophecy, and ſhould ſhortly fall. The manner how, he gives us in the notion of the Text (<hi>verſ.</hi> 13.) <hi>Wherefore thus ſaith the Lord God, I will even rent it with a ſtormy winde in my fury, and there ſhall be as an overflowing ſhower in mine anger,</hi> &amp;c. that is, wrath ſhall be upon it (the Babylonian Army was the ſpecial judgement in which that wrath was expreſſed) and that <hi>ſhall be as an overflowing ſhower.</hi> Great and continuall ſhowers will try the ſtrongeſt buildings, and quickly overthrow the weake. A wall of untempered morter is no match for a ſtorme. As our Saviour alſo aſſures us in the cloſe of his Sermon on the Mount, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 7.27.) where all thoſe evills, troubles, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, ſorrowes, and perſecutions, whether ſent upon ſuch as are really godly, or onely in name and outward profeſſion, are called <hi>raine, floods, winds.</hi> So ſaith the Text, <hi>The raine deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon the houſe and it fell, and great was the fall of it.</hi> While it ſtood, it ſtood to no purpoſe but for a ſhew, but when it fell, it fell to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>The fall thereof was great.</hi> Thus it is more then evident from Scripture phraſe, that raines and floods ſignifie all ſorts of afflicting evils, and therefore we need not reſtraine the word <hi>flood</hi> in the Text to a Deluge of Elementary water, or of water in a proper ſence, but wee may Enlarge it to any kinde of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting Evill or trouble whatſoever that falls upon man. And the Scripture is (I conceave) ſo frequent in the uſe of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor of a flood, and of waters, where great calamities are ſet forth, for theſe two reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To note the ſwiftnes and ſuddennes of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God. Floods come often very ſuddenly, and riſe not onely beyond expectation, but before there is any the leaſt expectation of them. <hi>Noahs</hi> flood was long foretold before it came, but when the time came, wherein it ſhould come, it came
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:153845:85"/> at once. Though God give long warning of his judgements, yet moſt men are ſurpriz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d with them, they come like a flood.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To note the Irreſiſtablenes of the Judgements of God; who or what can ſtand before mighty waters? Great floods doe not onely waſh and overflow all, but ruine and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow all, there's no reſiſting. Such are the Judgements of God, they are a flood both for their ſuddain riſing and breaking in upon ſinners, and likewiſe for their Irreſiſtible violence in breaking and ruining them.</p>
                  <p>Further, It is not to be paſſed by, That <hi>Eliphaz</hi> doth not onely ſay, They were <hi>overflowne,</hi> but, <hi>Their foundation was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowne with a flood.</hi> He calls it the overflowing of their founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to note, that they were totally or utterly ruined &amp; over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne: for when the foundation is deſtroyed, all is deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; deſtruction to the foundation is the worſt of deſtructions. The cruel enemies of the <hi>Jewes</hi> cryed, <hi>Raſe it, raſe it even to the foundation thereof</hi> (Pſ. 137.7.) but to raſe the foundation it ſelfe is more cruel then raſing to the foundation. When the Lord threatned a full and final deſtruction of thoſe fooliſh Prophets who had ſeene vaine viſions for his people, he ſayd (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.14) <hi>I will breake downe the wall that ye have daubed with untempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red morter, and bring it downe to the ground, ſo that the foundation thereof ſhall be diſcovered,</hi> &amp;c. That is, I will deſtroy it as farre as deſtruction it ſelfe can goe. There ſhall not only not a ſtone be left upon a ſtone of this building above ground, but even the under-ground ſtones ſhall not be left. The very foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall be opened and diſcovered. That which lyeth at the bottome, or the bottome it ſelfe of thoſe flattering prophecies, all the wiles &amp; ſecret way<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of them ſhalbe revealed. <hi>David</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines of thoſe irreparable breaches made upon the civill ſtate in this ſtile (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.3.) <hi>If the foundations be deſtroyed, what can the righteous doe?</hi> The civill foundation of a Nation or people, is their Lawes, and Conſtitutions, the order and power that is among them, that's the foundation of a People, and when once this foundation is deſtroyed, <hi>what can the righteous doe?</hi> what can the beſt, the wiſeſt in the world doe in ſuch a caſe? what can any man doe, if there be not a foundation of Government left among men? There is no helpe nor anſwer in ſuch a caſe, but that which followes in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of the ſame Pſalme;
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:153845:85"/> 
                     <hi>The Lord is in his holy Temple, the Lords throane is in heaven, his eyes behold, his eyelids try the children of men.</hi> As if he had ſayd; in the midſt of theſe confuſions, when as it is ſayd (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.5.) <hi>All the foundations of the earth are out of courſe;</hi> yet God keepes his courſe ſtill, he is where he was and as he was, without va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riablenes or ſhadow of turning. Wee read in the viſion of the fower Monarchyes (<hi>Dan.</hi> 2.34.) That <hi>The ſtone Cut out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hands ſmote the Image upon his feete that were of Iron and Clay, and brake them to peeces:</hi> The ſtone did not ſtrike the Image up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head, or upon the breaſt, the golden head, the ſilver breaſt, &amp;c. but upon the feete that were of Iron and Clay. Now the feete are to a naturall body, as the foundation is to an Artificiall body; A mans feete are the foundation of his body; if the feete be ſmitten and broken to pieces, the body muſt needs fall. And therefore as ſoone as ever it was ſayd, That the Stone <hi>brake the feete to peices,</hi> The ruine of the whole Image is deſcribed in the immediately following words of the viſion (<hi>ver.</hi> 35.) <hi>Then was the Iron, the Clay, the braſs, the ſilver, and the gold broken to peices together, and became like the chaffe of the Summer threſhing floore, and the winde carried them away, that no place was found for them.</hi> The breaking of the feete, was the breaking up of the foundation, and ſo the <hi>breaking downe of all. Whoſe foundation was overflowne with a flood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Wicked men thinke themſelves very ſure, they have foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, they lay foundations.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The people of God are ſometimes over-conceited about the ſtrength and ſtability of their worldly foundations. Holy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſayd, <hi>In his proſperity, I ſhall never be moved, Lord by thy favour thou haſt made my mountaine to ſtand ſtrong,</hi> (Pſal. 30.6, 7.) And if a godly man may, by the ſtrength of temptation, thus over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reckon the ſtrength of an Earthly ſtate, what may they doe whoſe ſtate, yea whoſe minds are altogether earthly? How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten doe they judge themſelves wiſe and politique enough to lay for themſelves an everlaſting foundation in things which cannot laſt? and that they are ſo ſurely bottom'd in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of men, that they <hi>ſhall never be removed. Babylon</hi> thinks her ſelfe ſetled at this day upon ſuch everlaſting mountaines,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:153845:86"/> upon ſuch perpetuall hills of power and policy, that certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly her foundation ſhall never be overflowne. Thus ſhee ſpake her heart out, while <hi>ſhee ſayd in her heart</hi> (Rev. 18.7.) <hi>I ſit a Queene, and am no widdow, and ſhall ſee no ſorrow.</hi> Babylon is bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom'd &amp; foundation'd upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo many hils, that is, upon ſo many Intereſts &amp; advantages of ſtrength, as render her (to her ſelfe) impregnable and unremoveable. And as this vaine confidence beares up the Spirit of that Man of ſin, ſo of very many ſinfull men, who preſume they are upon a ſure foundation, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed none but the godly mans foundation is ſure. (<hi>Prov.</hi> 10.25.) <hi>As the whirlewinde paſſeth, ſo is the wicked no more, but the righteous is an everlaſting foundation.</hi> The wicked man ſuppoſeth himſelfe founded as on a Rock of ages an everlaſting ſtrength, ſuch as the righteous man hath in God, or ſuch as God is to a righteous man. (<hi>Eſay</hi> 26.3.) <hi>Yet as the whirlewinde bee paſſeth away but the righteous is an everlaſting foundation.</hi> Wee finde not the Copulative word, <hi>is,</hi> expreſſed in the Hebrew, there 'tis onely, <hi>but the righteous an Everlaſting foundation;</hi> So that I ſhould rather read it thus; <hi>But the righteous have an everlaſting foundation:</hi> wicked men ſeeme to have, but the righteous man indeed <hi>hath an Everlaſting foundation.</hi> There is no earthly foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation everlaſting; For all earthly things paſſe away, and are fo farre from laſting for ever, that they laſt but (as it were) for a little, for a moment. What then is this everlaſting foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation? It is a foundation layd in heavenly things; The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation which is layd in things above ſhall abide; The things which are not ſeene, and they onely, are eternal (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18.) but the ſtrongeſt foundation layd in things below, endures but for a <hi>ſeaſon; The things which are ſeene, are temporal,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeakes in the ſame place.

A wicked man is in greateſt danger when he thinkes himſelfe in greateſt ſafety, and then moſt ready to fall when he ſayth in his owne heart, or boaſteth it out to others, that he is upon a ſure foundation; For whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver opinion he hath of it; yet the truth is, his foundation is but ſand; and (which makes his caſe more miſerable) though he be told ſo, and others have found it ſo, yet he will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it. While (as the Prophet ſpeakes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.20.) <hi>He feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of aſhes, a deceaved heart hath turned him aſide, that be cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his ſoule, nor ſay is there not a lye, or</hi> (as the former Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath it.) <hi>a refuge of lyes in my right hand.</hi> Only <hi>the righteous is, or hath</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes) <hi>an everlaſting foundation.</hi> A righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man hath two foundations which ſhall never be ſhaken, much leſſe overthrowne; who ſo are ſetled on thoſe founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be as confident as confidence it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe two foundations is Gods Eternall Decree, his Decree of Election, that's an unmoveable foundation, and that is the foundation upon which beleevers build their hopes. The Apoſtle (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19, 20.) is proving that even in the houſe of God, that is, among the outward profeſſors of the name of God, there are of all ſorts, veſſells of gold and ſilver, veſſells alſo of wood and of Earth; <hi>Some to honour, and ſome to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;</hi> and when he had ſaid of <hi>Himeneus and Philetus, that they had erred concerning the truth, ſaying that the reſurrection is paſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and ſo had overthrowne the faith of ſome,</hi> verſ. 18. Hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently adds, What though it be thus, what though ſome men have fallen from their foundation, <hi>yet the foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this Seale, The Lord knoweth who are his,</hi> verſ. 19. Where we have firſt the foundation of God, namely, his decree of Election; Secondly, the Seale or aſſurance of it, as to him, even his owne certain knowledge of the Elect, <hi>The Lord knoweth who are his.</hi> So that while hypocrites or meere verbal formal profeſſors back-ſlide and Apoſtatize from the faith, yet the Elect are ſafe and ſtand faſt in the purpoſe of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:153845:87"/> God; and while many diſcover themſelves to be veſſels of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour in the houſe of God, wood and Earth, of baſe and britle materials; yet Saints, indeed, who are veſſels of honour made of pureſt metal, of Gold and Silver, theſe ſhall abide for ever. He that is once a veſſel of honour, ſhall alwayes be ſo; <hi>For the foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this Seale, The Lord knoweth who are his.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, As there is this more hidden foundation, upon which Saints are ſure, and which no flood can overflow; ſo there is another ſure foundation, and that is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> upon which Saints are built, and therefore the holy Prophet having diſcovered that refuge of lyes which he threatens ſhould be ſwept away by the overflowing ſcourge, ſubjoynes by way of Oppoſition in the next verſe (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.16.) <hi>Therefore thus ſayth the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Sion for a foundation a ſtone, a tryed ſtone, a precious corner ſtone, a ſure foundation, and he that beleeveth ſhall not make haſt.</hi> Whom the Prophet means by this ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, the Apoſtle tells us expreſſely and by name (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11.) <hi>Other foundation can no man lay then that which is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and they that are built on him the living Rock (as all Beleevers are) have eternal life, and ſhall never periſh. This Chriſt himſelfe teacheth us (<hi>Matth.</hi> 7.24, 25.) <hi>Who ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beareth theſe ſayings of mine and doth them, I will liken him to a wiſe man that built his houſe upon a Rock.</hi> And what's the Rock that theſe wife men build upon? This rock is Jeſus Chriſt, hee is the rock of Ages; Hee fayles not, nor can they fall who are in him; as it followeth; <hi>Then the raine deſcended, the floods came, the winds blew and beat upon the houſe, and it fell not, for it was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on a rock.</hi> Saints are <hi>lively ſtones,</hi> and they <hi>comming to Chriſt</hi> (by faith) <hi>who is a living ſtone, diſſalowed indeed of men, but choſen of God and precious, are built up a ſpirituall houſe</hi> (1 Pet. 2.4, 5.) If this houſe ſhould fall, Chriſt muſt fall too, for though Chriſt and this houſe are diſtinguiſhed, yet they are not divided; Chriſt and this houſe are one; So then though the floods of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry men, &amp; of enraged Devils beate upon it, yet they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne foaming out their owne ſhame, &amp; when they have done their worſt, they ſhall but waſh this houſe, leaving it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more cleane, but no whit unſetled. This is the glory and priviledge of Beleevers, that while the ſtrongeſt foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:153845:87"/> of the Earth are overflowne with a flood, They have a twofold foundation, That of Election in the Love of God, and that of Redemption in the bloud of Chriſt, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be overflowne by any the moſt violent and impetuous flood.</p>
                  <p>So then, ungodly men are miſerable, when they appeare moſt happy, and at their beſt eſtate are altogether vanity; for eyther their eſtate hath no foundation, or but ſuch a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation as cannot ſtand, and that is as bad or rather worſe then none at all; It is better to have no appearance of ſtrength, then to have nothing but an appearance of it.</p>
                  <p>Further, may we not from the oppoſite ſtate of Godly men (at leaſt intimated in this, and toucht before) conclude, that they are happy when they appeare moſt miſerable? and that at their worſt eſtate, they are altogether above uncertainty? For as they have a foundation, ſo ſuch a foundation as will ſtand all ſtormes and weathers; What can be added to their felicity, who are in an eſtate ſo good (in the nature of it) that they need not deſire a change, and ſo ſure (in the foundation of it) that they need not feare a change, much leſſe an overflowing flood?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eliphaz</hi> proceeds to deſcribe the particular wickednes of thoſe men, or how they did Expreſſe their wickedneſſe; <hi>Whoſe foundation was thus overflowne; They ſay unto God depart from us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Theſe words are filled with the very ſpirit of malice againſt God himſelfe; And we have the ſame breathed out in the ſame language in the former Chapter at the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, there the reader may finde them explicated, and I ſhall add ſomewhat for a further explication here.</p>
                  <q>Which ſaid to God, depart from us.</q>
                  <p>To this hight of madnes doe ſome wicked men ariſe, their ſpirits being bigge with ſinne, they bring forth or belch out this monſter of words; <hi>They ſay to God, depart from us.</hi> They (as it were) ſend God a writ of Ejectment, they doe not pray or entreate God to depart from them, but with as much rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and incivillity as unholynes and prophanenes, <hi>Say unto God, depart from us.</hi> 'Tis a word of command, from man, but ſuch a one as breakes all the commandements of God. <hi>Moſes (Numb.</hi> 16.26.) beſeeches the people, ſaying, <hi>Depart I pray you from the tents of theſe wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs;</hi> but here we have wicked men not praying God to depart, but bidding him, <hi>they ſay depart from us. David</hi> ſpeakes to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.115.) <hi>Depart from me ye evill doers, for I will keepe the commandements of my God;</hi> he bids them begone, He would
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:153845:88"/> not give them the leaſt wellcome or entertainment. And ſo Jeſus Chriſt is deſcribed ſpeaking to the wicked in the day of Judgement, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 7.23.) <hi>Depart from me,</hi> away, get you out of my preſence, I will not have to doe with you, I will doe nothing for you; <hi>Depart.</hi> His is a word of command, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, which though they have no will to obey, yet they ſhall obey it whether they will or no. Thus in the preſent text wicked men preſume to ſay to God himſelfe, <hi>depart from us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That wicked or meere carnall men, have ſome appearances and impreſſes of the preſence of God upon their ſpirits.</q>
                  <p>They could not ſay to God, <hi>depart from us,</hi> had they not ſome impreſſions and notions of God, of the will and Law of God, of the truth and power of God upon them. They who are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, doe yet feele a preſence of God with them (<hi>Act.</hi> 17.27) <hi>That they ſhould ſeeke the Lord, if haply they might feele after him and finde him, though he be not farre from every one of us.</hi> Take mankind in generall, good and bad, beleevers and infidels, there is a neereneſſe of God unto them, unto them all: and that not onely a neereneſſe of God in what the Apoſtle there ſpeakes of, common preſervation (<hi>verſ.</hi> 28.) <hi>In him we live, and move, and have our being,</hi> or of naturall communications, of which the Apoſtle ſpeakes there alſo, <hi>From him we receave life, and breath, and all things (verſ.</hi> 25.) But further God is with them, by a twofold light; firſt, by a light of Direction; ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by a light of Conviction. All have a Light of direction, 1. by the Law written in their hearts. The Apoſtle is expreſſe for this (<hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14.) <hi>For when the Gentiles</hi> (he meanes it of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles unconverted) <hi>which have not the Law, doe by nature the things contained in the Law, theſe having not the Law</hi> (that is formally publiſhed and preached to them) <hi>are a Law unto them ſelves: Which ſhew the worke of the Law written in their hearts, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience alſo bearing witnes,</hi> &amp;c. And as all have a light of directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Law written in their hearts, or in the booke of Conſcience; ſo alſo 2. they have a light of direction from the Law of the creation, or from that which is written of God in
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:153845:89"/> the Booke of the creature. The ſame Apoſtle makes this the ground of the righteouſnes of God in that dreadfull <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his wrath againſt all ungodlynes and unrighteouſnes of men</hi> (be they who they will) <hi>who hold the truth in unrighteouſnes, becauſe that which may be knowne of God is manifest in them</hi> (or to them) <hi>for God hath ſhewed it to them.</hi> But how or where hath God ſhewed them this? The Apoſtle anſwers in the next verſe (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20.) <hi>For the inviſible things of him from the creation of the world are clearely ſeene, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead, ſo that they are without excuſe.</hi> So that, though all men have not a light of direction from God ſo powerfull as to change them and make them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet they have a light ſo cleare and full as is enough to make them guilty. And when they refuſe to follow this light of direction in doing what is right, then followes that other light of convictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, their conſciences troubling them, or (as the Apoſtles phraſe is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15.) their thoughts accuſing them, becauſe they have done that which is not right. This preſence of God is common to all men, to the worſt of men, and this is it which provokes them to <hi>ſay to God, depart from us.</hi> And this is argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t enough to ſtop the mouth of the Atheiſt, who ſaith in his heart, <hi>there is no God;</hi> when as yet he cannot ſtop the mouth of his owne conſcience from ſaying <hi>there is a God,</hi> while hee ſayth (and this he alwayes ſayth, eyther in plaine termes, or in that which is equivalent) <hi>to God depart from me.</hi> And from hence wee may obſerve;</p>
                  <p>Secondly;
<q>That the preſence, and manifeſtations of God to wicked men, are a trouble to them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>None are troubled with the neerenes of God to them, but they who are farre from him: all naturall men are farre from God in ſtate and in heart, and God is neere all naturall men eyther in his word or in his works, eyther ſpeaking his minde to their eares, or ſending it in to their conſciences. This light of God is not onely not pleaſing but vexing. They who love darknes cannot abide the light of direction, much leſſe the light of conviction; So that if ever God be <hi>neere in their mouth,</hi> neere in their eare, or neere in their conſcience, yet as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:153845:89"/> ſpeakes (<hi>Jer.</hi> 12.2.) <hi>He is farre from their reines;</hi> that is, though they ſpeake, heare or thinke of God, yet they delight not in him, they have no deſirings, no breathings after him, yea the more he offers himſelfe to them, the more weary are they of him. What <hi>David</hi> ſpake in a temptation, they ſpeake from their diſpoſition (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.3.) <hi>I remembred God and was troubled.</hi> It troubles them when they are put in minde of God, it troubles them when God comes into their minde. God is holy, and they are unholy, The holy God muſt needs be a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to an unholy heart. The Prophet puts the Queſtion (<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> 3.3.) <hi>Can two walke together except they be agreed?</hi> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. That company is alwayes unpleaſant to us, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable to us; They who are not at one, are beſt pleaſed when they are furtheſt aſunder. <hi>The wayes of God are grievous to wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, much more is God himſelfe;</hi> They ſay what a weariſom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe is it to ſerve the Lord, they ſay his yoake is heavy, and his burden inſupportable, the very outſide of heavenly and ſpirituall worke is burdenſome to them, how then can they maintaine communion with God (in truth of ſpirit) <hi>Who is a Spirit and will be worſhipped in Spirit and in truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note;
<q>Naturall men are blind and fooliſh, they know not wherein their owne happineſſe doth conſiſt, they forſake and throw away the mercies offered them, for lying vanities.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They who are not taught of God are full of miſtaken and falſe principles, among which, this is a principal one; <hi>They ſuppoſe they can doe well enough without God, whereas indeed there is nothing can doe us good without him who is the chiefe good.</hi> Now, that the natural man beleeves he can doe well enough with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God, is plaine from this abominable and hatefull motion which ſuch make to God in the Text, <hi>Depart from us.</hi> No man would deſire God to depart from him, if this perſwaſion did abide upon his heart, <hi>That he could not ſubſiſt without him; or that he depended upon God for his ſubſiſtence.</hi> Therefore this is their opinion (though poſſibly they are as farre from acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, as they are from the true knowledge and love of God) <hi>That they can do well enough alone, that they can ſtand upon their own bottome without God, yea that they are ſelfe-ſufficient, as God is;</hi> for
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:153845:90"/> whoſoever doth not ſee an emptineſſe and inſufficiency in himſelfe, and ſo place his all in God, makes himſelfe a God. This is the way of wicked men, and this their way is <hi>their folly,</hi> (as the Pſalmiſt ſpeakes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.13.) <hi>Though their poſterity approve their ſayings.</hi> Who but they? they can maintaine their being, yea their well-being without God; they can live, and live happily whether he will or no. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if they thought they were beholding to him, eyther for being or well-being, eyther for life, or a happy life, they had never been heard <hi>ſaying to God, depart from us.</hi> And if this be a truth that they have ſayd ſo, and ſay ſo ſtill every day, wee need not ſtay to prove this a truth, that they ſhew their blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and fooliſhnes in ſaying ſo. Is not he fooliſh who would have the Sunne depart from him, which enlightens him? or who would have the Sheild depart from him, which protects him? or who bids the fountaine be gone which gives him drinke; God is all this to all men in ſome degree or other, and he promiſeth himſelfe ſuch in the higheſt and beſt degree to all ſuch as walke uprightly, even to be their Sunne, their Sheild, their fountaine, their ſpring. Then, can folly it ſelfe utter more fooliſhnes then this, <hi>To ſay to God, depart from us?</hi> Further, how fooliſh are they to refuſe that, as if it were a hurt to them, which Saints who have the true wiſdome, have prayed for, and ſtill doe pray for, as the greateſt bleſſing and priviledge, The preſence of God with them. How fooliſh are they who aske and deſire that as a bleſſing, which God the onely wiſe God threatens as the ſoareſt curſe. (<hi>Jer.</hi> 6.8.) <hi>Be inſtructed O Jeruſalem, leſt my ſoule depart from thee, leſt I make thee a Land deſolate, not inhabited:</hi> Utter deſolation is the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, yea the effect of the Lords departure from a Land; and when he ceaſeth in regard of his favourable preſence to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit a Land, eyther none ſhall inhabit it, or none ſhall have a comfortable habitation in it. The Lord threatens this depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as the laſt and ſoareſt, or as the ſumme of all his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and wicked men deſire this, as if to be without God were the chiefe or ſumme of their enjoyments. See another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this folly; among all the threatenings of God againſt ſinfull men, this is one of the greateſt, that he will take away his Goſpel, and the light of his Word from them, yet this a
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:153845:90"/> wicked man deſireth, let the Goſpel goe, let the light of the word goe; He wiſheth it gone, 'tis but a trouble to him, he is ſicke of it, it is a death to him. The beſt of good things is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, and the worſt of evills choſen by thoſe that are evill. As their underſtanding is ſo blinded and diſtempered, <hi>that they call evill good, and good evill, that they put darknes for light, and light for darknes, that they put bitter for ſweete, and ſweete for bitter (Iſa.</hi> 5.20.) So their will and affections are ſo perverted, that they chooſe &amp; embrace darknes for light, evill for good, and that which is moſt bitter, for that which is ſweeter then the honey and the honey-combe.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve. Fourthly.</p>
                  <q>Wicked men are not onely fooliſh, but wild and furious.</q>
                  <p>See at what a rate they ſpeake, even as if they had God at their command, <hi>They ſay to God depart;</hi> As if God could not be where he pleaſed, as if God were at their limiting, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Here's madneſſe, like madneſſe it ſelfe. As there is mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the heart of man in the enjoyment of the creature (<hi>I ſaid of laughter it is mad</hi> (ſayth <hi>Solomon</hi>) Some are ſo over-acted with joy, and laughter, in their creature-enjoyments, that whereas laughter is the proper paſſion of a rational creature, there is nothing more irrational then their laughter, 'Tis plaine down-right madneſſe, Now (I ſay) as ſome carnal men are mad in their manner of enjoying the creature) ſo they are more mad, in refuſing the enjoyments of God the Creator. Who can tell how mad they are who deſire God to depart from them? <hi>They are mad to purpoſe who would put God from them, yet they more who thinke they can.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fiftly; Note.</p>
                  <q>That the godly and the wicked have quite contrary both deſires and fears.</q>
                  <p>What are the deſires and feares of a wicked man, he deſires to have God depart, he is afraid of the preſence of God: what are the deſires of a godly man, he deſires nothing more then the preſence of God, he ſayes as <hi>Moſes (Exod.</hi> 33.15.) <hi>If thy preſence goe not with mee, carry me no further,</hi> I deſire to be no where, but where God manifeſts himſelfe to be; let me ſee the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:153845:91"/> day of my departure out of the world, rather then the day of Gods departure from me in the world; Let riches goe, let li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty goe, let friends and relations goe, ſo God ſtay with me. All company is ſolitarines to me, all fullneſſe is emptineſſe to me, and the moſt populous City worſe then a deſolate wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to me, where I finde not the preſence of God with me. I feare nothing like this, The departure of God from me. I read indeed (<hi>Luke</hi> 5.8.) that <hi>Peter</hi> once ſayd to Chriſt, <hi>Depart from mee, for I am a ſinfull man O Lord.</hi> But the reaſon was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was weary of the preſence of Chriſt, but becauſe he thought himſelfe altogether unworthy of the preſence of Chriſt. And therefore at another time <hi>when many of Chriſts Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples went back &amp; walked no more with him,</hi> and hereupon <hi>Chriſt ſayd to the twelve, Will ye alſo goe away? Then Simon Peter anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, Lord to whom ſhall we goe, thou haſt the words of Eternall Life</hi> (Joh. 6.68.) He who would not go from Chriſt, could not indeed deſire that Chriſt ſhould goe or depart from him. They who have taſted how gratious the Lord is, can never totally depart from God, nor can they at all beare it, that God ſhould depart from them. Thus the Church complaines (<hi>Jer.</hi> 14.9.) <hi>Why ſhouldeſt thou be as a ſtranger in the Land, and as a way fayring man that turneth aſide to tarry for a night. Why ſhouldeſt thou be as a man aſtoniſhed, as a mighty man that cannot ſave, yet thou O Lord, art in the midſt of us, and we are called by thy name, leave us not;</hi> Whatſoever thou doeſt to us, doe not leave us; let any evill come, but doe not thou goe: let ſword come, let famine come, let plague come, but doe not thou depart; <hi>leave us not.</hi> Thus the Saints cling about a departing God, while wicked men are willing he ſhould depart. And co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering the opinion which theſe wicked men had of God, 'tis no wonder though they preſſe him to depart; for what ſhould God do with them, if he can doe nothing for them, or doe them no good: Such was their apprehenſion of God, as appeares in the next clauſe.</p>
                  <q>And what can the Almighty doe for them?</q>
                  <p>They ſhould rather have ſaid; <hi>What cannot the Almighty doe for them?</hi> If the queſtion be put, what the Allmighty can doe? The anſwer is at hand, he that is Allmighty, can do any thing;
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:153845:91"/> yet theſe wretches ſay, <hi>What can the Allmighty doe for them?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Et quid opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur omnipotens eis. <hi>Heb.</hi>
                     </note> Allmightineſſe it ſelfe is queſtioned as weakneſſe, and omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency as impotency by unbeleevers.</p>
                  <p>From the generall ſenſe of this infidel queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That worldly wicked men have low, and ſlight thoughts of God.</q>
                  <p>It is ſayd of a wicked man (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.4.) <hi>God is not in all his thoughts;</hi> that is, he is in none of his thoughts, or God is not at all in his thoughts. But is any man ſo voyd of God, that God is not in all his Thoughts? can any man utterly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh or blot the thoughts of God out of his heart? is not the notion of a God, written with indelible characters upon the heart of man by nature? if not, how is the Law written there by nature? I anſwer, wicked men have thoughts, and cannot but have thoughts of God. But, firſt, <hi>They like not to retaine God in their thoughts,</hi> or (which is the ſame) <hi>in their knowledge (Rom.</hi> 1.28.) Secondly, The thoughts which they have of God, are unworthy of God; while they thinke of God, they thinke below God, and ſo indeed their thoughts are not at all the thoughts of God. While we thinke of God otherwiſe then he is, and hath revealed himſelfe to be, we doe not thinke of the God that made us, but we make an Idol-God in our own thoughts. Now wicked men thinke either that God hath no ſtrength, power, goodneſſe and wiſdome, or can do little with what he hath; <hi>What can the Allmighty doe for them?</hi> They who are afarre off from God by unbeliefe, are not able to diſcerne his power, his goodnes, his wiſdome, his faithfullneſſe, his Allſufficiency; They neyther underſtand what God affirmes of himſelfe, nor give credit to what he hath promiſed unto us. We ſay of thoſe things, <hi>which appeare more then they are, that they affect more afarre off then neere at hand; but thoſe things which are more then they appeare, affect more when they are nigh, then when they are afarre off.</hi> God is infinitely more, then he appeares; And he being neere to thoſe who beleeve, affects them wonderfully. But God is farre from unbeleevers, and they are farre off or in a ſtate of fartheſt diſtance from God, therefore they are not affected with him; But ſay, who is God? what is Gods power?
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:153845:92"/> what is his allmightineſſe? Wee have heard much of him, but wee ſee little in him. They looke upon God, as if he were like the Idolls (deſcribed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.4, 5, 6, 7.) <hi>Who have eyes, and ſee not, eares, and beare not, hands and handle not</hi> &amp;c. All the attributes of God, that he is allmighty, unchangeable, &amp;c. are but a ſound of words or empty titles in their eares. A beleever can make a living out of any attribute of God; for when the Scripture ſaith he lives by faith, the meaning is, he lives upon the goodnes, mercy and power of God, revealed in the promiſe, and layd hold on by faith. Thus the juſt live by faith upon God, but the wicked and unbeleevers cannot live upon thoſe termes; They ſee little or nothing in God to make a Living of, and therefore they ſay; <hi>What can the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty doe for them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>That carnall men count the ſervice of God unprofitable.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What can God do for them? if they ſerve him what profit is it? His is a leane ſervice, they ſhall but ſtarve themſelves by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending upon him, and undoe themſelves by doing his worke. Thus they ſayd in the former Chapter, and ſo they ſay againe in this. The carnal man accounts nothing good but that which is outwardly good: <hi>Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> (Pſal. 4.6.) they know not that all good cometh through the hand of God, that it cometh in at the doore of the promiſe; They can looke no further then they ſee, and therfore becuſe they ſee no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, they looke for none; They doe not ſee that God doth any thing for them, and therefore they conclude he cannot: <hi>What can the Allmighty doe for them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note;
<q>
                        <hi>That,</hi> The ſpirits of worldly men, are meerely mercenary.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If they doe any thing for God, or at the command of God, they doe it only upon hopes of reward, they never obey com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements for the holines that is in them, but for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that comes by them. <hi>What can the Allmighty doe for them?</hi> As when <hi>Judas</hi> betrayed Jeſus Chriſt, he went out with a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinary ſpirit to doe that wickedneſſe; <hi>What will you give mee, and I will betray him?</hi> So when a carnal man ſerves Jeſus Chriſt, he ſayth, What will he give me? what can he doe for me? he
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:153845:92"/> cannot <hi>ſerve God for nought,</hi> that is, freely, as Satan charged <hi>Job</hi> in the beginning of this booke; <hi>Job</hi> ſerveth thee, ſayd Satan, becauſe thou haſt done ſo much for him, becauſe thou haſt ſerved his turne, and made a hedge about him; this was Satans ſlaunder upon that good man; but 'tis no ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>under to ſay ſo of carnal men, <hi>Doe they ſerve God for nought?</hi> They doe not, they cannot; if they may gaine by godlineſſe, they will doe ſomewhat, which ſhall have a ſhew of godlineſſe; profit will make any thing paſſe with and pleaſing to a carnall minde, though in it ſelfe it be never ſo diſpleaſing. Such is the noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the people of God, that though there be a reward in ſerving of him, yet they are ready to ſerve him without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, they can ſerve him upon a bare command, abſtract from promiſes and profits; They can obey God as a creator, though he ſhould not be a rewarder. Godlineſſe is profitable for all things, and hath the promiſe both of this life, and of that which is to come, yet a gratious heart loves Godlineſſe more then profitablenes, and eyes the worke of God more then his reward.</p>
                  <p>Further for the opening of theſe words; Some read thus, <hi>What can the allmighty doe againſt them?</hi> The Hebrew particle ſtands indifferently to both, and may be tranſlated <hi>for,</hi> or <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt,</hi> in which ſenſe we finde it in the 35<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of this Booke,<note place="margin">Si peccaveris quid ei noce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis, <hi>propriè,</hi> quid ei facies.</note> 
                     <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7. <hi>If thou ſinneſt what doſt thou againſt him?</hi> That is, what hurt doſt thou to God? thy ſinne cannot reach, or wound him, what doſt thou againſt him? Thus here; <hi>They ſay to the allmigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty depart from us, and what can the allmighty doe againſt them?</hi> Surely the allmighty is not able to hurt us; from him we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no good, and from him we feare no evill. Were not theſe mighty men, thinke you, who thought the Allmighty could not match them? Theſe were mighty men indeed, Giants ſons of <hi>Anak</hi> no doubt they were, but Giants in wickednes. And ſo this reading gives us a further character or diſcovery of a wicked mans Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>Some wicked men have this preſumption, that let God doe his worſt, he cannot hurt them.</q>
                  <p>I finde in Scripture a threefold falſe and preſumptuous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:153845:93"/> which evill men have of God while they are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evill.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some preſume that God will protect them from evill while they doe evill. (<hi>Mich.</hi> 3.11.) <hi>The beads there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of judge for reward, and the Prieſts thereof teach for hire, and the Prophets thereof divine for money, yet will they leane upon the Lord and ſay, Is not the Lord among us? none evill can come upon us.</hi> Theſe were ſuch as made it their buſines to breake the Law of God, yet they thought God would not ſuffer any trouble to breake in upon them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others preſume that, at leaſt, God will not be ſo ſevere as to inflict thoſe evills which he hath threatned. The old world was threatned with a Deluge, but they could not beleeve God would make good his word, they even mockt at the credulity and ſimplicity of <hi>Noah,</hi> to ſee him build that great Ship or Arke upon the dry Land, as if he meant to ſayle his veſſel without water. As for them, they neither bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ved nor feared a flood. So they (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.19.) will put the Lord to a triall, <hi>Let him haſten his worke that we may ſee it;</hi> let us ſee what he will doe; as if they had ſaid to the Prophet, you told us what he would doe, how ſevere he would be, what mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all your talke, we would ſee ſomething done. What will the Allmighty doe againſt us? Surely nothing; he is not ſo ſtrict as you make him. The Prophet deſcribes the worſt of men, the <hi>men ſetled on their lees,</hi> ſpeaking thus (<hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.12.) <hi>They ſay in their heart, the Lord will not doe good, neither will he doe evill;</hi> that is, he will neyther reward nor puniſh, he will ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther helpe nor hurt. To ſay eyther of theſe is alike diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable unto God; To ſay eyther much more both (though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to ſay eyther is to ſay both) is to ſay, not only that God is neyther to be loved nor feared, but that he is not at all. It is the glory of God to doe the one as well as to doe the other, and unleſſe he could doe both, he could doe neyther. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.7.) <hi>I forme the light, and create darkneſſe,</hi> (the darkneſſe of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is of God as much as the light of comfort) <hi>I make peace and create evill;</hi> the evill of puniſhment is as much the creature of God as peace is, and God doth as much appeare a creator in the one as in the other; the doing of this kinde of evill doth as much ſhew the power, and providence of God, as the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:153845:93"/> of good; yet thoſe in the Prophet ſayd the Lord will doe neither; <hi>He will neither doe good, neyther will be doe evill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Thoſe in the Text were rayſed to a higher pitch of preſumption then both the former; For they ſayd, what can the Allmighty doe againſt us? As if they had ſayd, Let him doe his worſt, wee feare him not; To thinke that God will ſheild us from the evill which others threaten, or that he will not bring that evill upon us which himſelfe hath threatned, when we doe evill, are very high actings of preſumption; But to thinke that God can doe nothing againſt us, to thinke that the Arme of God is ſhorter then that it can reach us, or weaker then that it can over-power us; to thinke that we have out-growne divine juſtice, and are too big or too ſtrong to be dealt with by the Allmighty is preſumption to madnes; woe to thoſe ſinners who ſecure themſelves in the goodnes of God to them, more woe to thoſe who ſecure themſelves in Gods neglect of them, but above all, woe is their portion who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themſelves as it were in the weaknes of God, even while in words they acknowledge his power; ſaying, What can the Allmighty doe againſt us?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Others read the words thus; <hi>They ſay to the all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty depart from us, and what hath the allmighty done againſt them?</hi> That is, what hurt hath God done them? They are troubled at the preſence of God; But what cauſe hath God given them to be troubled at his preſence? And then we may connect theſe words with the words of the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe; <hi>What hath God done againſt them? yea he filled their houſes with good things;</hi> that's all the dammage he did them? This is a fayre ſence, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the Original Text: leaving the reader to his choyce; I ſhall only give the obſervation which riſeth clearely from this.</p>
                  <q>God never giveth wicked men any juſt cauſe to be weary of him.</q>
                  <p>He never doth them any wrong, and he often gives them many a bleſſing; and have they any reaſon to bid him depart? he is uſually very patient towards them, and doth never bring any evill upon them till they have doubly deſerved it; and have they any reaſon to be diſpleaſed at that? yea whenſoever he puniſheth them in this world, he puniſheth them then
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:153845:94"/> their ſinnes deſerve; indeed there is a puniſhment behinde adaequate and commenſurate to their ſinne, but they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be puniſhed beyond what or more then their ſin deſerves. Seeing then their puniſhment in the next life, though it will be great beyond imagining, yet ſhall not be great beyond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving; and all their puniſhments in this life are leſſe then the demerit of their ſinne) As was paenitentially confeſſed by <hi>Ezra</hi> in the name of the <hi>Jewes</hi> after they had been broken by the ſword, and brought into captivity for their ſinne, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.13 Seeing (I ſay) 'tis but thus with them when 'tis worſt with them) What hath the Allmighty done againſt them? is not all their deſtruction (meritoriouſly) from themſelves?</p>
                  <p>Againe, How much ſoever God puniſheth them in this life, they have no reaſon to complaine, or <hi>ſay to God depart from us;</hi> for even thoſe puniſhments are meſſages from God to awaken them out of their ſinnes, and ſo to prevent worſer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; therefore when God perceived that ſtubborne people going on in their ſinnes, telleth them he will ſmite there no more, as implying that it was his favour to ſmite them. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.5.) <hi>Why ſhould ye be ſmitten any more, ye will revolt more and more.</hi> Surely then ſuch have no reaſon to <hi>ſay to God, depart from us,</hi> when he ſmites them, as if he did them ey ther hurt or wrong, ſeing he ſmites them, that they might returne unto him; Thoſe judgements of God are a mercy, which are ſent to teach man his duty. Now if the judgements of God have ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time mercy in them, and never have any injury in them, what hurt or injury can there be to man in the ſervice of God? Hath the Allmighty done any thing againſt them, whom he lovingly invites to the doing of his will? And yet ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of wrong when they are onely called to doe what is right, and cry out as if God hurt them, when he doth but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne them. The Lord calls his murmuring people to account about this thing, (<hi>Mich.</hi> 6.3.) <hi>O my people, what have I done to thee</hi> (that is, what hurt, what wrong have I done unto thee) <hi>and wherein have I wearied thee, teſtifie againſt mee;</hi> As if he had ſayd? thou haſt nothing to bring againſt me in evidence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be my kindnes, as it follows (<hi>ver.</hi> 4.) <hi>For I brought thee up out of the Lord of Egypt, and redeemed thee our of the houſe of ſervants, and I ſent before thee, Moſes, Aaran, and Miriam. O my
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:153845:94"/> people, remember</hi> &amp;c. Conſider all my dealings with thee, all the deliverances I have wrought for thee, all the Statutes and Ordinances, all the Lawes and Commandements which I have given thee, and then let thy Conſcience ſpeake; What have I done unto thee, which is an evill to thee? or wherein have I wearied thee, in the things which I have required thee to doe? I have done many good workes for thee, and I have comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thee to doe many workes, ſuch workes as are not onely good in themſelves, but good for them who doe them; for which of theſe is it that thou art weary of me? <hi>There is not that wicked man in the world but God may ſay to him, what have I done to thee, or what have I called thee to doe, that thou ſhouldeſt be weary of mee?</hi> that thou ſhouldeſt deſire me to depart from thee? Thus if we reade the words in this latter ſence; <hi>What hath the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty done againſt them?</hi> They carry a reproofe of their ingr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude againſt God, who had not hurt them, yea who had done them good. If we reade the words in the ſecond ſence; <hi>What can the Allmighty doe againſt them?</hi> They carry a high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and ſlight of his power, as if God could doe them no hurt. If we reade the words in the firſt ſence according to our tranſlation (which I rather pitch upon) they carry (upon contrary termes) a like contempt of the power of God, as if he could doe them no Good; <hi>What can the Allmighty doe for them?</hi>

                  <p>Chriſt perſwaded his hearers (and us in them) upon this account to love their enemies, <hi>That they and we might be the children of our father which is in heaven; For he maketh his Sunne to riſe on the evill and on the Good, and ſendeth raine on the juſt, and on the unjuſt</hi> (Matth. 5.45.) As God hath ſome peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo he hath ſome peculiar bleſſings, and good things, which the world in common ſhares not in; but he hath a ſort of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and good things, which are the common ſhare of the world; raine and Sun, fat and ſweet, Gold and ſilver are ſuch good things as their hearts and houſes are often filled with, whoſe hearts and houſe are empty of goodnes. Theſe good things God gives them, who know no more why he gives them, then they did, why he did not ſuddenly bring evill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, of whom the Apoſtle ſpeakes (<hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4.) <hi>Deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſſe, and forbearance, and long-ſuffering, not knowing that the goodneſſe of God leadeth thee to repentance;</hi> when God doth good to thoſe that are evill, whether it be by beſtowing good upon them, or by withholding evill, He doth it uſually for one of or both theſe reaſons.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, The Lord doth them good who continue in the evill of ſinne, that they might be left inexcuſeable when the evill of wrath and puniſhment falls upon them; every mouth ſhall be ſtopped, &amp; all the world of wicked ones become guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie before God, when they remember that they ſinned, and went on to ſinne againſt the God that ſed them, againſt the God that cloathed them, againſt the God <hi>that filled their houſes with good things,</hi> and protected them in the uſe and enjoyment

This was the ſin of <hi>Jeſurun, that when he waxed fat he kicked,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayth (<hi>Deut.</hi> 32.15.) <hi>Thou art waxen fat, thou art growne thicke, thou art covered with fatnes; Then he forſooke God which made him, and lightly eſteemed the rocke of his Salvation.</hi> Their fin is great who lightly eſteeme God while he makes them leane, but how ſinfull is their ſin, who ſlight God that hath made them fat. As good things received binde us ſtronger unto duty, ſo good things abuſed, binde us ſtronger under guilt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, As wee connect theſe words with the latter branch of the former verſe; <hi>What can the allmighty doe for them? yet he filled their houſes with good things.</hi> Wee may take this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
                  <q>Though Carnal men receive many good things from God, yet then know him not as the fountaine of them.</q>
                  <p>They who are evill cannot own God purely eyther in good
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:153845:96"/> or evill. It is but ſeldom that they ſay, with that wicked King, <hi>This evill is of the Lord</hi> (2 Kings 6.33.) And it is ſeldomer that they ſay, this good is of the Lord They ſay, what good doth God for us? eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whil he filleth their houſes with good things. Indeed the beſt of Saints receive many good things from God which they know not of; they receive many ſecret mercies, ſecret I meane not only to others, but to themſelves; and ſo they are not able to give God the glory of them diſtinctly, becauſe they have not a diſtinct knowledge of them. But all the good things which the wicked have are to them of an unknowne original. Though they know what they have, yet they know not from whence or from whom they have what they have; they know not who feeds them, who cloaths them, who provids for them: yea though they make many formal acknowledgements of this, and will tell you of Gods goodnes to them, yet really they know it not, nor doe they cordially acknowledge it. The Lord complaines of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple about this (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.3.) <hi>The Ox knoweth his owner, and the Aſſe his Maſters cribb,</hi> (he upbraids them not onely as below other men, but a below the beaſts, as if the reaſonleſſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures had acted more rationally then they) <hi>but Iſraell doth not know, my people doe not conſider:</hi> What was it they did not know, nor conſider? they knew not nor conſidered what the Ox and the Aſſe knew and conſider<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus alſo <hi>the aſſe knoweth his Maſters crib,</hi> as he knoweth that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter imployeth him, ſo he knoweth that his Maſter provideth for him. The dull Aſſe takes notice of the cribb, and knowes where and by whom he receiveth Good; but yee my people know not me, ye doe not conſider him that ſeeds you; For I <hi>have nouriſhed and brought up children, and they have rebelled againſt mee,</hi> they never honoured me as the fountaine and founder of their felicity. The Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> reproves the ſame ſottiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and blindnes in that people (<hi>Chap.</hi> 2.8, 9.) <hi>For ſhe did not know that I gave her come, and wine, and oyle, and multiplyed her ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and gold, which they prepared for Baal.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:153845:96"/> that I am he who gave them. Carnal men attribute their good things, and the filling of their houſes with them to any thing rather then to God. They thanke their friends or their good fortune; they thanke themſelves, their policy, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, for what they have. They aſcend not up to God in thankfulnes for what they have. They who ſay, <hi>What can the Allmighty doe for them?</hi> How ſhould they acknowledge, that the Allmighty hath done any thing for them? The Prophet (<hi>Hab:</hi> 1.16.) ſpeaks of men <hi>thoſe portion was fatt, and their meate plenteous;</hi> but to whom did they referre all this? whom did they acknowledge for their benefactor, or as the cauſe of thoſe great ſucceſſes? The Prophet tells us, <hi>They ſacrificed to their nets, and burnt incenſe to their drags.</hi> The words carry an alluſion to fiſhing, in which worke or art netts and drags are the inſtruments of the fiſherman; ſo that to ſacrifice to the net or to the dragge, is to give the honour and thanks of all our attainements to ſecond cauſes, and creature helps, to our own wit, power, and induſtry, &amp;c. To theſe ſayth the Prophet <hi>they ſacrificed;</hi> That is, they honoured them in the place or ſtead of God; <hi>Sacrifice it proper and peculiar to God,</hi> and therefore he that offers ſacrifice to any thing, makes it his God, or puts it in the place of God; They who thanke themſelves for the good they have, are a God to themſelves. And thus wee finde The <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> aſcribing all to his owne power (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.14) <hi>By the ſtrength of my hand I have done it, and by my wiſdome, for I am prudent, and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treaſures, and I have put downe the inhabitants like a valiant man;</hi> he did not thinke that the Lord did it by his hand, <hi>but</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by the ſtrength of my hand I have done it:</hi>

                  <p>Fifthly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>That the portion of wicked men lyeth all on this ſide heaven, and heavenly things.</q>
                  <p>God filleth their houſes with good things, but they are the good things of this life; they have nothing that reacheth to eternal life. They have nothing that concernes pardon of ſin, or grace, much leſſe have they glory for their portion. (<hi>Acts</hi> 14.16, 17.) <hi>God did not leave himſelfe without witneſſe</hi> (among the Heathen Nations) <hi>in that he did good, and gave raine from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and fruitfull ſeaſons, filling their hearts with food; and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> ſo much they received from God, as filled them with food for their bodyes, and made their lives comfortable; but no more, that was all they had. As <hi>Abraham</hi> in the parable tells the rich man in hel (<hi>Luk.</hi> 16.25.) <hi>Son remember that thou in thy life time haſt had thy good things.</hi> And what were the good things which he formerly had? We have an anſwer at the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>He was cloathed in purple and fine linnen, and fared deliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every day.</hi> As the Pſalmiſt is expreſſe (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.14.) that <hi>the men of this world have their portion in this life,</hi> ſo, his purpoſe is to ſhew, that they have their portion in the things of this life; for he adds, <hi>Whoſe bellyes thou fillest with thy hid treaſures,</hi> that is, with thoſe treaſures of corne, wine, and oyle, which are virtually hidden in the earth, and brought forth by the earth; God fills the bellyes of the wicked, but he fills the Spirits of the Godly; he fills the former with the hidden treaſures of the earth, he fills none but the latter with the hidden treaſures of heaven.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Note.</p>
                  <q>That the gifts of God even in temporall things are free and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</q>
                  <p>Not onely are ſpirituall gifts and graces, together with eternall life undeſerved, but even temporalls, and the things of this life. The Lord gives them unto his enemies, to thoſe that ſay to him, <hi>depart from us;</hi> and what doe theſe deſerve at his hands, but ſtripes and death?

                  </p>
                  <q>But the counſell of the wicked is farre from mee.</q>
                  <p>Wee had theſe words before (<hi>Chap</hi> 21.16.) <hi>Job</hi> made uſe of them there, and here <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> therefore I ſhall adde but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for explication in this place. In generall know, they are a <hi>proverbiall ſpeech,</hi>

So when a man ſayth, ſuch or ſuch a thing <hi>is farre from me,</hi> his meaning is he utterly deteſts it, or that the thing is the very abomination of his ſoule. Therefore while <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſayth; <hi>The counſell of the wicked is farre from me,</hi> it is, as if he had ſayd, <hi>I cannot indure to have any thing to doe eyther with the wicked, or with their counſel.

                  <p>But what is the counſell of the wicked? their counſell may be taken; firſt, for that diſhonorable opinion which they held of God, that he could doe nothing eyther for them or againſt them. I (ſaith <hi>Eliphaz</hi>) am of another minde, of another faith and perſwaſion. Their Counſel is farre from me who
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:153845:98"/> eyther deny the providence of God, or thinke they can hide themſelves from the eye of his providence; I beleeve that his eye beholdeth all, and that his hand worketh whatſoever pleaſeth him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others by <hi>Counſell</hi> underſtand the ſcope of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men; ſo <hi>Calvin</hi> reades, <hi>the intent of the wicked is farre from me;</hi> I have other purpoſes and deſignes then they have; <hi>The ploughing of the wicked</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Pro. 21.4.) <hi>is ſin;</hi> that is, the ſtirring and plotting of his minde to get his deſires ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied is ſinfull; I deſire not (ſaith <hi>Eliphaz</hi>) to put my hand to their plough. <hi>The counſell of the wicked is farre from me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As the deſigne and plot, ſo the courſe and way of the wicked <hi>is farre from me.</hi> The counſel of a man is put for the meanes by which he acteth his deſignes, as wel as for the method in which he layeth them. Wee ſhall not wrong the drift of the Text in which ſoever of theſe three ſences we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this proteſtation, <hi>The counſel of the wicked is farre from mee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, There is a threefold difference about the reading and relation of theſe words, which put together will give us yet a further light and underſtanding about them.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Quae conſilia illi ineunt longe ſunt a deo.</note>Firſt, The Septuagint reade thus; <hi>The counſel of the wicked is farre from him;</hi> and the antecedent, <hi>to him</hi> (according to their ſence) is God himſelfe.

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others apprehend, that <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpake thus in the perſon of <hi>Job,</hi> and onely reaſſumed what he had ſaid (<hi>Chap</hi> 21.16.) <hi>O this is the man that ſayd even now the counſell of the wicked is farre from mee; Pray conſider, This is the man that profeſſed he would not ſo much as come neere a wicked man, he would have nothing to doe with their counſells,</hi>

                     </note> or from the teeth outward, that <hi>the counſell of the wicked was farre from you,</hi> but I have proved that you approach too neere them both in courſe and councel. I ſay, what you ſayd, but I ſay it (which you did not) in ſincerity, I profeſſe, and what I profeſſe is true, that <hi>the counſell of the wicked is farre from me. The ſame truth may be profeſſed by different perſons, upon different grounds and to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ends:</hi> the ſame premiſes doe not alwayes yeeld the ſame concluſions in the minds of mens, though in themſelves they doe. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> thought his counſel as farre from <hi>Jobs,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> had profeſſed himſelfe to be from the councel of the wicked. When <hi>Job</hi> ſayd, <hi>The counſel of the wicked is farre from me;</hi> his purpoſe was to ſhew that though he was afflicted like wicked men, yea, that though he was afflicted while many wicked men were proſpered, that yet he was not at all ſpirited or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pl'd like wicked men. And that therefore his friends aſſertion muſt needs be falſe, who numbred him with the wicked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was afflicted. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſeemes to retort this upon <hi>Job,</hi> and to ſay, if this be ſo, as thou affirmeſt, ſurely then God hath layd aſide the care of this world, and lets all things run at ſix and ſevens; for ſurely if he tooke notice of men, eyther what they were, or what they were doing, he would never ſuffer the wicked to proſper, no nor to eſcape unpuniſhed. And ſeing thou continueſt ſo ſtiffe in thy opinion, that thou doeſt not ſuffer theſe grievous calamities for thy ſinne, thou ſeemeſt to me plainly to comply with their blaſphemy, who querie, <hi>how doth God know? can be judge through the darke cloud?</hi> This counſel of the wicked is farre from me. And ſeeing as <hi>Job</hi> before, ſo <hi>Eliphaz</hi> here aſcribes counſel (which is the moſt deliberate act) to the wicked. We may obſerve.</p>

'Tis the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a wicked man, that his ſinne is his counſel, and that his art is in it as much as his nature; <hi>The counſell of the wicked is farre from me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> doth not ſay how farre the counſel of the wicked was from him, but that it was farre from him, and <hi>by farre,</hi> he meanes <hi>furtheſt;</hi> as if he had ſayd, it is as farre from me as farre may be, I have no complyance with their counſels.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>That the ſpirit and way of the godly, and the wicked are as diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent as their end and concluſion ſhall be.</q>
                  <p>They are at furtheſt diſtance; They are like two paralel lines, which how farre ſoever they run together, they never meete together, nor touch in a poynt. The concluſion of a wicked man or his end is farre from that of the upright; the end of the one is light, the end of the other is darkneſſe; the one ends in ſorrow, the other in joy, the end of the one is peace, of the other trouble. And ſo the way of the one is ſin, the way of the other is holines; the way of the one is oppeſſion and covetouſneſſe, the way of the other is juſtice and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; the way of the one is faith, the way of the other is unbeliefe. Now as darknes and light, joy and ſorrow, peace and trouble, can never comply or be united; ſo neyther can ſin and holines, oppreſſion and juſtice, faith and unbeliefe. There's no communion between theſe contraries, between theſe wayes and ends, counſel and concluſions. And unleſſe wee keepe farre from the counſels of the wicked, wee cannot

And hence it is that the Spirit of God by <hi>Solomon</hi> gives ſuch a vehement admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to beware of the way of wicked men (<hi>Pro.</hi> 4.14, 15.) <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not into the path of the wicked, and goe not in the way of evill men; avoyd it, paſſe not by it, turne from it and paſſe away.</hi> As in the former context, <hi>he, as a carefull father,</hi> had preſſed his Sonne to the cloſeſt purſuit of wiſdomes way, ſo here, he as earneſtly preſſeth him, to depart from the path of wickednes; He would have his ſonne not only not goe into it, but not ſo much <hi>as paſſe by it,</hi> that is, not goe neere it; as the next words intimate, <hi>turne from it,</hi> as if he had ſayd, keepe at a diſtance, keepe alooſe off; doe not ſtay ſo long within ſight of it as to looke upon it, that's his laſt counſel, <hi>paſſe away,</hi> not to returne or come neere it any more. And while we conſider whither that way leads, we ſhall eaſily grant that when all is ſayd, little enough is ſayd to lead us away from it. Where the way is ſinne, the wages is death. Therefore let him who deſires to avoyd the concluſion of the wicked, ſay, <hi>The counſell of the wicked is farre from me.</hi>

The former verſe tells us; <hi>They ſpeake not peace, but they deviſe deceitfull matters againſt them that are quiet in the Land.</hi> When theſe deviſes tooke, and had ſucceſſe, then they were pleaſed, then they had what they would, and ſaw what they deſired.

                  <p>Againe we may expound this act of ſeing with reference to the object ſeene; and ſo it imports 2 things; firſt, the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of their fall: wicked men ſhall undoubtedly be deſtroyed, and there ſhall be eye-witneſſes, honeſt and faithfull witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, teſtifying their deſtruction; <hi>The righteous ſhall ſee it,</hi> and report it to after generations.</p>

                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>The judgements of God upon the wicked are matter of joy to the righteous.</q>
                  <p>It is the duty of the Saints <hi>to mourne with them that mourne, and to rejoyce with them that rejoyce</hi> (Rom. 12.15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) But then we muſt underſtand theſe mourners and rejoycers to be ſuch as themſelves are. Saints muſt mourne with mourning Saints, and rejoyce with rejoycing Saint. The godly are not bound
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:153845:102"/> eyther to joy the joyes, or ſorrow the ſorrowes of the wicked. The judgements of God upon the wicked have a twofold ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect eminently noted in Scripture. Firſt, they cauſe feare; and ſecondly, they cauſe joy. When exemplary juſtice was to be done (according to the law of <hi>Moſes)</hi> upon preſumptuous tranſgreſſours, it is ſayd, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 13.11.) <hi>All Iſrael ſhall heare, and feare, and ſhall doe no more any ſuch wickednes. David</hi> (Pſal. 64.) having complained to God in prayer of the cruelty of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and begged protection from their malicious practiſes, growes up to much aſſurance, that downe they muſt (<hi>v.</hi> 7, 8.) <hi>But God ſhall ſhoot at them with an arrow, ſuddenly ſhall they be wounded;</hi> and then (<hi>ver.</hi> 9.) <hi>All men ſhall feare, and ſhall declare the worke of God, for they ſhall wiſely conſider of his doings.</hi> Thus feare is the iſſue of divine judgement; And yet joy is the iſſue of them at the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of the ſame Pſalme; <hi>The righteous ſhall be glad in the Lord, and truſt in him, and all the upright in heart ſhall glory.</hi> Feare is a common effect; <hi>All men ſhall feare;</hi> Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, faith and glorying, (which is faith triumphant) are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the upright, when the arrow of God wounds the wicked. Wee have this double effect againe expreſt upon the ſame occaſion (Pſal. 107.42.) <hi>He powreth contempt upon Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and cauſeth them to wander in the wilderneſſe where there is no way; but he ſets the poore oh high; the righteous ſhall it and rejoyce.</hi> What ſhall they ſee? not only the Godly poore ſet on high, but ungodly Princes filled with contempt, that's part of the ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle which the righteous ſhall behold and beholding rejoyce; yet this is not all, for it follows; <hi>And all iniquity ſhall ſtop her mouth;</hi> The abſtract is put for the concrete, iniquity for men of iniquity: And ſo the meaning is men of iniquity, or wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men ſhall ſtop their mouths; their mouths ſhall be ſtopt With ſhame and feare, they ſhall have nothing to ſay when the Lord doth this; They ſhall not mutter a word againſt the workes of God; but as <hi>Hannah</hi> ſpeakes in her Song (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.9.) <hi>ſhall be ſilent in darknes.</hi> A like report rayſeth the hearts of the people of God into a holy merriment (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.8.) <hi>Sion heard, and was glad, the daughters of Judah rejoyced.</hi> What was the matter? what good newes came to <hi>Judah?</hi> what to <hi>Sion?</hi> the Text reſolves us; <hi>Becauſe of thy judgements O Lord:</hi> The anſwer is not, <hi>becauſe of thy mercies,</hi> or becauſe of thy goodnes O Lord,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:153845:103"/> but becauſe of thy judgements, and thoſe were dreadfull ones (<hi>ver.</hi> 3.) <hi>A fire goeth before him and burneth up his enemies round about. Confounded be all they that ſerve graven Images,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 7. <hi>Sion heard of it, and was glad.</hi> Once more (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.10.) <hi>The righteous ſhall rejoyce when he ſeeth the vengeance, he ſhall waſh his feete in the bloud of the ungodly.</hi> Not that the righteous delight in bloud, or proudly inſult over the worſt of enemies; The Pſalmiſt doth only in hyperbolical ſtraines of Eloquence, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the language of triumphant conquerers, expreſſe a compleate and glorious victory. The ſtile is of the ſame ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification with that (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.23.) <hi>That thy foote may be dipped in the bloud of thine enemies, and the tongue of the doggs in the ſame.</hi> When ſo much bloud is ſhed that the foote may be dipt and waſhed in it, that doggs may lap it up like water, this argues a great deſtruction, and when the wicked are thus deſtroyed, the righteous ſhall rejoyce.</p>
                  <p>But here it may be queried, What matter of joy is this? why ſhould the righteous rejoyce in the ſorrowes of the wicked? is it not alike ſinful to be troubled at the joyes, and to rejoyce at the troubles of our brethren? The light of nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns rejoycing over thoſe who are in miſery; and we have an expreſſe Scripture againſt it (<hi>Pro.</hi> 24.17.) <hi>Rejoyce not when thine enemy falleth, let not thy heart be glad when he ſtumbleth.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> puts it among the ſins of his enemies (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.15.) <hi>In my adverſity they rejoyced.</hi> And he profeſſed (<hi>ver.</hi> 13.) <hi>that when they were ſicke his cloathing was ſacke cloath, and that he humbled his ſoule with faſting. David</hi> was ſo farre from rejoycing when his enemies were ruined, or dead, that he mourned when they were but ſicke, and would not eate, when they could not. And as <hi>Davids</hi> holy practice denyed it, ſo doth <hi>Solomons</hi> divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; <hi>Rejoyce not when thine enemy falleth.</hi> How then ſhall wee reconcile theſe Texts?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, there may be a rejoycing at the afflictions and troubles of others, which is not onely unbecoming and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemely for the righteous; but very ſinfull. As</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To rejoyce, and be glad, meerely becauſe an enemy is fallen into miſery, is both unſeemly and ſinfull. And ſo we are to underſtand <hi>Solomons</hi> Proverbe; <hi>Rejoyce not when thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my falleth.</hi> Some underſtand this of falling into ſinne. Hee
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:153845:103"/> makes himſelfe a ſinner indeed, who rejoyceth becauſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath ſinned. He that rejoyceth becauſe another hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, rejoyceth (upon the matter) becauſe God is diſhonoured. Such joy is a kinde of thankſgiving for Satans victory. But as to rejoyce becauſe another falls into ſin, is the worſt fall into ſinne; ſo to rejoyce meerely becauſe an enemy falls into miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is worſe then our owne falling into miſery. He ſhewes that he hath not the heart of a man in him, who is glad at the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of any man, And he who rejoyceth thus when his enemy falleth, doth himſelfe fall much worſe. The ruine and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of an enemy (ſuppoſe him the vileſt enemy) conſidered in it ſelfe, is meate and drinke to none but revengefull and envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpirits. <hi>David</hi> was much troubled and chargeth it as an extreame peece of folly upon himſelfe, <hi>Becauſe he was envious at the fooliſh when he ſaw the proſperity of the wicked</hi> (Pſal. 73.3.) Now it is an iſſue flowing from the ſame principle, purely to envy the proſperity and purely to rejoyce in the adverſity of the wicked. <hi>Nero</hi> was juſtly reckoned a monſter among men, who could ſing when himſelfe had ſet <hi>Rome</hi> a fire: And they have ſome-what of a Neronian ſpirit in them, who can ſing when they ſee their enemies conſuming in the fire. God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights not in the miſery of man (as it is miſery upon man) nor doe they, who are taught of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As to rejoyce or be glad at the deſtruction of enemies, meerely becauſe they are deſtroyed; ſo to rejoyce up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on private ends or reſpects, becauſe they being taken out of the way and removed out of the world we hope to have more ſcope and roome in the world for our ſelves; or becauſe we hope to ſtep into their places, to fit downe in their ſeates, to poſſeſſe our ſelves of their lands and riches, to fill our ſelves with their ſpoyles; upon this account to rejoyce when wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men fall, when the Lord powres out contempt upon Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, (becauſe (I ſay) we hope to be gainers by it) is alltoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uncomely for the righteous. Let the righteous take heed to themſelves, that they be not found thus rejoycing in the calamities of the wicked. They who doe ſo are eyther but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to godlineſs, men who are onely of the faction of the righteous (for though they who are righteous indeed are farre from a faction, yes there are a ſor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of men, who profeſſe righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:153845:104"/> as if it were nothing but a faction, now (I ſay) they who thus rejoyce are but eyther of the faction of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) while they are really of the number of the wicked, or if they are really righteous who doe ſo, (and I confeſſe that a righteous man may doe ſo, <hi>David</hi> (which was acting the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-part) envied their proſperity, and by the ſame reaſon any godly man may be acted out in joy at their adverſity, but now (I ſay) if they who are really righteous doe ſo) we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them under a ſore temptation, and they will at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude of themſelves as <hi>David</hi> did in the counter-caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.22.) <hi>ſo fooliſh have we been and ignorant, even as a beaſt before thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You will ſay then, how may or doe the righteous rejoyce when the ungodly fall, and not fall into ſin themſelves.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt, The righteous rejoyce at the fall of the wicked, as bleſſing God who hath kept their feete from thoſe wayes in which the wicked have fallen; As 'tis a great mercy to be kept out of thoſe ill wayes, to be kept from fiding with thoſe corrupt intereſts, in the purſuit of which we ſee many broken; ſo 'tis a duty to rejoyce that we have not walked in their way whoſe end we ſee to be nothing els but deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The righteous have cauſe to rejoyce &amp; bleſſe God when they ſee the wicked fall, becauſe themſelves are ſaved, &amp; keepe their ſtanding; becauſe themſelves have eſcaped the danger, and the Lord hath been a banner of protection over them in the day when the wicked fell. <hi>Moſes</hi> after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Amaleck built an Altar, and called the name of it Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hova-Niſſi (Exod.</hi> 17.15.) that is to ſay, <hi>The Lord is my ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> And in like caſes the joy of the Saints is not properly in the deſtruction of the wicked, but in their owne deliverance, through the mighty power &amp; good hand of God with them. It is the preſence of God with them, the appearance of God for them, which is the gladnes of their hearts.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The righteous then rejoyce, becauſe the Church and people of God are in a fayre way to peace; when the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are deſtroyed, the ſheepe are in ſafety; when the Wolves and the Beares are cut off, the flock reſts quietly; ſo in this caſe when men of devouring cruell ſpirits, wicked and ungodly ones, are removed, the flocke of God, the ſheepe of his paſture
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:153845:104"/> feed quietly, none making them afrayd. The fall of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Sion,</hi> is the eſtabliſhment of <hi>Sion;</hi> yea in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of mankinde. As the Prophet moſt elegantly ſets it forth (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.6, 7, 8.) <hi>He who ſmote the people in wrath with a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall ſtroke, he that ruled the Nations in anger, is perſecuted and none hindereth; The whole earth is at reſt, and is quiet: they breake forth into ſinging, yea the firre-trees rejoyce at thee, and the Cedars of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon, ſaying, ſince thou art layd downe no feller is come up againſt us.</hi> How often have wicked men in power felled not onely the Firre-trees and Cedars of the world, but the goodly trees of righteouſneſſe in the Lords plantations; have they not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reaſon to ſing when ſuch fall, ſeing the Fellers themſelves are then felled and fallen.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Joy ariſeth to the righteous, becauſe God is honoured in the fall of wicked men; And that's their chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt joy. That God is honoured is more joy to the righteous, then that themſelves are ſaved, how much more then, then that the wicked are deſtroyed. There is a threefold honour ariſing to God when the wicked fall.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God is honoured in his juſtice; ſuch a day <hi>is the day of the declaration of the righteous judgement of God;</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the great day of Judgement (<hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5.) <hi>Thou after thy hardneſſe and impenitent heart, treaſureſt up to thy ſelfe wrath againſt the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgement of God.</hi> Some doe even queſtion the juſtice of God when wicked men proſper, but he is vindicated in his juſtice when wicked men fall; It cannot but pleaſe righteous men, to ſee the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous God exalted, or God exalted in his righteouſneſſe. They know and beleeve that God is righteous, when the wicked proſper (<hi>Jer.</hi> 12.1.) But when the wicked are puniſhed, they proclaime his righteouſnes, Then <hi>they ſing the ſong of Moſes the ſervant of God, and the ſong of the Lambe, ſaying, Great and marvai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous are thy workes Lord God Almighty, juſt and true are thy wayes thou King of Saints. Who ſhall not feare thee O Lord, and glorifie thy Name,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for thy Judgements are made manifeſt,</hi> (Rev. 15.3, 4.) The Lord is alwayes alike Juſt, but it doth not alwayes alike appeare how juſt he it. And as, that God is juſt is the faith and ſtay of the Saints, ſo the appearances of his juſtice are their joy and triumph.</p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:153845:105"/>
                  <p>Secondly, God is honoured much in the attribute of his truth; in the truth of his word, in the truth of his threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, when the wicked are puniſhed. God hath ſpoken bloudy words concerning wicked men; not onely in reference to their future eſtate in the next life, but to their preſent eſtate in this. <hi>Say to the wicked it ſhall be ill with him, the reward of his hands ſhall be given him.</hi> But what is this reward? There are two ſorts of rewards; Firſt, rewards of love and favour according to the good which we have done; Secondly, rewards of wrath and anger, poenal rewards, according to the evill which we have done. Now when the Lord puts theſe poenal rewards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the wicked, or powres them upon their heads, he is honoured in his truth as well as his juſtice, for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it. As <hi>the promiſes are yea and Amen</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20.) ſo alſo are the threatnings, <hi>unto the glory of God by us.</hi> But as when <hi>David</hi> ſaw his life in danger every day, he began to queſtion the truth of God, in the promiſe, that he ſhould live to reigne and fit upon the throne of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> for ſaith he (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.11. when things went thus with him) <hi>I ſaid in my haſt all men are lyars,</hi> even <hi>Samuel</hi> among the reſt, who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured me of the Kingdome by expreſſe meſſage from God, but ſurely he alſo is deceived, and hath fed me with vaine hopes. Now as theſe words of <hi>David</hi> according to our tranſlation of them, and the truth of the thing in frequent experiences, ſhew, that Godly men are apt to queſtion the truth of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, when themſelves are by ſeemingly contradicting provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences much afflicted; ſo they are apt to queſtion the truth of the threatnings when they ſee outward providences proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the wicked; Therefore when the threatnings have their actuall <hi>yea and Amen,</hi> that is, when they are executed upon the ungodly, this alſo is <hi>to the glory of God by us,</hi> that is, God is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by all his people, who heare of it in the truth of what he hath ſpoken. Againe, as God is magnified in the truth of his threatnings, when any particular wicked man is puniſhed; ſo when common calamities come upon the wicked, the truth of God or God in his truth is magnified two wayes. Firſt, As ſuch calamities are a fullfilling of many Prophecies; ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, As they are the anſwer or returne of many prayers. The vengeance which falls upon the Enemies of the Church of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:153845:105"/> God is drawne out by prayer, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.7, 8. And there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wherein God is more honoured, then when prayer is anſwered; For as therein he fullfills our wants, ſo his owne word; <hi>Who hath not ſaid to the ſeed of Jacob, ſeeke ye mee in vaine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When the wicked fall the Lord is honoured in the attribute of his power; How great is his power, who puls downe great power? It argues the Almightines of God, when he puts the mighty from their ſeates: when the Oaks and the Cedars, when the high walls and mountaines are ſhaken and removed by his blowes and batteries. When <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his Egyptian hoaſt were drowned in the red Sea; Then <hi>Moſes</hi> mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified God in his power (<hi>Exod.</hi> 15.2.) <hi>The Lord is my ſtrength and ſong</hi> (that is, I will ſing of the ſtrength of the Lord, not of the ſtrength of man) <hi>he is my God, and I will prepare him an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; my fathers God and I will exalt him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In theſe three attributes, Juſtice, truth, and power, God is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, when the wicked are deſtroyed, and therfore it cannot be uncomly for the Saints to rejoyce when they are deſtroyed. The Lord by his Prophet aſſures the Church his <hi>Jacob</hi> that all the enemies thereof ſhall be ſcattered. (<hi>Iſ.</hi> 41.15.) <hi>Behold, I will make thee a new ſharpe threſhing inſtrument, having teeth, thou ſhalt threſh the Nations &amp; beat them ſmal, &amp; ſhalt make the hills as chaffe,</hi> &amp;c. The mountains &amp; th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>lls to be threſhed, were the mighty ones of the earth, ſetting themſelves againſt the wayes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of heaven. The Inſtrument or flayle wherewith they were to be threſhed was the <hi>worme Jacob (ver.</hi> 14.) God did not ſo much make an Inſtrument for the <hi>worme Jacob,</hi> as he made the <hi>worme Jacob</hi> his Inſtrument. <hi>Behold, I will make thee,</hi> (not for thee) <hi>a new threſhing Inſtrument;</hi> But when the worme hath done this great worke, when he hath threſhed the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and made the hills as chaffe; What muſt he doe then? The 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe tells, <hi>Thou ſhalt rejoyce in the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gaudebunt de eorum exitio, non vindictae cupiditate, ſed zelo dei accenſi qui hoc modo declarabit ſibi curae eſſe res humanas. <hi>Druſ.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>and ſhalt glory in the holy One of Iſrael.</hi> Glorying is more then rejoycing: Glorying is a kinde of rapture or extaſie of the ſoule. As there is an extaſie of Infatuation, ſo there is an extaſie of Gratious admiration. Fooles and madmen are beſides themſelves for want of reaſon; the wiſeſt and beſt of men, are beſides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves through the aboundance of the Grace of God in them,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:153845:106"/> and the aboundance of the goodneſs of God towards them. When the goodneſs of God acted mightily towards us, meetes with the Grace of God acting mightily in us, we are lifted up ſo farre out of our ſelves, that we can ſee nothing in our ſelves, and then in whom or in what can our rejoycing be, <hi>but in the Lord the holy one of Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This joy is not, Firſt, the joy of the Epicure; A ſenſuall joy, in wine and belly-cheare, in eating the fat, and drinking the ſweete, in carnal merriments &amp; muſicke; nor is this, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a cruel joy in the ruine and deſtruction of men, which the Prophet rebukes (<hi>Obad. v.</hi> 12.) <hi>Thou ſhouldest not have rejoyced over the children of Judah in the day of their deſtruction.</hi> Nor is this, thirdly, a proud joy, or a joy of oſtentation, when men ſpread their plumes, and publiſh their owne wiſdome, greatnes and power; nor is it, fourthly, a covetous joy, ſuch as theirs is who are glad becauſe they have fill'd their purſes, enriched their familyes, and their hand hath gotten much; Nor is it laſtly, a ſecure joy, becauſe when evill men are caſt downe we hope to fit warme and well, ſafe and quiet upon their ruines; But this joy conſiſts; firſt, in high thoughts and valuations of God; <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>This heightens the ſence of the former part of the verſe, not onely are the righteous glad when the wicked are deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but they <hi>laugh them to ſcorne.

                  <p>Yet I conceive <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpeaking here rather upon a generally experienced and poſitive truth, then ſtrictly and particularly aym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at thoſe ancient Examples. <hi>The innocent,</hi> that is, any innocent perſon, whether innocent in reference to the doing of evill, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving eſcaped the ſufferance of evill, <hi>laugh them to ſcorne.</hi>

And therefore as Scriptures of ſuch a tenour are to be interpreted and underſtood in ſuch a manner as becomes and is conſiſtent with the holines of God, ſo alſo (in their proportion) to the holines of the Saints. The laughter of the Saints in theſe diſpenſations is ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and their ſcorning, the acting of their graces, not of their
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:153845:108"/> corruptions.

And thus <hi>Eliah</hi> derided <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, while they wearied themſelves in their fooliſh ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.27.) <hi>And it came to paſſe at noone that Eliah mockt them, and ſaid cry aloud, for he is a God, eyther he is talking,</hi> &amp;c. Thus <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> is expreſſed (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 37.22.) when <hi>Senache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib</hi> ſent up that proud threatning meſſage, the Lord ſent a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable meſſage to his people by <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Prophet; <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God of Iſrael, whereas thou haſt prayed to me againſt Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib the king of Aſſyria, this is the word which the Lord hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken concerning him; the virgin the daughter of Zion hath deſpiſed thee, and laughed thee to ſcorne, the daughter of Jeruſalem hath ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken her head at thee.</hi> The daughter of <hi>Zion,</hi> and the daughter of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> are but one and the ſame; ſhee was called a virgin, not (as ſome have conceived) becauſe ſhe was never taken or forced by any enemy; nor was ſhe ſo called, becauſe he had preſerved her ſelfe pure and chaſt in the worſhip of the true God (For ſhe had her faylings and Idolatrous dalliances before that day) but ſhe was ſo called becauſe of that ſpeciall care which God had of her to protect and ſave her againſt the inſultations of the enemy then ready to aſſault her, even as a virgin is protected from violence in her fathers houſe. And the Prophet to aſſure them that it ſhould be ſo, ſpeakes of the ruine of <hi>Senacheribs</hi> Army, and <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> laughter, as accompliſht and come to paſſe already; <hi>The virgin daughter</hi> &amp;c. <hi>hath deſpiſed thee, and laughed thee to ſcorne, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken her head at thee.</hi> What God ſaith ſhall be done, is as good as done already. The <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> were yet in their Jollity, laughing at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and promiſing themſelves the ſpoyle of the people of God, yet (ſaith the Lord) <hi>Jeruſalem hath laughed thee to ſcorne;</hi> that is, aſſuredly ſhe ſhall. And as the people of God doe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times formally and explicitly laugh at the downfall and whitherings of the wicked, ſo they alwayes virtually and ſecretly laugh them to
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:153845:108"/> ſcorne, even when they ſtand and flouriſh in their greenenes and proſperity; For while the Godly are not daunted with the power and ſplendour, while they are not terrified with the threats and high lookes of the wicked, but in the ſinglenes and ſimplicity of their hearts, keepe cloſe to God, his wayes and truths; even this, though they uſe the dueſt reſpect to them in regard of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, both in word and geſture, is a laughing them to ſcorne; For this is as a thorne in the ſides of evill men, and as a pricke in their eyes, when they ſee they will not ſtoope to their greatnes in any ſinfull complyance with their commands. This is a truth, but the former is the truth intended in this Text.</p>

                  <p>They are the laughter of the innocent, upon more accounts then one.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe they doe ſuch childiſh, and ridiculous things, ſuch things as can never reach the ends they deſire and purpoſe: they are juſtly laughed at, whoſe counſells and courſes are unſuitable, much more, when contrary to their deſignes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Wicked men become ridiculous, while the Lord fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates their wiſeſt counſels, and blaſts thoſe hopes which were bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom'd upon the moſt probable principles and foundations, while he takes them in their own craft, and entraps them in the ſnare which they layd for others.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, While he over-rules all that they plot or act to ſerve his owne ends, and fullfill his owne holy counſels. Hence the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God are ſaid <hi>to pine away; this ſhall be the plague where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Lord will ſmite all the people, that have fought againſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, their fleſh ſhall conſume away while they ſtand upon their feete</hi> (he doth not ſay, that they ſhall all be ſlaine, but their fleſh ſhall conſume away while they ſtand upon their feete) <hi>and their eyes ſhall conſume away in their holes, and their tongue ſhall conſume away in their mouth</hi> (Zech. 14.12.) which as ſome interpret of their bodily languiſhment, that they ſhall live dying continually, or that their life ſhall be a continuall death, ſo all interpret the cauſe of <hi>this conſumption</hi> to ariſe from vexation of ſpirit, becauſe they ſhall ſee themſelves ſcorn'd and laughed at, or that they are become ridiculous to all the world, but chiefly to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>

                     </note> But here he is ſuppoſed entring upon a very ſerious exhortation to repentance, after this manner, or to this effect; <hi>O Job, now while our ſubſtance is not quite out downe, and the fire conſumeth the reſidue or the remnant of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, acquaint thy ſelfe with God;</hi> or apply thy ſelfe to God, as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>before thou art cleane cut downe, before thou art utterly ruined as many wicked men have been heretofore, and now are, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thy ſelfe and ſeeke to God, that thy ſin may be forgiven, and thy wound healed.</hi> Some paralel this in ſenſe with that of the Preacher, <hi>Eccle.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Remember now thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth, while the evill dayes come not, nor the yeares draw nigh wherein thou ſhalt ſay, I have no pleaſure in them.</hi> Thus <hi>Eliphaz</hi> is conceived exhorting <hi>Job, While our ſubſtance is not cut downe, while we are not totally undone,</hi>

                  <q>Whereas our ſubſtance is not cut downe.</q>
                  <p>So this verſe is an elegant concluſion of the whole matter hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto inſiſted upon by <hi>Eliphaz;</hi> and he ſhuts it up in two parts; firſt, ſhewing the ſtate of the innocent, who are brought in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus; <hi>Our ſubſtance is not cut downe.</hi> ſtrictly, That by which we ſtand or ſubſiſt, our ſubſtance or ſubſiſtence; which ſome expound not by goods, but by life; we may take it both wayes, our life, and that by which our life is maintained, or by which we and our fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies ſubſiſt, <hi>is not cut downe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is yet a difficulty in regard of the grammaticall ſenſe of theſe words. For <hi>Eliphaz</hi> having ſpoken before in the third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon plural, <hi>The righteous are glad, and the innocent laugh them to ſcorne,</hi> ſhould (as it may be thought) rather have continued his ſpeech in the ſame forme, and have ſayd; <hi>Whereas Their ſubſtance is not downe,</hi> but he puts it in the firſt perſon plural, <hi>Whereas our ſubſtance is not cut downe</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>We may anſwer two wayes; Firſt, that it is uſuall in Scripture to vary the number, while the ſame perſon or perſons is or are ſpoken of; take onely one Inſtance, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.4. <hi>He</hi> (that is the Angel
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:153845:110"/> of the Covenant) <hi>found him in Bethel,</hi> that is, <hi>Jacob. And there he ſpake with us.</hi> It ſhould according to Grammar be read thus; <hi>And there he ſpake with him.</hi> Having found <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Bethel,</hi> he ſpake with him in <hi>Bethel.</hi> But we ſee both the perſon and number are varied, the former words running in the third perſon ſingular (being meant particularly of <hi>Jacob,</hi>) the latter in the firſt perſon plural, <hi>There he ſpake with us;</hi> The Spirit of God thereby ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, that, what God ſpake at that time to <hi>Jacob</hi> perſonally, he ſpake to all the ſpirituall ſeed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> whether of the Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Uncircumciſion, virtually; He ſo ſpake to <hi>Jacob</hi> as that the ſubſtance and effect of his ſpeech reacheth downe to and hath an influence upon <hi>us,</hi> beleevers, who are his poſterity according to the Spirit. Beſides this, other Scriptures hold out the like variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the number, as in the Text, which is the firſt anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> might purpoſely vary the number, that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe might put in for a ſhare, and be numbred among thoſe, who had obtained that ſparing mercy, not to be cut downe while others were conſumed. And ſo this reaſon of the change is purely ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, much like that laſt opened out of <hi>Hoſea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence note;
<q>That the righteous are often preſerved in common calamities.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>(<hi>Pſal.</hi> 20.8.) <hi>They are brought downe, and are fallen, but we are riſen and ſtand upright, our ſubſtance is not cut downe;</hi> God takes ſpeciall care of his owne people; they are under a promiſe; there can be no greater ſafety, no better ſecurity then to be under a promiſe; the promiſe is the beſt ſhelter in a ſtorme, and the beſt ſhield againſt the dart. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> gives us two famous examples of this, (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5, 6.) <hi>God ſpared not the old world, but ſaved Noah</hi> &amp;c. <hi>bringing in the flood upon the world of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly. And having turned the Cities of Sodome and Gomorrha into aſhes, condemned them with an overthrow</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and delivered just Lot</hi> &amp;c. From both which examples he concludeth (<hi>v.</hi> 9.) <hi>The Lord knoweth how to deliver the Godly out of temptation, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the unjuſt unto the day of Judgement to be puniſhed. When judgement begins at the houſe of God, what ſhall the end of them be that obey not the Goſpel of God?</hi> as the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaks (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17.) It is a ſure argument to the wicked that they ſhall be judged, when they ſee God bringing judgements upon his owne
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:153845:110"/> houſe and people; but the wicked are many times judged while the houſe and people of God are preſerved and untoucht; and when both good and bad, both the innocent, and the wicked are wrapt up in the ſame calamity, when they are (as it were) thruſt together into the ſame furnace, the Lord makes a difference, they are not cut downe as the wicked are cut downe, nor conſumed as they are conſumed. When the righteous are caſt into the fire they are purged but not conſumed, but (as it follows in the ſecond part of this concluſion, ſhewing the ſtate of the wicked)
<q>The remnant of them the fire conſumeth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fire in this place is not taken ſtrictly, as oppoſed to water; God indeed hath often made fire in kinde his ſcourge. And the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith of <hi>Sodome,</hi> That it ſuffered the vengeance of eternall fire. But all the judgements of God are in Scripture compared to fire (<hi>Mala.</hi> 4.1.) <hi>Behold the day cometh that ſhall burne like an Oven, and all the proud, yea all that doe wickedly ſhall be ſtubble, and the day that cometh ſhall burne them up, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, that it ſhall leave them neither fruit nor branch.</hi> There is a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not by fire; There is ſo great a judgement and terror in fire let looſe and breaking its bounds, that it may well ſignifie all judgements, or any thing that is terrible. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.4.) <hi>As the fire devoureth the ſtubble, and the flame conſumeth the chaffe, ſo their roote ſhall be rottenneſſe, and their bloſſome ſhall goe up as duſt.</hi> Thus here, <hi>the remnant of them the fire conſumeth,</hi> that is, the wrath of God appearing in ſome viſible judgement conſumeth the remnant.</p>
                  <p>But what is this <hi>remnant</hi> which the fire conſumeth?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer. Firſt, we may expound it of perſons. The remnant of perſons, all that are left of their family, their children and poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, their kindred and relations are taken away and conſumed from off the face of the earth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may expound it of things, the remnant of goods, whatſoever remaines of their eſtate, the odd ends, the very glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and leavings of their great riches and worldly ſubſtance, are all eaten up and brought to an end, ſo that nothing of them or theirs remaineth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The remnant of them may be <hi>the remembrance</hi> of them. A fire ſhall conſume their name and memoriall, they ſhall neve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note>Fourthly, The word <hi>remnant,</hi> as it ſignifieth in the Original any thing which remaineth, ſo eſpecially that which remaineth in way of excellency, or eminency; not (as we ſay) the fagge end of a thing, but even the uppermoſt and beſt of it. So that (after this tranſlation) <hi>the remnant of them,</hi> is <hi>the excellency of them,</hi> that which they thought moſt durable, and honourable, that which they looked upon as moſt ſubſtantiall and intrinſecall to their greatnes, that very thing <hi>the fire ſhall conſume.</hi> So the word is uſed (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.14.) <hi>Deliver my ſoule from men which are thy hand, O Lord, from men of the world</hi> &amp;c. <hi>whoſe belly thou filleſt with thy hid trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, they are full of children, and leave the reſt</hi> (or as we ſupply, <hi>the reſt of their ſubſtance) to their babes;</hi> the reſt, that is, <hi>the beſt;</hi> their bellies are full of hid treaſures while they live, that is, they have and uſe abundance of the things of this life themſelves; and they <hi>leave the reſt;</hi> he doth not meane the ſcraps or parings after they had filled their owne bellies, but <hi>by the reſt</hi> or the <hi>remnant,</hi> (tis the word of the text) he meaneth the choiceſt of what they had; even that they leave to their babes or children, when them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves muſt be gone and leave the world. Thus we may underſtand the word <hi>remnant</hi> in this place, not for a poore pittance, but for the beſt, the choiſeſt things, for the flower and creame of all they had, even theſe things <hi>the fire ſhall conſume,</hi> vengeance ſhall purſue and follow, till all be turned into ſmoake and aſhes.</p>
                  <p>I have in divers other paſſages of this booke met with Texts ſhewing the utter conſumption of wicked men, therefore I ſhall not ſtay upon it here; onely take this briefe note.</p>
                  <q>That the Lord hath a different fire for the righteous and the wicked.</q>
                  <p>He hath a fire for his owne people, but it is <hi>a purging fire, a cleanſing, a refining fire.</hi> Like that (<hi>Mal.</hi> 3.3.) <hi>He ſhall ſit as a refiner and purifier of ſilver.</hi> The Lord alſo hath a fire for the wicked, but it is a conſuming fire. He kindles many fires upon them, and himſelfe is a conſuming fire to them. But it may be ſaid, that God is a conſuming fire alſo to his owne people; for the Apoſtle ſpeaking of himſelfe and other beleevers, ſaith (<hi>Heb.</hi> 12.29.) <hi>Our God is a conſuming fire.</hi> I anſwer; Firſt, Tis true, the God of Beleevers is a conſuming fire, but he is not a conſuming fire to beleevers; even the hearts of beleevers ought to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:153845:111"/> with a holy feare of that in God, which they ſhall never feele from God. Secondly, God is ſometimes a conſuming fire to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers; but it is onely to conſume their corruptions, or their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible comforts; He will never conſume eyther their Graces or ſpirituall intereſts. Theſe he will not conſume whatſoever he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes. But the whole of a wicked man is as combuſtible matter before him. <hi>There went up a ſmoake out of his noſtrills, fire out of mouth devoured</hi> (Pſal. 18.8.) That is, God powred out wrath, which devoured them like a fire. Fire (I meane naturall fire) is a great devourer, it hath a ſtrong ſtomacke, there's nothing but pure Gold too hard for its digeſtion; but myſticall fire, the fire of divine wrath is infinitely a greater devourer. Wrath kindles ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y devouring fires, but wrath it ſelfe is the moſt devouring fire; who can ſtand before it? who can abide the heate and flames of it? This is the <hi>Tophet</hi> prepared of old for the wicked; This fire is able to conſume branch and ruſh, the roote and top of the wicked in one day, and yet it will continue conſuming them to eternity. <hi>The remnant of them the fire conſumeth.</hi>

                  <q>Acquaint now thy ſelfe with him.</q>
                  <p>The Originall word which we render <hi>to acquaint,</hi> hath ſome variety of ſignifications; As firſt to be familiar with another. And ſo it is uſed by <hi>David</hi> (Pſal. 139.3.) to ſhew the Intimacie which God hath with all our wayes, workes, and thoughts; <hi>O Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) thou haſt ſearched mee and knowne mee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>thou art acquainted with all my wayes;</hi> As if he had ſaid; <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt my wayes infinitely more clearely and diſtinctly, then any of my neereſt acquaintance, who converſe with me every day.</hi> It is uſed 2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> to expreſſe the cuſtomary doing of a thing.

                     </note> one of the Rabbines tranſlates the Text thus; <hi>Profit with God,</hi> as who ſhould ſay, thou haſt been an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſervant to God all this while, be thou now profitable unto him, ſerve him and his Providences, advance his name and glory; or thus rather, Thou haſt but played the truant hitherto, be thou now a good proficient in the ſchoole of Divine doctrine and diſcipline under the holy precepts and various providences of God. We finde it applyed to that fence at the ſecond verſe of this Chapter; <hi>Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wiſe may be profitable to himſelfe?</hi> Man cannot be profitable unto God, or adde any advantage to him by what he doth, but man may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable unto himſelfe, or doe himſelfe good in doing the good will of God; yea God reckons it and rewards man for it, as if he had been profitable to him, when he acts as becomes a faithfull ſervant to him. So ſome expound it here, <hi>be profitable unto God,</hi> be a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and induſtrious ſervant unto him: having received his talents, doe not lay them up in a napkin, hide them not in the earth.</p>

                  <p>Get into a familiarity with God. The word implyeth a likenes, or a ſuitablenes between two in their wills and affections, in their wayes and counſells; for from likeneſſe in theſe familiarity or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance doth ariſe. So that <hi>Eliphaz</hi> here ſpeaketh to <hi>Job</hi> as one that had eſtranged himſelfe and departed from God, as one who had broken off Communion with God; and ſo he muſt needs have done, had he run ſuch a courſe of wickednes as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him with, in the former part of this Chapter. Therefore upon that ſuppoſition he gives <hi>Job</hi> wholeſome advice, <hi>Acquaint not thy ſelfe with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve;
<q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That as man by nature is a ſtranger from God, ſo every act of ſin, eſpecially great and continued actings of ſin breed a further eſtrangement from God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We act the part of nature every time we ſin, and that in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion brings us back in ſome degree to what we were by nature, <hi>ſtrangers unto God.</hi> A godly man (who hath had acquaintance with God) ſinning puts back his acquaintance, &amp; a diſtance grows between God and him. Beleevers after great ſins and follyes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, are not forward to come into the preſence of God, they have a kinde of liſtleſnes to duty, a liſtleſnes to prayer, and to all acts of communion with God. And God himſelfe appeares as if he did not much care for them when they come, they have not thoſe Communications from God which he uſually vouchſafeth his, God doth not give them the meeting as formerly; they doe not
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:153845:113"/> finde the Lord preſently, though they ſeeke him earneſtly. So that both wayes there is an Eſtrangement; ſin ſeparates between God and the ſoule, not onely judicially but naturally. If God ſhould not depart from ſinners, or command them to depart from him, yet they would of themſelves depart from him. It is not poſsible for one, who willingly lives in ſin, to live willingly in the preſence of God; For as to be caſt out of the preſence of God, is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treameſt puniſhment of wicked men, ſo alſo is their being in his preſence. The ſame thing is both their deſire and their puniſhment. They are puniſhed with a departure from God, and they deſire nothing more then to be out of his preſence.</p>
                  <q>Acquaint thy ſelfe now with God.</q>
                  <p>Secondly, Whereas <hi>Eliphaz</hi> exhorting <hi>Job</hi> to repentance, counſells him to acquiant himſelfe with God.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>That Repentance is the renewing of our Communion or acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As ſin is a turning from God, ſo repentance is a returning to God; 'tis a change firſt of our minde, and then of our way. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paenitency brings the ſoule into an acquaintance and unholy fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with Satan; Repentance brings backe the ſoule into its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer acquaintance, and holy familiarity with God. As the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion (which is from a ſtate of ſin) ſo the ſecond and every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed converſion (which is from our falls into ſin) renewes our converſe with the moſt high.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, take this generall obſervation;
<q>A godly man is (as we may ſay) one of Gods Acquaintants or familiars.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God calleth <hi>Abraham</hi> his friend; friendſhip cannot be without familiarity, there muſt be acquaintance before there can be love, if therefore there be friendſhip and love between God and man, there muſt be Acquaintance; we cannot love eyther perſons or things, while unknowne.</p>
                  <p>But it may be ſaid, how can wee, who are at ſuch a diſtance, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint our ſelves with God?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, wee (who of our ſelves are a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:153845:114"/> by the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, and being thus made nigh in our ſtate, wee draw nigh or acquaint our ſelves with him by ſeverall Acts. As firſt, To thinke or meditate of God, is to acquaint our ſelves with and draw nigh to God; meditation is an inward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and converſe with God, it is a Soliloquie between God and the ſoule; acquaintance is got by Conference: when friends meet and confer, that doth not onely begin, but confirme, ſtrengthen, and highten their acquaintance. Saints have many thoughts of God, and that's their acquaintance with God. <hi>How precious are thy thoughts to mee, O God!</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 139.17.) <hi>how great is the ſumme of them! when I awake I am ſtill with thee.</hi> How was <hi>David</hi> ſtill or ever with God? He was ſo in his thoughts, and meditations, in the actings &amp; goings forth of his ſoule to him. Now he that is ſtill or ever with a perſon, muſt needs be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him, <hi>I am ſtill with thee,</hi> alwayes meditating upon thee. We finde him againe in the ſame holy frame (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.5, 6.) <hi>My ſoule ſhall be ſatisfied as with marrow and fatnes, and my mouth ſhall praiſe thee with joyfull lips; while I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.</hi> As the Lord is ever thinking upon his people, they are written upon his heart, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon the palmes of his hand, and when his outward actings towards them are ſuch, as may ſeeme to intimate that his heart is withrawne from all intimacy with them, yet even then he thinks moſt of them. This he acknowledgeth concerning <hi>Ephraim</hi> (Jer. 31.20.) <hi>Since I ſpake againſt him I doe earneſtly remember him ſtill.</hi> Since I ſpake againſt him, that is, ſince I ſpake againſt him by words of rebuke and correction, ſince I ſpake againſt him by rods of chaſtiſement and correction, (as <hi>Ephraim</hi> found and confeſſed he had <hi>Thou didſt chaſtiſe mee and I was chaſtiſed</hi>) ſince I ſpake thus againſt him, <hi>I do earneſtly remember him ſtill.</hi> I remember him, and I remember him ſtrongly, my heart is much upon him. And when the Lord ſaith thus, wee are not to underſtand it, as a man will remember an Enemy, when he ſpeaks againſt him; hee'le re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him indeed, and that earneſtly to plot miſchiefe againſt him, and to execute his revenge; but the meaning is, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him in mercy, my affections goe out to him, my bowels are moved towards him. Such is the remembrance which God had of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> even when he was ſpeaking againſt him and ſmiting him. Now as the Lord doth remember his people at all times, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:153845:114"/> remember them at ſometimes. So his people in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion doe earneſtly remember the Lord, they minde him often, they would minde him alwayes, they like to retaine God (which the natural man liketh not, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28.) in their knowledge, or to acknowledge God; They have not ſome flitting tranſient thoughts and acknowledgements of God (as a carnall man may have) but they fix and retaine God in their thoughts &amp; acknowledgements, they thinke of God, what he is in his nature, they thinke what God is in all his perfections, they meditate of all his glory, of his juſtice, of his mercy, of his faithfulnes, of his power, of his truth, of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeablenes, of his all-ſufficiency, they acquaint themſelves with God in all theſe; for indeed we are never acquainted with God, till we come to a diſtinct knowledge of him in all theſe parts of his glory, which yet are all but one and the ſame glorious God. To know onely in generall that there is a God, is not to acquaint our ſelves with God; our acquaintance with him conſiſts in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and fiduciall knowledge of all his revealed perfections, ſo farre as it is poſſible or lawfull for man to ſearch and know. To be acquainted with any man, notes more than a generall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, how much more to be acquainted with God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Wee acquaint our ſelves with God, not onely when wee ſtudy his nature, or what he is, but when we ſtudy his workes, or what he hath done, God is viſible in his workes. <hi>That his name is neare, his wondrous workes declare</hi> (Pſal. 75.1.) Wee may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint our ſelves much with God in the workes of Creation, but more in the workes of Providence, in thoſe wee may moſt legibly read his name, that is, his greatnes and power, as alſo his goodnes and mercy.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Wee acquaint our ſelves with God in the ſtudy of his word; there he hath made a full diſcovery of himſelfe and of his will; <hi>O how I love thy Law</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) my meditation is in it might and day.</hi> The word of God is the demonſtration of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of God. There he hath ſet forth himſelfe, how juſt, how pure, and how gracious he is. The word is a glaſſe in which God is ſeene, therefore acquaint thy ſelfe with the word of God, and thou ſhalt be acquainted with God; reading and hearing the word of God is our going to God for Counſell, as wee acquaint our ſelves with a man when we goe to him, and aske his advice and counſel in any matter, or conſult his bookes; ſo every time we ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:153845:115"/> read or heare the word of God in faith, we are asking coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God, and ſo acquainting our ſelves with him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Wee, eſpecially, acquaint our ſelves with God in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. That is nothing elſe but the opening of our hearts to God, a declaring of our wants to him, <hi>Prayer is the aſcending, the lifting up of the ſoule to God,</hi> therefore in prayer wee acquaint our ſelves with God.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Our daily holy walking, is a daily acquainting our ſelves with God, every ſtep of a holy life is both towards and with God; the life of <hi>Enoch</hi> (who was too holy for a life here on earth, and therefore he <hi>was tranſlated that he ſhould not ſee death,</hi> his life I ſay) is deſcribed thus, <hi>Enoch walked with God</hi> (Gen. 5.24.) God and <hi>Enoch</hi> were like two familiars or intimate friends walking toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; And becauſe he took ſo much delight in Gods acquaintance, God took him from all acquaintance with men; ſo ſaith that text; <hi>Enoch walked with God, and was not, for God tooke him.</hi> He was ſo taken with God, that God took him, or as the Authour to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> ſaith, <hi>tranſlated him</hi> (ch. 11.5.) He was before tranſlated from nature to Grace, &amp; he proved ſo great a proficient in that ſchoole, that he was tranſlated from Grace to Glory (as it were <hi>per ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>) by a leape over the grave; for he ſaw not death; From which ſad viſion, but one more (that I read of in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Elias</hi> by name) was excuſed before he was admitted to the beatificall viſion. <hi>Holy walking is the ſumme of all our acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God; and our fulleſt acquaintance with God is but the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of our holy walkings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To draw towards a cloſe of this poynt; wee may take notice, That there is a twofold acquaintance with God; Firſt, from neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, when wee come to him and deſire to have to doe with him, preſt with our owne wants, feares, or afflictions; of this the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaketh (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.16.) <hi>Lord in trouble have they viſited thee, they have poured out a prayer when thy chaſtening was upon them.</hi> And of this the Pſalmiſt ſpeake (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.34.) <hi>When he ſlew them they ſought him, and they returned and enquired early after God: nevertheleſſe, they did but flatter him with their mouth,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe make God their refuge not their choice; They, I grant, who have made God their choice in good times, may comfortably make him their refuge in evill times. But to neglect God while it is well with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and onely to run to him when it is ill with us, or to have our
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:153845:115"/> evills and burdens removed, is to acquaint our ſelves with God, becauſe we cannot chooſe, or becauſe we cannot be without him, not becauſe we have choſen him, or deſire to be with him. As there is a patience, ſo there is an acquaintance, perforce. Though God doth not refuſe acquaintance with many poore ſoules, when their neceſſities drive them to him, yet it is beſt to acquaint our ſelves with him for the love we beare to him, or the deſire we have to enjoy him, rather then (though we all have need of him, and are bound to come to him becauſe we have) for the need we have of him. And therefore, ſecondly, there is an acquaintance with God from pure love. As when we come to a friend, having nothing to do but to ſee him, &amp; to renew or ſtrengthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our acquaintance with him. Wee doe not come to load him with our cares, or adviſe with him about our buſineſſes, or deſire a curteſie of him, but, meerly &amp; pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſhew our love to him. Thus to come to God when we are not preſt with feares, nor pincht with wants, nor clouded with doubts, nor vexed with troubles, is the moſt noble &amp; ingenuous way of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting our ſelves with him. When we (as it were) make a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to God, having nothing to doe with him, but to viſit him and to deſire further communion with him, nothing to do with him but to behold his excellency and his glory, nothing to do with him, but to tell him what our hearts are towards him, how we love him, how we depend upon him, how we deſire to pleaſe him, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our wayes to him, to acquaint God with thoſe things which onely concerne our holy walking with him, this is to ſeeke pure acquaintance with him. The Lord ſaith of <hi>Abraham</hi> his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant or friend (<hi>Gen.</hi> 18.17.) <hi>Shall I hide from Abraham the thing that I am about to doe?</hi> I ſhould not deale with him as with my friend, if I did ſo. A friend who is as our owne ſoule (<hi>Deut.</hi> 13.6.) ſhould know all that is in our ſoules. Now as God (whether we will or no) is acquainted with all that is in our ſoules; So a ſoule acquainted with God, will let him know all; ſhall I hide from God the thing that I am about to doe? ſhall I not tell him how it is with me? To acquaint our ſelves thus with God is a ſweete and precious duty. Much might be ſaid about it; I ſhall onely adde theſe two things; Firſt, That all our acquaintance with God muſt be had through the mediator; There is no getting neere the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but by the Son. Secondly, That the more we are acquainted with God, the more we are tranſformed into his likenes. Some
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:153845:116"/> have altered the habit of their bodyes, yea, the diſpoſitions of their mindes by long acquaintance with others; and have looked or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared like them, by often looking upon or being with them. When <hi>Moſes</hi> had been forty dayes in the Mount talking with God, his face ſhone, ſome rayes of a divine glory darted out from him, ſo that <hi>Aaron and the children of Iſrael were afraid to come nigh him</hi> (Exod. 34.30.) And thus every one who gets up into the Mount by faith, and acquaints himſelfe with God, gets ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of God, which will draw a reverence upon him among men. As when Chriſt ſhall appeare hereafter to us in glory, <hi>we ſhall be like him</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> 1 Ep: 3.2.) for we ſhall ſee him as he is; ſo according to the ſight which we have of and our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Chriſt in the wayes of grace here, will our likenes be unto him. <hi>The more we are with God, the more we have of God. Acquaint now thy ſelfe with him,</hi>
                     <q>and be at peace.</q>

                     </note>Firſt, it may be taken as an Effect of what was ſaid before, <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint thy ſelfe with God, and be at peace,</hi> that is, <hi>If thou acquaint thy ſelfe with God, thou ſhalt have peace.</hi> So in the Hebrew often the Imperative mood is put for the future tenſe, as, <hi>Doe this and live,</hi> (according to the tenure of the Covenant of works) that is, <hi>Doe this, and thou ſhalt live,</hi> So <hi>acquaint thy ſelfe with him, and be at peace,</hi> that is, thou ſhalt have peace. Peace comprehends all good; good of the minde, good of the body, good of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. When the Hebrewes ſay, <hi>Peace be unto you,</hi> they ſay as much in that one word as the Greeks ſay in three; whereof the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the welfare of the minde; the ſecond, the welfare or health of the body; and the third the ſucceſſe of all our affaires and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings. So that while <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſaith to <hi>Job</hi> according to this reading, <hi>Thou ſhalt be at peace,</hi> it is a promiſe of all manner of good flowing in upon the renewing of his acquaintance with, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to a reverentiall converſe with God. But becuſe this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe followes in the next words, <hi>thereby good ſhall come unto thee,</hi> therefore I underſtand this clauſe as a duty, and not as a promiſe <hi>Acquaint now thy ſelfe with him, and be at peace.</hi> To be <hi>at peace,</hi> is a diſtinct duty from that of acquainting our ſelves with God, yet neceſſarily following upon it; The words may have theſe two things in them.</p>

Thou haſt ſtrugled enough already, now lay aſide all impatiency and paſſion, all diſcontents and animoſities, as doe not rage and rave, doe not diſtemper and diſcompoſe thy ſelfe as thou haſt done; There is a ſtorme upon thee, but be thou of a calme and quiet ſpirit, kiſſe the rod, be not angry with it; wee may expreſſe this frame by that which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> makes the chiefe adorning, or ornament of a woman, that ſhe be of <hi>a meek and a quiet ſpirit, which with God is of great price;</hi> As meeknes is a Jewell of the greateſt price that women can weare; ſo it is a moſt rich and precious Jewell for a man to weare; and as at all times, ſo then eſpecially meeknes and peaceablenes of ſpirit becomes man, when God ſeemes to come in anger and to be at warre with him. <hi>Bildad</hi> ſayd of <hi>Job (Chap.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 4.) <hi>He teareth himſelfe in his anger;</hi> As if he had ſayd, the man's mad or diſtracted; now <hi>Eliphaz</hi> adviſeth him, Be at peace, be quiet; This is a good interpretation, and wee may note from it,
<q>That it is our Duty to ſit downe quiet and ſatisfied under the ſaddeſt diſpenſations of God.</q>

God catcheth his owne people in his net many times as well as the wicked. His owne people are like a dove in a net, but the wicked are like a wild Bul in a net. I grant, the Doves will flutter a while when the net hath caught them. Impatiency doth often breake out in the beſt of Saints: it is a hard thing to keep the heart quiet within while our eſtate is unquiet without, and to be at peace in our ſelves, when God ſeemes to be at warre with us. It is hard for us to hold our peace, much more to be at peace in an afflicted

After treating comes peace; As peace is <hi>the fruit of the lips</hi> (Iſa. 57.19.) when God treates with man by man, ſo when man treats with man, and when man treats with God. <hi>Acquaint now thy ſelfe with him,</hi> call for a treaty, and therein make thy peace, <hi>Be at peace with him,</hi> do not any longer continue thy unholy warre with God. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſuppoſing <hi>Job</hi> as a man ſetting himſelfe againſt God, had reaſon to beſpeake him thus.</p>

                  <q>That when wee are eſtranged from God, good is eſtranged from us.</q>
                  <p>God can ſtop the Influences of all our mercies from us, he can lay an embargo upon all Creatures from bringing any good to us, the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:153845:118"/> there be ſtore of treaſure and rich Commodity in the place, yet he can barre up all, that no good can come unto us; yea, the Lord in ſuch caſes doth often lay a ſtop upon the ſpirit of prayer in his own people, and when the heart is ſtopt that we cannot pray, then uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally good is ſtopt and kept back from coming to us; Prayer is that which fetches in mercy and good things through the love of God in Jeſus Chriſt. Prayer may have a twofold ſtop. Firſt, prayer may have a ſtop in the heart; ſecondly, Prayer which comes forth of the heart may have a ſtop in heaven, the Lord doth even ſhut out-pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſometimes, and when prayer is ſhut out, no good can get out to us. Prayer is ſent upon a meſſage to heaven, and if our meſſenger be ſhut out of doores and not admitted in, what anſwer can we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect by his meſſage. And the Lord as he doth ſtop ſuch from the receiving of further good, ſo from the receiving of good by what they have already. Wee may have that which in the nature of it is good, and yet have no good by it; God can ſtop the creature in our hands, that it ſhall not at all give us any Comfort, as well as he can ſtop any creature-comfort from comming into our hands. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the Lord (in one ſence) ſtop the creature, it quickly leakes out all the Comfort which he hath put into it, and proves to us indeed, what ſin hath made it, <hi>a broken Ciſtern;</hi> And unleſſe the Lord open the creature, the creature cannot give forth that good w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> it hath; It will be to us as a Ciſterne without a vent to paſſe out the water for our uſe. There's many a one who hath enough in his hand (take it in any kinde) but he enjoyes nothing of it, becauſe the Lord locks up the conduit, or the ciſterne, and then how much good ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is in it, there's none for him. It is all one to us, whether we have onely a broken Ciſterne for our portion, or a Ciſterne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes lockt up; for as the one lets all the water run out, ſo the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holds all the water in; we are as farre from good, if our Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne hold all, as if it held nothing at all. It is then not onely our duty and our holines to acquaint our ſelves and be at peace with God, but our wiſdome and our intereſt; For it is as he pleaſeth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, and uſually as we pleaſe him, that eyther we have any thing that is good comming to us, or that any good commeth to us by that which we have.</p>

                     <hi>So ſhall good come unto thee.</hi> There was never any man a looſer by acquaintance with God; Gods acquaintance is a gainfull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; Our acquaintance with God, ſhould we conſider it abſtractly and ſeparate from all benefit but his very acquaintance, yet that is benefit enough; God is the chiefeſt Good, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we enjoy him, we enjoy all Good. The enjoyment of God himſelfe is infinitely more then the enjoyment of all created good things that come from God. Friends are ſometimes in thoſe heights of friendſhip and noblenes of ſpirit one to another, that they count the enjoyment of one another to be more then all the benefits they can heape upon or reape by one another; it is your good Company, ſaith ſuch a friend, and your acquaintance that delights me more then all the good you can beſtow upon mee. And is not God much more ſo to us? Thus (I ſay) acquaintance with God alone is all good; but beſides (as the poynt leads us to conſider) God gives out good things from himſelfe, to all his holy acquaintants, temporall or bodily, good comes to us by his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and ſo alſo (and that chiefly) doth ſpirituall or ſoule good. Acquaint thy ſelfe with God, and the dewes of grace, ſhowers of the Spirit ſhall fall into thy boſome. Acquaint thy ſelfe with God, and ſpirituall Comfort ſhall flow in unto thee, ſpirituall ſtrength ſhall flow in unto thee, thy ſoule ſhall be filled as with marrow and fatnes. And as good ſhall come to thee in perſon, ſo to thine; to thy family and poſterity good ſhall come. And as God will cauſe good to come to ſuch, ſo to ſtay and abide with them. As good comes, ſo good continues according to the command and commiſſion which it hath from God. Thus he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in the Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.18.) in caſe his people had hark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his commandements; <hi>Then had thy peace been as a River, and thy proſperity as the waves of the Sea.</hi> Thy peace and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity had not been as a Land flood or Brooks of water which faile in ſummer when we have moſt need of them, (all worldly things are apt to doe ſo) but they ſhould have flowed perpetually as a river doth, which is fed by a conſtant Spring, or as the Sea doth which is the feeder of all Springs. A godly man gets not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a large portion of good things, but a laſting portion, yea a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:153845:120"/> of thoſe good things which are everlaſting, by acquainting himſelfe with God. And becauſe by acquaintance with God ſo much good comes to us, Therefore <hi>Eliphaz</hi> preſſeth <hi>Job</hi> further to it in the next verſe.</p>

                  <p>Further, The word which we expreſſe <hi>Receive,</hi> is rendred by ſome to <hi>buy;</hi> we may connect both ſences here, Receive the Law as a thing bought and carry it home with thee.

But the Prophet vvho ſpeakes of corporall bread and vvater in the former part of the verſe, ſpeakes of ſpirituall raine in the latter, making this ſo full a compenſation to the people of God, for the want of other tvvo, that they ſhould have no cauſe to complain of it. As if the Prophet had ſaid, <hi>Though you are cut ſhort in outward things, yet you ſhall not be ſhortned in ſpiritualls, the raine of holy doctrine ſhall not be removed from you,</hi> or as vve tranſlate, <hi>thy teachers ſhall not be removed</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>But you vvill ſay, What is this Lavv vvhich comes dovvne like raine from heaven? and vvhich vve are to receive from the mouth of God.</p>
                  <p>I anſvver; The Lavv may be taken tvvo vvayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Strictly for the ten Commandements, or the five Bookes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> vvhich are called the Lavv.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, More largely, and ſo the vvhole vvord of God is the Lavv. Chriſt himſelfe calls the Booke of <hi>Pſalmes</hi> the Lavv tvvo or three times in the nevv Teſtament (<hi>Joh.</hi> 10.34.) <hi>Jeſus anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, is it not written in your Law, I have ſaid yee are Gods?</hi> vvhere vvas that vvritten? in the 82<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                     <hi>Pſal. v.</hi> 6. And ſo againe (<hi>Joh.</hi> 15.25.) <hi>But this cometh to paſſe, that the word might be fullfilled that is written in their Law, they hated me without a cauſe.</hi> What Lavv doth he meane? thoſe vvords vve finde (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.19.) Take one text further (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.21.) <hi>In the Law it is written, With men of other tongues, and other lips, will I ſpeake unto this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Where is that vvritten? (<hi>Eſay</hi> 28.11.) So that the <hi>Law,</hi> in a large ſenſe, is taken for the vvhole body of the vvord of God, or for the general Revelation of the myſterie of his vvill; in vvhich ſenſe vvee may ſay the Goſpel is the Lavv; And the Goſpel is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely called the <hi>Law</hi> (or rule) <hi>of faith</hi> (Rom. 3.27.) So that by <hi>Law</hi> here vve may underſtand vvhatſoever the Lord hath given us, eyther as a rule of life, or as a rule of faith. The Seaventy tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpeaking in that latitude,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Receive whatſoever God delivers, declares, or puts forth. Receive, I pray thee, the Law</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>From vvhoſe mouth? from the mouth of God; how can that be? Indeed <hi>Moſes</hi> vvent up into the Mount, and vvas vvith God fourty dayes, and there received the Lavv from his mouth; but could <hi>Job</hi> Receive the Lavv from his mouth as <hi>Moſes</hi> did? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvver; If God had called him to it, as he did <hi>Moſes</hi> he might. But
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:153845:123"/> that's not the purpoſe of <hi>Eliphaz.</hi> Neither are wee (I conceive) to underſtand him of ſuch a <hi>Receiving from the mouth of God,</hi> as the old Prophets had vvho received the minde of God by Immediate Inſpiration, &amp; dictates from God himſelfe: for though they vvere not called up ſolemnly into a Mount (as <hi>Moſes</hi>) to receive the Lavv, yet the Spirit was ſent to make knowne the minde of God to them. And in that ſence the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> is ſaid to warne King <hi>Zedekiah from the mouth of the Lord</hi> (2 Chron. 36.12.) <hi>And he did that which was evill in the ſight of the Lord his God, and humbled not himſelfe before Jeremiah the Prophet ſpeaking from the mouth of the Lord;</hi> that is, he received a vvord from God by an Extraordinary Revelation to carry unto the King, vvho yet humbled not himſelfe. And ſo (<hi>Eſay</hi> 30.2.) the Lord complaines of his people <hi>that walked to goe downe to Aegypt to ſtrengthen themſelves with the ſtrength of Pharaoh</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and yet had not asked at his mouth,</hi> that is, had not asked direction in the thing according to the vvayes of Revelation then in uſe, by enquiring of the Prophets, or of the high Prieſt; And the Lord tels the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> (Ch. 15.19.<note place="margin">Prophetae ſunt quaſi os dei quia per ipſos loquutus eſt.</note>) <hi>that he ſhould be as his mouth if he would take forth the precious from the vile,</hi> as if he had ſayd, if thou art faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in my vvork, I will reveale my ſelfe to thee, &amp; thou ſhalt ſpeak even as if I my ſelfe ſpoke, thou ſhalt be as my mouth. Now, I conceive, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> doth not goe thus high when he bids <hi>Job Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Law from the mouth of God,</hi> as if he vvere to expect Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate direction and advice from him. For then, we may be ſayd to receive a rule or a law from the mouth of God, when vve re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that which God hath manifeſted at any time as a rule and lavv for us vvith the reſt of his people to walke by: they vvho re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that law once delivered from the mouth of God, may be ſaid to receive the lavv from his mouth, though they are not the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate receivers of it, yea, though it were publiſhed ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of yeares before they vvere borne. Some from theſe words, collect that the books of <hi>Moſes</hi> vvere written before this time, and that <hi>Eliphaz</hi> did referre <hi>Job</hi> to thoſe, bidding him receive that lavv which the mouth of God had ſpoken to <hi>Moſes,</hi> but, though whether the law vvere then formally ſpoken or no is a diſpute, yet it is vvithout all diſpute, that the mouth of God had then given a lavv or rule of life to his people: and ſo <hi>Eliphaz</hi> might ſafely and truely ſay, <hi>Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth,</hi> there ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:153845:124"/> been a Revelation of the minde of God among the faithfull in all ages and times. God never left his people to their own will, nor them to be their own Guide and Counſeller. For when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſayth (<hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14.) that <hi>the Gentiles having not the law are a law unto themſelves;</hi> his meaning is not that they had no law but one of their own deviſing. They indeed had not the law of God formally ſpoken to their eares, and preſerved in tables of ſtone, but they had the ſubſtance of the law of God naturally vvritten in their hearts. So then, there hath alwayes been a lavv from his mouth formally in the Church, &amp; naturally in the world. Therefore ſaith <hi>Eliphaz, Receive the law from his mouth,</hi> and when he ſaith, <hi>Receive the law from his mouth,</hi> it may have a double Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To the vvill and vviſdome of <hi>Job;</hi> As if <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Thou haſt been hitherto a law to thy ſelfe,</hi> that is, thou haſt follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy own advice,<note place="margin">Ex ore ejus notanter dicit, <hi>i. e.</hi> non ex ore aut arbitrio tuo. <hi>Merc.</hi>
                     </note> run on upon thy own head, now Receive the lavv from his mouth. Man, naturally hath high thoughts of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and vvould be a law to himſelfe. Not as (<hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. which place vvas touched before) <hi>The Gentiles not having a law, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>re a law to themſelves;</hi> that is, they had the law of God written in their hearts by nature; but beſides that, there is a lavv which man vvould be to himſelfe againſt that law of nature vvritten in his heart, and againſt the light of nature ſhining in his conſcience, he would ſet up a law, even his own Luſt, in oppoſition to the law of God. Thus he vvould be a law to himſelfe, and not <hi>Receive a law from the mouth of God.</hi> Therefore ſaith <hi>Eliphaz;</hi> Now, <hi>receive the law from his mouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, (from his mouth) may be oppoſed to the mouthes of others; as if he ſhould ſay, if thou wilt not truſt us, nor take our vvord, then truſt God, vve vvould not have thee depend upon us, nor upon any man living, not on the Judgement or Authority of any Creature, but receive the lavv from his mouth; there is a law and a truth come from God, let thy faith be guided, and thy life ordered by that.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <q>It is our duty to receive the rule from God.</q>
                  <p>The Lord hath povver to give us the law, and vve muſt receive the lavv from him. None have povver to Impoſe a lavv upon us but God himſelfe, nor may we deviſe a lavv for our ſelves; <hi>God is
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:153845:124"/> the onely Maſter of the Conſcience,</hi> he alone can ſay, <hi>Receive the law at my mouth.</hi> If you aske, vvhat is it to receive the law? I anſvver, it is more then to give it the hearing. To receive, is, firſt, to beleeve the lavv; ſecondly, to receive, is to honour and reverence the law; thirdly, to receive the lavv, is to yeeld up our ſelves to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it, to be caſt into the mould of it, to ſubject our ſelves vvholly to the minde of God in it; Then vve receive the lavv vvhen vve take the Impreſſions of it, &amp; have as it vvere the Image and ſtampe of it upon our ſpirits, and in our lives; fourthly, then we receive it vvhen as it followes in the Text, <hi>we lay up his word in our hearts;</hi> barely to receive it is not enough, you muſt lay it up, treaſure it up.</p>
                  <q>And lay up his word in thy heart.</q>
                  <p>This is oppoſed,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To forgetfullnes of the vvord,<note place="margin">Praecedentis partis ex poſitio &amp; amplificatio. Ita legem ſuſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe ut <hi>ponas</hi> proprie, <hi>diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> arte cura ſollicitudine obſervandi.</note> Receive the lavv and let it not ſlip out of thy memory.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is oppoſ'd to negligence in the practice of the law; lay it up that it may be forth comming to direct thee in every duty. In Converſion the law is vvritten in the heart; every godly man hath a Copie of the lavv in his heart; That's the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a godly man, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.31.) <hi>The law of God is in his heart, none of his ſteps ſhall ſlide;</hi> vvhich is not an univerſall exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all fayling &amp; ſlipping, as if every godly man were as much paſt ſinning, as he is paſt periſhing: but vvhen 'tis ſayd, <hi>none of his ſteps,</hi> the meaning is, few of his ſteps ſhall ſlide, or he ſhall never ſlide ſo in any of his ſteps as not to recover his feete and get up againe. He ſhall vvalke very holily, ſo holily as if all his vvalkings vvere but one continued act of holines. But, to the text, None of his ſteps ſhall ſlide quite and for ever out of the vvay, becauſe the law of God is in his heart. What <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes in that propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Pſalme of Chriſt (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.8.) <hi>Thy law is within my heart,</hi> is true in its degree of every Chriſtian, all the lawes of God are in his heart. That Character is againe given of them (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.5.) <hi>In whoſe heart are thy wayes;</hi> there is a ſuiting of the minde of God and the heart of man together in regeneration. But novv the duty ſpoken of in the Text is another thing; for a man that hath the lavv vvritten in his heart, may yet poſſibly forget to lay up the vvord and law of God in his heart, he may (under temptation and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:153845:125"/> the preſſures of corruption) be negligent in that; it is the worke of a godly man, who hath the lavv of God in his heart already, continually to lay up the law in his heart; and ſo vve are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſuch Scriptures as theſe (<hi>Pro.</hi> 7.3.) <hi>Keepe my Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and live, and my law as the apple of thine eye, binde them on thy fingers, write them on the table of thine heart</hi> &amp;c. The firſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the law in the heart is by the finger of the Spirit, by Gods own finger. As it was God that firſt wrote the lavv in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of ſtone vvith his own finger, ſo it is he that writes the law in theſe fleſhy Tables of the heart by the finger of the Spirit: yet <hi>Solomon</hi> perſwades his ſon to vvrite the law upon the Table of his heart: vvhen grace is received, and the law once written in our hearts, vve doe as it vvere put in ſeverall freſh Copies of the law, vve are continually writing divine notions and Inſtructions upon our hearts; this renewed act is aſcribed to us, becauſe we through grace joyne in it. We have an Expreſſion of like import (<hi>Pro.</hi> 4.21.) <hi>My Son attend to my words, encline thine eare to my ſayings; let them not depart from thine eyes, keep them in the midſt of thine heart.</hi> The heart is ſaid to be the midſt or Center of the body, now, ſaith he, <hi>keep the law in the very midſt of thine heart,</hi> in the ſafeſt place; as the heart is the ſafeſt place the middle of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſo the middle of the heart is the ſafeſt place of the heart. So vve may underſtand that of <hi>David, I have hid thy Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in my heart</hi> (Pſal. 119.11.) And (<hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6.) <hi>Theſe words which I command thee this day, ſhall be in thine heart;</hi> that is, <hi>thou ſhalt lay them up there.</hi> Of this laying up the law in the heart vve are to underſtand <hi>Eliphaz</hi> here; as if he had ſayd; <hi>O Job, thou haſt often heard of the law, but thou haſt been a forgetfull hearer; now heare it, and hold it, now</hi> (as the Apoſtle exhorts the <hi>Hebrewes, Heb.</hi> 2.1.) <hi>give the more earneſt heed to the things, which thou hast heard, or ſhalt hereafter heare, leſt at any time thou ſhouldeſt let them ſlip, or thou ſhouldeſt run out</hi> (as we there put in the margin) <hi>as a leaking veſſel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, This laying up the vvord in the heart, is oppoſd unto a bare barren knowledge; it is not enough to have the vvord of God in our heads, that is, to know it: it is not enough to have the word of God upon our tongues, that is, to ſpeake of it, but we muſt lay it up in the heart; For though the heart, in Scripture, takes in the underſtanding, and the whole ſoule, yet chiefly it reſpects the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:153845:125"/> affections; <hi>lay up the word in thine heart,</hi> that is, let thy affections be vvarm'd with it, vvhile thy memory retaines and keepes it, and thy underſtanding is enlightened vvith a true notion of it.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The word of God is a precious thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We doe not lay up trifles and traſh, but precious things, and treaſure; vve lay up our Plate and Jewells, our Gold and Silver; the vvord of God ſhould be more to us than thouſands of gold and ſilver, it is the moſt precious Jewell, 'tis treaſure, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be laid up.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The heart is the Arke or Cabinet, in which the word muſt be laid up.</q>
                  <p>There was an Arke or Cheſt provided for the law (<hi>Exod.</hi> 25.21.) and that Arke was Chriſt, he was typified by it, and indeed the law would be too hot for our hearts, too hot to lye there if it had not firſt layne in the heart of Chriſt; wee (ſince fallen) could never have been an Arke for it, if he had not been. The tables of the law were laid in the Arke, and the Arke (in which the lavv vvas put) had a mercy-ſeat vvhich did cover it all over (The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of the Arke and of the mercy-ſeate were exactly the ſame, two cubits and a halfe in length, and a cubit and a halfe in breadth, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 25.10.17.) ſo that nothing of the law could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare or riſe up in Judgement againſt poore ſinners. The propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory or mercy-ſeate covered all. Now as Chriſt hath been the Arke of the law to protect and cover us from the condemning power of it; ſo the hearts of beleevers muſt be the Arke of the law, where it muſt be layd up with a readines of minde to yeeld our ſelves up to the commanding power of it. <hi>David</hi> prophecying of Chriſt ſaith (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.10.) <hi>I have not hid thy righteouſneſſe within my heart,</hi> yet he had ſaid before, <hi>I delight to doe thy will, thy law is within my heart.</hi> To cleare which Scripture take notice that there is a twofold hiding of the righteouſneſſe or vvord of God in the heart. Firſt, ſo as to obſcure or conceale it from others, in that ſence <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have not hid thy righteouſneſſe in mine heart, I have declared thy faithfullnes and thy ſalvation, and not concealed thy loving kindneſſe and truth from the great Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And thus no man ought to lay up the truths, the law, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God in his heart to conceale and ſtifle them there. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:153845:126"/> There is a hiding of the law in our hearts, firſt, that it may be ſafe, leſt Satan or the world ſhould ſnatch it from us. Secondly, That we may further conſider of it; when a man hath got an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent truth, or Scripture, he ſhould lay it up in his heart to pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and meditate more upon it, to draw out the ſweetnes, and to experience the power of it. Thirdly, That vve may have it ready at hand for our uſe; and ſo the Scribe inſtructed for the kingdome of heaven is deſcribed by bringing forth out of his treaſury things both new and old. How ſad is the condition of many that have heard much, but laid up little or nothing at all of all that vvord which they have heard. Some having laid it up in their note books, are ſatisfied with that; 'tis good and uſefull to doe ſo; but doe not let it lye there, get a Copie of it in your hearts; a few truths in your hearts are better to you then many truths in your bookes; no man was ever ſaved by the vvord in his booke; unleſſe that vvord were alſo written in his heart. God commanded the <hi>Jewes</hi> (Deut. 6.8, 9.) to vvrite the law upon the <hi>poſt of their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and on their gates, to bind them as a ſigne upon their hand, and as frontlets between their eyes.</hi> They were commanded alſo to put fringes upon the borders of their garments (<hi>Numb.</hi> 15.38.) vvhich our Saviour calls <hi>Phylacteries</hi> (Math. 23.5.) theſe were ribands of blue ſilke, or as ſome ſay, ſcroles of parchment upon which the law being firſt wrought or written, and then bound up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their garments, <hi>they were to looke upon it, and remember all the commandements of the Lord</hi> (Num. 15.39.<note place="margin">Vaniſſimi pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecto phariſaei illi, qui cum ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi non ſervarent in corde manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap> Clothes, but none of it in their hearts. Thus the proud Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees went about as it were Clothed with the vvord of God, but his vvord was farre from their hearts, nor did it appeare in their lives; it is a meere vanity to have much of the law in our bookes, while vve neglect to keepe it in our hearts, and act it in our wayes. The former is good, but it doth no good without the latter. The want of this, the laying up the vvord in the heart, cauſeth the great want of Saints in the things of God; and as many looſe that Grace which they ſeemed to have, ſo many are at a loſſe in the uſe of that Grace which they have, becauſe they have not laid up the vvord of God in their hearts ſo carefully as they ought. We ſay prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bially, <hi>Sure bind and ſure find; They who would ſurely finde the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:153845:126"/> comfort of the word of God when they need it, had need to bind it ſure, when they receive it.</hi>

                  <p>To Returne is uſed frequently in Scripture in a metaphoricall ſenſe, and ſignifies as much as to repent; ſin is a going away from God, great ſinning is a going farre from God, a going, as it were, into a farre Country, ſuch ſinners would goe out of Gods ſight, and fall out of his memory. <hi>Eliphas</hi> had charged <hi>Job</hi> deeply with ſuch departures; and now he ſpeakes to him of returning.</p>
                  <p>And here wee may conſider the condition or ſtate of <hi>Job,</hi> and the ſeaſon in vvhich <hi>Eliphaz</hi> preſſeth him to this duty, he was in an afflicted condition, the hand of God was upon him. Novv <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> adviſeth him to returne; Intimating at leaſt, that the preſent diſpenſation of God towards him, vvas a ſpeciall opportunity for the duty he moved him unto.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <q>When God afflicts us, when his hand is upon us, he ſpeaks to us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, or beſpeaks our repentance.</q>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:153845:128"/>
                  <p>How often in Scripture doth the Lord complaine as if he were vvholy fruſtrated of his deſigne, vvhen either nations or perſons being ſmitten by his judgements did not returne unto him, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented not. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.13.) <hi>They turne not to him that ſmiteth them;</hi> that is, they turne not to me the Lord: I have ſmitten them, and I alone can heale them, <hi>yet they turne not to me;</hi> as if the Lord had ſaid, I therefore ſmote them that they might bethinke themſelves of returning, but they turned not to me. As they turned not at my vvord, or to me ſpeaking, ſo they turned not at my ſword, or to me ſmiting. I ſee they are not onely <hi>Sermon-proofe,</hi> my Prophets ſpake to them in vaine, but they are <hi>judgement-proofe</hi> alſo, my hand is upon them in vaine, they returne not. And as it was then, ſo at this day, for may vve not obſerve, ſome mouldering in their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, cruſhed in their hopes, croſſed in their children, blotted and blaſted in their credit, weake and ſicke in their bodies, even tired and vvorne out under ſeverall afflictions, yet no thought of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to the Lord, or of making their vvay perfect before him. So that the Lord may ſay to them, as he once did to his ancient people the <hi>Jewes</hi> (Iſa. 1.6.) <hi>Why ſhould ye be ſmitten any more, ye will revolt more and more.</hi> The returning of many is like that vvhich <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of (<hi>Pro.</hi> 26.11.) <hi>As a dog returneth to his vomit, ſo a foole returneth to his folly; As Jeſurun waxed fat, and kicked,</hi> ſo ſome vvill be kicking while they waxe leane.</p>
                  <p>Further, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> doth not ſpeake barely to <hi>Job</hi> of returning, but he directs him to the object; <hi>If thou returne</hi>

                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <p>That, <hi>True repentance is a full, a home returning to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Much of the progreſſe of a Chriſtian is to goe backward, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (I meane) from thoſe ſins and evills to which he hath (by temptation) been carried forth; nor (having ſinned) can any man goe forward till he returne to God. We reade in Scripture, of God returning to us, as well as of our returning unto God; in both there is repentance; when God returnes to us, he repents of the evill of puniſhment, that he hath brought upon us; and when we returne to God, we repent of the evill of ſin which we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt him: onely be ſure (as the points directs) that ye returne home to God. The Prophet found <hi>Iſraels</hi> repentance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in this (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.16.) <hi>They returne</hi> (that is, they make a ſhew of repentance) <hi>but not to the moſt high.</hi> There is a repentance which brings the ſoule never the neerer unto God. And that's a repentance (as we ſpeake) <hi>never the neere,</hi> or to no purpoſe. Thus another Prophet taxeth their faſting (<hi>Zech.</hi> 7.5.) <hi>When ye faſted and mourned in the fifth and ſeaventh month, even thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty yeares, did ye at all faſt unto me, even to me?</hi> Obſerve how he doubles it upon that poynt, as if the whole emphaſis of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance lay upon that poynt; <hi>To me, even to me.</hi> As <hi>David</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing his ſin (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4.) <hi>Againſt thee, thee, thee onely have I ſinned</hi> &amp;c. Many faſt, but not at all to God, they returne, but not at all to God. They faſt to themſelves, and returne to themſelves, that is, their own intereſt, not the honour of God is the motive and end of their faſting and repenting. And hence the Prophet is plaine and downeright with <hi>Iſrael</hi> in this caſe (<hi>Jer.</hi> 4.1.) <hi>If thou wilt returne, O Iſrael, ſaith the Lord, returne unto me;</hi> as if <hi>Iſrael</hi> had uſed to returne, but alwayes ſhort of God, or not to God, <hi>Iſrael</hi> made ſome ſtop in the worke of repentance before he came at God. Now then (ſaith the Lord by his Prophet) <hi>O Iſrael, if thou wilt returne, returne to me.</hi> If thou haſt any further purpoſe to returne, be perſwaded to returne to ſome purpoſe. Let not thy repentance be any longer ſuch as is to be repented of. All our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnings are but wanderings, unleſſe we returne to God.</p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:153845:129"/>
                  <p>But when may we be ſaid to returne to God?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer; firſt, when we returne out of a ſenſe of ſin againſt God, as well as of ſmart upon our ſelves; for when we returne only becauſe of ſmart, we returne to our ſelves rather then to God; as when it is ſaid in <hi>Hoſea</hi> (Chap. 7.16.) <hi>They returned, but not to the moſt high;</hi> we may ſee the reaſon of this charge at the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe; <hi>They have not cryed unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they aſſemble themſelves for corne and for wine, and they rebel againſt me.</hi> As if he had ſaid, all their crying and howling, is not becauſe they have ſinned againſt me, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their ſins have pincht them, they doe not mourne becauſe of their wickednes, but becauſe of their wants. 'Tis famine that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them, not my feare. They would faine be at their full tables againe, they are all for corne and wine, nothing for grace and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. We may ſay of ſome perſons repenting, as <hi>Job</hi> (Chap. 6.6.) of the wild Aſſe braying, <hi>Doth the wild Aſſe bray when he hath graſſe, or loweth the Ox over his fodder;</hi> he applyed it to his owne caſe, that he did not cry out without cauſe, he was, nor complaine when he felt no paine; but (I ſay) we may apply it to ſome perſons repenting. <hi>They would never bray if they had but graſſe enough, nor low if they had foddar enough;</hi> that is, if they had but outward comfort enough, corne and wine, health and ſtrength enough, did they but abound in theſe, you ſhould never heare them complaine nor ſhed a teare, how much ſoever they abound in ſin; All the vvorld cannot ſatisfie the ſoule of a godly man, till (after ſinning) he be reconciled to God; His ſoule is hungry and thirſty, notwithſtanding all his corne and wine, till he be filled with the favour of God. And, this is indeed <hi>to returne to the Allmighty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Then alſo we returne to the Almighty, when vve turne ſpecially from and mourne for that ſinne whereby vve have moſt provoked the Allmighty; when that which hath moſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded God, is moſt offenſive and burdenſome unto us. For though in repentance, every ſin is to be repented of, yet ſome more; As <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid to the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (1 Sam. 7.3.) <hi>if you doe returne to the Lord with all your hearts, then put away the ſtrange Gods and Aſtaroth.</hi> But why doth he exhort them to put away that ſtrange God <hi>Aſtaroth,</hi> by name, more then any other of their ſtrange gods? I anſwer; it was becauſe they had moſt provoked the true God by worſhipping that ſtrange God, and therefore he counſels
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:153845:130"/> them as ever they would approve themſelves to have returned to God in their repentance, to looke to it, that they turned from <hi>that Idol.</hi> If every ſtrange God muſt be put away when we returne to God, how can we returne to God, if we put not away <hi>our Aſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roth.</hi> Thus the rule was given by the king of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> in proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a faſt (<hi>Jon.</hi> 3.8.) <hi>Let them turne every one from his evill way</hi> (that is, from his beloved ſin) <hi>and from the violence that is in their hands,</hi> that is, from the ſin of oppreſſion, by which they got much into their hands. But why doth he inſtance in that ſinne? Surely becauſe that was the common ſin of that City, they were an oppreſſing people, and loved the gaine of oppreſſion, or to get by violence; They lived more by the bloud of others, then by their owne ſweate, more by the violence, then the labour of their hands, therefore they muſt particularly repent of that ſinne. If the covetous man returne to God, he muſt turne from every ſinne, and from his covetouſneſſe. If the proud man returne to God, he muſt turne from every ſinne, and from his pride, this is the nature of returning to the Allmighty, yet</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Unleſſe we doe all this with the whole heart, we doe not returne to the Allmighty (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.38.) <hi>Jere.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Jere.</hi> 24.7. The wicked are ſerious and cordiall in ſinning, they muſt be ſo in repenting. But ſome ſinner poſſibly may ſay, I have gone away too farre to returne; No, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Thou haſt played the harlot with many lovers, yet returne unto me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Another will ſay, I have ſliden back and relapſed, I have as it were, repented of my repentance. The Prophet anſwers this doubt (<hi>Jer.</hi> 3.12.) <hi>Returne thou back-ſliding Iſrael, ſaith the Lord.</hi> And againe (<hi>v.</hi> 14.) <hi>Turne O back-ſliding children, ſaith the Lord, for I marryed unto you</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If thou returne</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> having thus ſhewed him that it is his duty to <hi>returne to the Allmighty,</hi> now proceeds to ſhew that it will be his happines, and this he doth by an enumeration of thoſe manifold bleſſings which follow our returning to him. Whereof the firſt is,
<q>Thou ſhalt be built up.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Affliction and trouble, which are the fruit of ſin, pull downe, and lay us waſt, godly ſorrow and repentance, which are our turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from ſin, have a promiſe of this good fruit, <hi>That we ſhall be built up againe.</hi>

                  <p>This building up, may be taken two wayes; firſt, more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally for an encreaſe in all good things; ſecondly, more ſpecially for an encreaſe in children. In the Hebrew the ſame word,<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>If we by repentance pull downe the ſtrong holds of ſinne, if we forſake and lay waſt our luſts, the Lord will build us up, he will build us up with all manner of bleſſings; repentance is fruitfull; There are many who profeſſe they repent, but they doe not bring forth fruits meete for repentance; but as true repentance is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with our fruits of holines and obedience towards God, ſo with Gods fruits, the fruits of his love and mercy towards us.

If we as the Baptiſt exhorted the <hi>Jewes (Math.</hi> 3.) <hi>Bring forth fruit meete for repentance,</hi> our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance will bring forth fruit meete for us; we ſhall have good things of all ſorts, if we ſorrow (as the Apoſtle ſaith the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> did) after a godly ſort; godly ſorrow is rewarded with joy; if we humble our ſelves, God will lift us up. The ſorrows of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel repentance, are like the ſorrows of a woman in travaile, who (as Chriſt ſpeakes <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.21.) <hi>ſtraight way forgets her paine for joy that a man is borne into the world.</hi> The pangs and throws of godly ſorrow are therefore ſayd by the Apoſtle to cauſe repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance not to be repented of, becauſe that repentance brings forth joy to be rejoyced in, a maſculine joy, joy that a man-childe of Grace to build up our ſpirituall houſe is brought into the world. <hi>If thou returne to the Allmighty, thou ſhalt be build up.</hi> And

                  <p>We returne not at all to the Allmighty, till we wholy turne from ſinne, nor will the Allmighty build up our houſe, till we put iniquity quite out of our houſe; till we turne it out of houſe and home; out of the houſe of our family, out of the home of our hearts; nor is it enough to put ſinne away a little, or a little way, but it muſt be put farre away. There are ſeverall degrees of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away ſin; firſt, There is a putting it away out of our practice, or converſation, ſo that it hath no viſible being or abode in us or with us. This is a putting of ſin away, but this is not a putting of ſin farre away. Secondly, There is a putting of it out of our affections, or out of our hearts; not as if we could keepe it (while we are in the body) from having a place or dwelling there, but as keeping it from having a throane or reigning there. This is to put ſin very farre away from us; it is no great thing to put ſinne out of our hands, but 'tis hard to get it out of our hearts; hypocrites will (poſſibly) lay downe the practice of it, but ſtill their ſpirits cleave to it, they are not at all alienated from the love of it, but onely reſtrained from the acting of it; ſuch are oftentimes kept from doing iniquity, but they do not at all put away their iniquity, much leſſe put it far away. As it is with a naturall man in reference to his doing of Good, ſo to his not doing of evill; If good be at
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:153845:132"/> any time in his practice, yet it is farre from his ſpirit, he hath no minde to it, he cannot ſay the law of God is in his heart, or that he delights to doe it; ſo if evill be at any time put out of his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, yet it is ſtill in his ſpirit, his minde is toward it, he cannot ſay that his heart is withdrawne from it, or that he hates it. No, but as the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeakes of the ſtubborne <hi>Jewes</hi> (Ezek. 11.21.) <hi>Their heart walketh after the heart of their deteſtable things.</hi> As every Godly man is (in the maine) like <hi>David,</hi> A man after Gods owne heart, and walketh after the heart of God; ſo every ungodly man is a man after the heart of the devill, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Idolater or worſhipper of falſe Gods (who is one of the worſt of ungodly men) is after the heart of his falſe gods, and he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after the heart of his falſe Gods, which the Prophet calls <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable things.</hi> Whatſoever is moſt after the heart or according to the deſires and commands of an Idol, that the Idolatrous heart walketh after; that is, he loves it, he delights in it, and thus doth every naturall mans heart walke after the heart of his luſt, though ſometime his feete walke not after it, or he may ſeeme to lay it out of his hand. But he that turnes indeed from ſin, deales with it, when he is repenting of it, as the Lord doth when he is pardoning it. How is that? The Lord in pardoning ſin, puts it farre from us (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.12.) <hi>As farre as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, ſo farre hath he removed our tranſgreſſions from us;</hi> That is, he hath remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them from us to the utmoſt imaginable diſtance; for ſuch is that of the Eaſt from the Weſt: they and we ſhall no more meete together againe, then the Eaſt and Weſt ſhall or can meete at all. And thus in repenting a godly man deſires to put his ſin as farre from him as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, that he and they may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meete together in the practice of them, as he is aſſured that God hath ſo pardoned them that they and he ſhall never meete together in the puniſhment of them.</p>

And this ſurely was it which provoked the Lord to cruſh thy family of children and their ſervants with the fall of a houſe; now therefore I counſel thee to put away iniquity from thy tabernacle, that is, from all that belong to thee, from all that are under thy ſhadow, and are committed to thy truſt and charge.</hi>

                  <p>They ſhould cleanſe not their perſons onely, but their families, they ſhould ſweep their houſes, as well as their hearts from ſin. (<hi>Gen.</hi> 35.2.) <hi>Then Jacob ſaid to his houſehold, and to all that were with him, put away the ſtrange Gods</hi> (or, the <hi>eſtranging Gods</hi> (ſuch are Idols, they are not onely <hi>ſtrange,</hi> becauſe new Gods, and <hi>ſtrange,</hi> becauſe 'tis a ſtrange or wonderfull thing that man ſhould be ſo beſotted as to worſhip ſuch things for Gods, but they are eſtranging Gods) becauſe they withdraw or ſteale away the heart from the true God; therefore ſayd <hi>Jacob put away the ſtrange Gods) that are among you, and be cleane, and change your garments.</hi> This outward changing of their garments ſignified the changing or cleanſing of their ſoules. God principally lookes at that, and the outward ceremony hath no acceptance at all without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſincerity; In compariſon of which, as the Lord ſaid in <hi>Joel, Rent your hearts, and not your garments,</hi> ſo he would ſay here, <hi>change your hearts, and not your Garments.</hi> Now <hi>Jacob</hi> was very carefull, that this bleſſed <hi>change of Garments,</hi> betokening the change and cleanſing both of heart and life, ſhould be the livery of all his family and houſehold. Family ſinnes bring family judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as well as perſonall: and they that have the charge of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, have (in a great degree) a charge of ſoules as well as of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; every Maſter of a family hath <hi>cure of ſoules;</hi> And he is to ſee ſo farre as lieth in him, that no ſinne nor wickedneſſe remaine or be harboured in his family, that his children and ſervants live not in ignorance, nor in any evill. In the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Numbers, Moſes</hi> gives charge to the Congregation, <hi>That they ſhould depart from the tents of thoſe wicked men, Corah, Dathan, and Abiram;</hi> it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to be neere the families of the wicked, but it is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to have wickedneſſe remaining in our family, in our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:153845:133"/> or in our children. And if Maſters endeavour not by all due meanes, to remove ſin out of their family, that in a little time may remove them out of their family, or (as we ſay) eate them out of houſe and home. <hi>Thou ſhalt put away iniquity farre from thy Tabernacle.</hi> Thus much of this part of the verſe, in the firſt ſence, as <hi>iniquity</hi> is taken for ſin; yet,</p>
                  <p>Further, as the word <hi>iniquity</hi> is taken for <hi>puniſhment, thou ſhalt put away iniquity</hi> (or the effects of iniquity) <hi>farre from thy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle;</hi> and then the words are both a new promiſe and a further explication of what is meant by being <hi>built up,</hi> which was the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer promiſe; <hi>Thou ſhalt be built up, and all evill ſhall depart away from thy Tabernacle. Iniquity,</hi> which properly ſignifies the evill of ſin, is often put in Scripture, for the evills of trouble and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and as all acknowledge this to be a truth, ſo ſome judge it the truth ſpecially intended in this place. I ſhall therefore briefely, note from it,
<q>
                        <hi>That,</hi> when we truely returne to God from ſin, then ſuffering evills depart from us and ours.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For though the Lord be pleaſed to diſpence variouſly for triall of his people, and often ſuffers the evill of affliction to hang about their Tabernacles, who deſire ſincerely, and endeavour faithfully to <hi>put all iniquity farre from their Tabernacles,</hi> yet this is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God, and this hath been often experienced by Godly men; That God hath turned trouble out of their doores, when they have humbly and zealouſly laboured to turne ſin out of their hearts.</p>

                  <p>There are many in the world who have gold, but there are few who have this defence for it. The Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> ſpeakes of thoſe who earned money, but put it <hi>into a bag with holes;</hi> that is, they could not hold or keepe what they had gotten. It is the Lord that eſtabliſheth the creature to us, and defends it for us.

Some mens eſtates waſt away they know not how, there is a hole in the bottome of the bagge they thought not of. Others have their eſtates violently taken away from them, becauſe the Lord is not their defence. The Lord is The protector of his people, the Lord is a Caſtle, a ſtrong Tower, all manner of fortifications about his people, to defend their eſtates and perſons, much more their ſoules.

Know, that as the Lord makes his wayes ſweet to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by inward communications of himſelfe, revealing his love and grace to them, yea in them, ſo he makes his wayes ſweete to his people by giving them outward good things, bleſſing their basket and their ſtore, filling their hearts with food and gladnes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>
                        <hi>That,</hi> The godly man may lawfully poſſeſſe earthly riches, gold and ſilver.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is no ſin to be rich, but when riches are got by ſin; Poore <hi>Lazarus</hi> lay in the boſome of rich <hi>Abraham;</hi> As many poore men may be called the Devills poore, ſo ſome that are rich may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Gods rich men. Againe, if Godlines have a promiſe (as it hath) of riches, then the godly may lawfully poſſeſſe riches; which alſo may be inſtruments in their hands of glorifying God, and doing good among men. Nor can it be denyed, that they know beſt how to uſe the things of the world, and how to be the beſt Stewards of earthly treaſures, who are inſtructed for the kingdome of heaven, and are (as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts Saints to be (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10.) <hi>Good Stewards of the manifold grace of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note;
<q>That riches, gold and ſilver are at Gods diſpoſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He beſtows them where, and upon whom he pleaſeth. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of plenty of gold, upon repentance and returning to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, muſt needs proceed from this ſuppoſition, that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty hath gold and ſilver in his power. <hi>The world is the Lords, and the fullnes of it</hi> (Pſal. 50.12.) <hi>God is the beſt Indies for gold.</hi> If any would trade for gold proſperouſly, let them trade heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; for God is every where Lord of the ſoyle, and he ſaith of all the pretious <hi>mines</hi> hidden in the bowels of the earth, They are <hi>mine.</hi> See how the Lord ſpeaks as the great proprietour of all the gold, and ſilver, of all the good things of this world; (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.8, 9.) <hi>Shee did not know that I gave her corne, and wine, and oyle, and multiplyed her ſilver and gold, which they prepared for Baal, therefore I will returne, and take away my corne in the time thereof, and my wine in the ſeaſon thereof, and will recover my wool and my
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:153845:138"/> flaxe</hi> &amp;c. <hi>All's mine.</hi> Thus the Lord voucheth himſelfe the great owner of all theſe things, all the gold &amp; ſilver, all the wool and the flaxe, all the corne and wine are his. When the people and Princes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with <hi>David</hi> their king offered ſo willingly and ſo liberally Gold and ſilver &amp;c. for the building of the Temple. <hi>David</hi> makes this confeſſion for them all (1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 29.14.) <hi>All things come of thee, and of thine owne have we given thee.</hi> And may he not doe what he will with his owne? Men thinke they may, ſurely God both may and will.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Obſerve;
<q>
                        <hi>That,</hi> the plenty and ſtability of the creature, is from God as well as the poſſeſſion of it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eliphaz</hi> promiſeth <hi>Job</hi> from the Lord <hi>gold as the duſt, and as the ſtones of the brooke, with ſilver of ſtrength,</hi> that we have it in ſuch or ſuch a proportion is from the Lord, as much as that we have any thing at all; he can give much as well as little, &amp; that our proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath a defence and ſtrength in it is from the Lord; therefore we ſhould honour the Almighty for every portion and proportion of worldly riches, and for the eſtabliſhment of our portion whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it is. Silver and gold have no ſtrength in them unleſſe the Lord who giveth theſe give them ſtrength, and bid them ſtay with us to doe us good. Laſtly, Obſerve;
<q>We may lawfully poſſeſſe abundance of outward things.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis ſinfull to make abundance our aime, or to contend for much in temporals; to doe ſo in and about ſpiritualls is our duty, and our contention for the higheſt degree our commendation. We ſhould deſigne it, to lay up the Gold of Grace, as the duſt, and the ſilver of ſanctification as the ſtones of the brooke; We ſhould forget all that we have, that we might get what we have not. Our deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings while pitcht upon an eternall object cannot be immoderate, but in temperals they quickly may: and therefore as to them, our moderation ſhould be known to all men. Yet if God give in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of temporals in the lawfull exerciſe of our callings, we may warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tably enjoy it as a bleſſing from him. The providence of God doth often bound us to a little, and we ought to be contented with the leaſt portion of outward things, with bare food &amp; rayment; but the word of God doth not bound us to a little, nor doth it ſay it is
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:153845:138"/> unlawfull to have much. And as it is not unlawfull to have much of the world, ſo it is a great exerciſe and tryall of our Graces to have much; As there are ſome Graces of a Chriſtian which come not to tryall till we are in want, ſo there are other Graces which come not to tryall unleſſe we have aboundance. Want tryeth our pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and our dependance upon God for a ſupply of what we have not; and aboundance tryeth our temperance, our humility, our liberality, yea and our dependance upon and faith in God, for the ſanctifying, bleſſing, and making of that comfortable to us which we have. When a rich man ſeeth an emptines in his aboundance without the enjoyments of God in it, he exerciſeth as high a grace, and ſheweth as heavenly a frame of mind, as that poore man doth who ſeeth and enjoyeth a fullnes in God, in the midſt of all his emptines. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> puts both theſe alike upon a divine teaching, (<hi>Phil.</hi> 4.12.) <hi>In all things I am inſtructed, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to ſuffer need.</hi> And had it been unlawfull to enjoy plenty, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had never preſſed <hi>Job</hi> to repentance by this motive, <hi>The Almighty ſhall be thy defence, and thou ſhalt have plenty of ſilver.</hi>

                  <p>As if <hi>Eliphas</hi> had ſaid; <hi>If thou doſt indeed repent and turne from ſin, thy conſcience which now troubles, yea torments thee, ſhall have ſweete peace in God, and thou who now grovelleſt with thy eyes downe to the ground, by reaſon of thy preſſing guilt, and miſery, ſhalt then with confidence lift up thy face unto God in prayer, and thou ſhalt finde God ſo ready at hand with an anſwer, that thou ſhalt ſee cauſe chearefully to performe thy Vowes, which thou madeſt to him in the day of trouble;</hi> That's the generall ſcope of this latter part of the Chapter.

                  <q>For then ſhalt thou have thy delight in the Allmighty.</q>
                  <p>The firſt word implyeth a reaſon of what he had ſaid before.

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:153845:139"/> comforts, even delight in himſelfe.</hi> 'Tis an argument like that of the Apoſtle (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32.) <hi>He that ſpared not his owne Sonne but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him freely give us all things?</hi> Thus <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſeemes to argue, ſeeing God will give thee himſelfe to rejoyce in, or to rejoyce in himſelfe, how can he deny thee gold and ſilver with thoſe other conveniencies which concerne this life? theſe being indeed as <hi>nothing</hi> in compariſon of <hi>himſelfe.</hi>

                  <q>Then ſhalt thou delight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

The word is uſed againe (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.13, 14.) where the Prophet ſpeaks of keeping the Sabboth; <hi>If thou turne away thy foote from the Sabbath from doing thy pleaſure on my holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight;</hi> what then? <hi>then ſhalt thou delight thy ſelfe in the Lord;</hi> thou ſhalt have curious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, all manner of delight in the Lord, <hi>if thou call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable, and ſhalt honour him;</hi> if thou haſt a delight in duty, thou ſhalt have the delight of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Eliphaz, then ſhalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty.</hi> And 'tis conſiderable that he doth not ſay, thou ſhalt have thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the mercifull, or gracious God, but in the Allmighty; in him thou ſhalt have thy delight, whoſe power is over all, and who
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:153845:140"/> is able to doe whatſoever pleaſeth him. Even the power and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightineſſe of the Lord ſhall be as pleaſant to thee as his mercy and loving kindneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Further, <hi>delight</hi> in the generall nature of it, conſiſts in theſe two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In the ſuitableneſſe and conveniency of the object, and the faculty, whether ſenſitive or intellective.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It conſiſts in the reflection and application of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty upon the object. So that to delight our ſelves in the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, hath theſe two things in it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A ſuitableneſſe in our ſoules to the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The ſoules reflecting upon the Lord as good and gratious unto us. This reflect act breeds and brings in delight, and works the heart to an unſpeakeable joy in God. By this laſt and higheſt act of faith, we take in the ſweetneſſe of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and delight our ſelves in him mightily. This faith doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuck the promiſes, wherein the love of God is evidenced to us, but is it ſelfe an evidence of the love of God to us. <hi>We ſucke and are ſatisfied with the breaſts of conſolation</hi> by beleeving (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.11.) that is, we beleeving draw forth that ſweetneſſe of the promiſe which the word declares to be the portion of Beleevers. Thus ſpirituall delight is made up; and therefore Saints are ſayd <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in beleeving, with joy unſpeakeable and full of glory</hi> (1 Pet. 1.8.) that is, having as much and as cleare a manifeſtation, yea parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation and taſt of that Glory in beleeving, which is prepared and reſerved for them againſt the next life, as they are capable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and more then they are able to expreſs, in this life. <hi>Then ſhalt thou delight thy ſelfe in the Allmighty,</hi> We may looke upon the words firſt as a command; and then obſerve,

That ſoule cannot delight in the Almighty, who loveth and continueth in the love of ſinne. If ſuch profeſſe delight in God, it is but a falſe boaſt, and a high preſumption; it is impoſſible for ſuch to delight in the Lord indeed. <hi>Job</hi> (Chap. 27.10.) ſaith of the hypocrite; <hi>Will he delight himſelfe in the Allmighty? will he alwayes call upon God?</hi> He may pretend to a delight in the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, he may have ſome flaſhes, ſome raptures, but his joyes and delights are not in the Allmighty, what joyes ſoever he hath they are in ſomewhat below God; the hypocrite may delight him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in ſomewhat received from the Almighty, in ſome preſent benefit, or future expectation that he hath from the Almighty; he cannot delight in the Allmighty himſelfe, or in God as God.</p>
                  <p>As it is impoſſible in the nature of the thing, for a man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſin, and in God too; ſo God hath ſayd that he who hath a delight in ſin, ſhall not finde any delight in him. God hath ſayd, <hi>Delight thy ſelfe in me, and I will give thee the deſires of thy heart, (Pſal.</hi> 37.4.) But if any man will follow the deſires of his owne heart, he ſhall not delight himſelfe in God. <hi>Sinne ſeparateth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us</hi> (Iſa. 59.2.) that is, it ſeparates between the comforts and mercies which are in God, and us; ſin doth not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſeparate us from the power, or preſence, from the eye, or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, ſo ſinne doth not ſeparate (for God is nigh to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners both to ſee what they are doing, and to puniſh them for what they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ve done ſinfully) but ſin ſeparates from all thoſe delights that flow from God, from thoſe joyes which his people take in him; yea ſin breeds a ſtrangeneſſe between God and the ſoule, ſo that the ſoule that loveth ſinne, cannot have any holy famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity or converſe with God. The Lord ſaith to thoſe who repent
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:153845:141"/> (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.18.) <hi>Come let us reaſon together,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſayd, I am now ready to debate the matter with you that repent, and how great ſoever your ſinnes have been, they ſhall be blotted out. Whereas before the Lord tells them that he was weary of them, and that they were a burthen to him in all their ſervices; Now when we are a burthen to God, God is never pleaſant to us; if the Lord ſay he is weary of us, we cannot ſay we delight our ſelves in him. Our delight and pleaſure in God is the fruit of his delight in and wel-pleaſednes with us.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> propoſeth this delight in the Lord, as the moſt winning promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>Delight in the Lord is the higheſt and choiceſt mercy.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is nothing better, nothing ſweeter then to delight in the Lord; delight in the Lord hath all true delights in it. <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes this out fully in that place lately quoted to another occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.4.) <hi>Delight thy ſelfe in the Lord, and he ſhall give thee the deſires of thy heart;</hi> that is, thou ſhalt have all thy deſires fullfilled in this thing; delight in the Lord will be the fullfilling of all thy deſires; not only ſhall they who delight themſelves in the Lord; have all their deſires filled up, but their very delight in the Lord is the fullfilling of all their deſires. What is the glory of heaven, but delighting in the Lord? And he who delights in the Lord, feeles not the want or abſence of any earthly Good. <hi>In thy preſence is fullneſſe of joy, and at thy right hand are pleaſures for evermore</hi> (Pſal. 16 11.) Heavenly glory is nothing but delight in God, and all earthly good is nothing without delight in God. We may affirme foure things of this delight, in oppoſition to all worldly delights.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, This is a reall delight, worldly delights are but ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, or pageant-like ſhewes of delight. The joyes of a hypocrite, are like his holines, meere appearances of joy; he hath no reall, no true joy, as he hath no true, no reall holineſſe. That man doth but faine a taſte of joy, whoſoever he is, that doth but faine the practice of holineſſe. Thus who wickedly hold out a holines which they feele not, ſhall talke of joyes which they finde not.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Delight in the Lord is a ſtrong delight, yea it is a ſtrengthening delight; That muſt needs be ſtrong joy, which is
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:153845:142"/> ſtrengthening joy; ſuch is the joy of the Lord, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> told that people (<hi>Neh:</hi> 8.10.) <hi>The joy of the Lord, is the ſtrength of the ſoule, the ſtrength of the inward man, it makes us mighty, it makes us giants to run our race, the race of holineſſe.</hi> The giant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth to run his race, becauſe he is ſtrong, and knowes he can doe it. The joy of the Lord is our ſtrength, and is both an evidence tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> wee are ſtrong, and a meanes to make us ſo. Worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights are weake, and they weaken us, Delight in the Lord is ſtrong, and it ſtrengthens.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is a laſting delight; not like the <hi>crackling of thornes under a pott,</hi> (to which <hi>Solomon</hi> elegantly compares the <hi>laughter of the foole,</hi> Eccl. 7.6.) that make a noiſe, and a blaze for a while, but are preſently extinct. Now <hi>Solomons</hi> foole may be eyther, firſt, the prophane man in the world, or, ſecondly, the hypocrite in the Church; All the joyes of this payre of fooles, the prophane worldling, and the formal hypocrite are ſoone in and ſoone out, like crackling thornes. But joy or delight in the Almighty is a laſting delight, it is not for a fitt, or a pang, but for continuance, yea it continueth in the middeſt of all worldly ſorrows, for it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes and conquers them. There is a laughter in which (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Pro. 14.13.) the heart is ſorrowfull, and there is a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ow in which the heart laughs; <hi>As ſorrowfull, yet alwayes rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10.) Spiritual joy, or joy in the Lord is not extinguiſhed, though ſurrounded with worldly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes; <hi>Many waters cannot quench this vehement flame, this flame of God</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes of love, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.) <hi>neyther can the floods drowne it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Delight in the Allmighty is a holy delight, a delight which makes us more holy; the delights of the world are impure, and they defile us, we ſeldome take in worldly pleaſures, but they leave ſome ſpot and taint upon our ſpirits or converſations; but the delights we have in the Lord are all pure, yea purifying delights, they make the ſoule more cleare, more holy, more heavenly, they make us like unto the Almighty, in whom our delight is. For look what the object is in which we delight, ſuch is the ſpirit of him that takes that delight; now the Lord in whom this delight is, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together holy, they that take delight in him, muſt needs be made or kept holy by it. As delight in worldly things makes the heart worldly, baſe and dreggiſh, ſo this refines and purifies it. The more
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:153845:142"/> we drinke of the rivers of this pleaſure, the more ſober we are, <hi>to be an epicure</hi> (as it were) <hi>in theſe delights,</hi> is the higheſt tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Our feeding cannot be too full, nor our drafts too large upon theſe delights. <hi>Solomon</hi> (Eccle. 2.2.) who had run a courſe through all worldly delights, and tryed them to the utmoſt, ſaid <hi>of laughter it is mad, and of mirth what doth it?</hi> there is a madneſſe in the mirth of the world, what doth it? that is, what good doth it to any man? many things it doth, it makes men vaine, fooliſh, diſſolute, diſpirited for any goodneſſe; but what good doth it? doth it make any man better, more holy, more wiſe or fit for du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, no, it can doe none of theſe things. But delight in the Lord, is all this, and can doe all this, it is true, ſtrong, ſtrengthening,<note place="margin">Quum unus quiſq, licenter reſpicit id, in quo delectatur, ſubd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> laſting, holy, a delight that makes us more holy. This is the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints at all times, though payd them in more or ſpecially at ſome times, and that eyther, firſt, reſpecting the ſtate and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of their owne ſoules, as in the reſt, or ſecondly, the ſtate of and promiſed diſpenſations of God to the Church.

Therefore <hi>Eliphaz</hi> addeth,
<q>And ſhalt lift up thy face to God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſome may ſay, is that ſuch a great matter, is it any ſpeciall favour to lift up the face to God? ſeing to doe ſo is common to mankinde. The Naturaliſt ſaith,<note place="margin">O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Eliphaz</hi> meanes not the lifting up of a heart-leſſe face or head, ſuch as the hypocrite or formaliſt lifts up to God in worſhip, nor the lifting up of a meere living head or face, ſuch as all men lift up to God according to the forme or frame of their

                     </note> but the courage and confidence of the ſoule, and that a holy courage and confidence, is here intended. And there are not many, who can thus lift up their face to God, as is promiſed here to <hi>Job</hi> by way of priviledge.</p>

                  <p>

                  <p>The Septuagint who rather paraphraſe then tranſlate this text, give this ſenſe fully; <hi>Thou ſhalt be confident before the Lord (or thou ſhalt act fiducially and boldly before him) and behold heaven chearefully.</hi> This lifting up the face is oppoſed to caſting downe the face, &amp; that is a phraſe uſed in Scripture to ſignifie ſhame and fayling of ſpirit. When courage is downe, the countenance is down too; as we ſay, ſuch a man <hi>hath a downe looke,</hi> that is, there is an appearance of guilt upon him. The face is caſt downe three wayes; Firſt, by feare; ſecondly, by ſorrow; thirdly, by ſhame. <hi>Ezra.</hi> 9.6. <hi>O my God I am aſhamed and bluſh, to lift up my face unto thee; for our iniquities are increaſed over our heads.</hi> So (<hi>Luk.</hi> 18.13.) the <hi>Publican durſt not lift up his eyes to heaven,</hi> and poſſibly there was a complication of all theſe three cauſes why he durſt not, feare, ſorrow, ſhame; he was ſo much terrified, ſo much grieved, ſo much aſhamed of himſelfe, that he durſt not lift up his eyes to heaven. It was the ſpeech of <hi>Abner</hi> to <hi>Aſahel</hi> (2 Sam. 2.22.) <hi>Turne thee aſide from following me, why ſhould I ſmite thee to the ground, how then ſhould I hold up my face to Joab thy brother;</hi> that is, if I ſlay thee I ſhall be afraid to looke him in the face, nor can I have any confidence of his favour; and it is well conceived, that he ſpake thus (for it is indeed a very unuſuall thing for the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of an Army in the very heate of warre to looke after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Generall of the oppoſite Army, but (I ſay) 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:153845:143"/> he ſpake thus) as being convinced that he had undertaken a bad cauſe in upholding the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> againſt <hi>David,</hi> and therefore had miſgivings that he might ſhortly fall into the hands of <hi>Joab Davids</hi> Generall, and was therefore unwilling to provoke him by killing his brother. This made him ſay, <hi>How ſhall I hold up my face to thy brother Joab?</hi> As if he had ſayd, I ſhall obſtruct the way of my owne reconciliation to thy brother, (in caſe The turne of things in this warre caſt me into his hands) by killing thee. Againe we may looke backe to <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.5. where it is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of <hi>Caine,</hi> That he was wrath, <hi>and his countenance fell;</hi> anger, and ſorrow, and ſhame, falling at once upon him (becauſe the Lord had reſpect to <hi>Abel</hi> and his offering, but had no reſpect to him or his) cauſed his countenance to fall; which phraſe ſtands in direct oppoſition to lifting up the face in all the three occaſions of it. For it implyeth firſt feare, which is oppoſed to boldnes; ſecondly, ſorrow or anger, which are oppoſed to content and joy; thirdly, ſhame which is oppoſed both to freedome of approach, and liberty of ſpeech.

                  <p>Hence obſerve;
<q>Holineſſe hath boldneſſe and freedome of ſpirit with God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then ſhalt thou lift up thy face unto God.</hi> As ſoone as <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, he hid himſelfe from the preſence of the Lord amongſt the trees of the Garden, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.8.) He ran into the thickets for ſhelter, he durſt not appeare or ſhew his face. But when once we are reconciled to God, and ſinne is taken off, when we are freed from the bonds of guilt, then we have boldneſſe, reconciliation is accompanied with the ſpirit of adoption, <hi>whereby we cry abba fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> we can then ſpeake to God as a childe to his father; the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:153845:144"/> childe dares lift up his face to his father, and ſpeakes freely to him. <hi>Where the ſpirit of the Lord is, there is liberty</hi> (faith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17.) and that a threefold liberty. Firſt, a liberty from ſinne; ſecondly, a liberty unto righteouſnes, or a freenes and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines of ſpirit to doe good; thirdly, where the ſpirit of the Lord is, there is a liberty of ſpeech or acceſſe, with boldneſſe in all our holy Addreſſes unto God.

He I ſay, was better inſtructed then ſo, and therefore though he (doubtleſſe) did fully beleeve that God would fullfill the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> in giving him a ſonne, yet <hi>he entreated the Lord for his wife becauſe ſhe was barren:</hi> and <hi>he intreated the Lord ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly,</hi> he made plenty, abundance of prayers; for it cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed but that he had prayed for that mercy long before (for it was neere twenty yeares ſince his marriage to <hi>Rebeccah,</hi> as appeares plainely by comparing the 20 verſe of that Chapter with the 26<hi rend="sup">•h</hi>, the former telling us, that he was forty yeares old when he marryed <hi>Rebeccah,</hi> and the latter that he was threeſcore when <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beccah</hi> bare <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau.</hi> So that I ſay, we cannot ſuppoſe but ſo holy a man as <hi>Iſack</hi> had been ſuing out the good of the promiſe before) but when he perceived it ſticking ſo long in the birth, then his ſoule fell in travel about it, then he was very fervent in prayer, and would give the Lord no reſt; <hi>Then he entreated the Lord</hi> &amp;c. The ſame is ſayd of <hi>Manoah</hi> (Judges 13.8.) <hi>Then Manoah in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the Lord, and ſaid, oh my Lord, let the man of God which thou didſt ſend come againe unto us, and teach us what we ſhould doe unto the childe that ſhall be borne;</hi> he prayed then with much earneſtnes, or made prayers for direction in that thing. The word is often uſed to ſignifie abundance, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.2.) <hi>It ſhall bloſſome abundantly. (Jere.</hi> 33.6.) <hi>Behold, I will bring in health, and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveale unto them the abundance of peace, and truth.</hi> Not onely ſhall they have peace, and truth, but abundance of them.

                  <p>We owe prayer to God as his creatures, or in regard of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall dependance upon him, much more as new creatures, or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our ſpirituall dependance upon him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>It is our duty not onely to pray, but to pray much, or to pray with much fervency.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The emphaſis of the Originall word here uſed, leades us to this as well as many Scripture Authorities. Cold asking invites a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall, 'tis effectuall or working fervent prayer that prevailes much, (<hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16.)</p>
                  <p>Note, thirdly.</p>
                  <q>Prayer is due onely to God.</q>
                  <p>Prayer is a part of holy worſhip, and all ſuch worſhip is proper to God alone; <hi>Thou ſhalt make thy prayer unto him.</hi> Saints and Angels worſhip God with us; we muſt not worſhip eyther Saint or Angel with God, no nor God by the helpe and mediation of Saints or Angels. We know no mediator of interceſſion, but he who is the mediator of redemption, the Lord Jeſur Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Taking in the conſideration of the time, as before in the former part; <hi>Then ſhalt thou have thy delight in the Lord, then ſhalt thou make thy prayer to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>That,</hi> we are never in a fit frame for prayer, till wee turne from every ſin by repentance.</q>
                  <p>As the Lord will not heare us when we pray, <hi>if we regard ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in our heart</hi> (Pſal. 68.18.) ſo neyther are we in a fitnes to ſpeake to God in prayer, if we regard any iniquity in our hearts. Repenting and praying muſt be of the ſame length; unleſſe we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent continually, we cannot pray continually, becauſe we ſin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually. <hi>The more holy we are, the more free we are to pray.</hi> Sinne clogs and checks the ſpirit in this great duty, caſt off that weight, and <hi>then, ſhalt thou make thy prayer to him,</hi>
                     <q>And he ſhall heare thee.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To heare prayer, is more then to take notice of the matter or words ſpoken; to heare prayer, is to grant what we pray for; as
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:153845:145"/> our hearing the word of God is more then to take in the ſound or ſence of what is ſpoken; it is to ſubmit to and obey what is ſpoken; Now as we heare no more of the word of God, then we beleeve and practice, ſo the Lord heareth no more of what we pray (in a Scripture ſence) then what he granteth. There are two expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Scripture which note this.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To have regard to a perſon, or to a prayer (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.28, 29.) when <hi>Solomon</hi> prayed at the dedication of the Temple, the Lords hearing of prayer, which he then beggd, is thus deſcribed, <hi>Have thou reſpect unto the prayer of thy ſervant, and to his ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that thine eyes may be open toward this houſe night and day.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Reſpicere eſt audire.</note> So it is ſaid of <hi>Abel</hi> (Gen. 4.4.) <hi>that the Lord had reſpect to his offering,</hi> the Lord looked towards him, and accepted of him; to accept a prayer, is to heare a prayer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The hearing of prayer is deſcribed by the preſence of God with thoſe that pray. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.9.) <hi>Then ſhalt thou call, and the Lord ſhall anſwer, thou ſhalt cry, and he ſhall ſay, here I am.</hi> This is a wonderfull condeſcenſion, 'tis even as when a Maſter cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to his ſervant, he anſwereth, <hi>here, Sir, here I am;</hi> and that is as much as to ſay, <hi>I am ready to your command, I am ready to doe what you will have me, here I am;</hi> ſo ſaith that promiſe in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Thou ſhalt cry, and the Lord ſhall ſay, here I am,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Adeſſe eſt a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>It is the Lords title, <hi>O thou that heareſt prayer, unto thee ſhall all fleſh come</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 65.2.) God is not onely <hi>A hearer of prayer,</hi> but he is <hi>The Hearer of prayer;</hi> to heare prayer is his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar prerogative and priviledge as wel as his goodnes and mercy; none in heaven or earth have a will to heare prayer as God doth, nor have any a power to doe it. No creatures eare is long enough to reach the complaints, nor his ſtocke large enough to ſupply the wants of all his fellow creatures. The crowne of this honour fits none but God himſelfe. <hi>He ſhall heare thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:153845:146"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>It is a great mercy, a mercy comprehending all mercy, to be heard in prayer.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He ſhall heare thee; Man cannot deſire a richer favour then to be heard of God.</hi> To have audience in the Court of Princes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the great men of the earth is a great favour. What greater worldly priviledge can a man have then this, that he hath the eare of thoſe who are greateſt in the world? When a man ſaith, I have the Princes eare, I can be heard when I ſpeake, we thinke he hath ſpoken enough to make him a man. How great a mercy is it then to have the eare of God? to have ready audience in the Court of heaven? that as ſoone as we call, the Lord is ready to anſwer, <hi>here I am, what's the matter? what would you have? it ſhall be done, your requeſt is granted.</hi> And to ſhew that to be heard by God is the ſumme of all mercies, or all our mercies wrapt up in one, the Scripture teſtifies that not to be heard of God is the ſumme of all judgements, or all judgements wrapt up in one. When the Lord refuſeth to heare, or ſayth he will not heare thoſe that pray, then wrath is comming upon them to the uttermoſt. Thus the Lord threatned the <hi>Jewes</hi> (Iſa. 1.15.) <hi>When ye ſpread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you, yea when ye make many prayers I will not heare, your hands are full of bloud;</hi> As it is an argument of the greateſt ſinfullneſſe of man againſt God not to pray; <hi>Powre out thy fury upon the Heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name,</hi> (Jere. 10.25.) So it it an argument of the greateſt wrath of God upon man not to be heard in prayer. He that is not heard receives nothing, and he that is heard receives all. And this is the Saints priviledge by Jeſus Chriſt, their prayers are heard, they have welcome audience at the throane of Grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually. And hence by way of Corallary from the former obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, we learne, that
<q>Holy prayers are fruitfull and gainefull prayers.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God hath not ſaid to the ſeed of Jacob, ſeeke ye me in vaine; Hee that goeth forth and weepeth bearing pretious fruit,</hi> (this pretious fruit faith and prayer, or the prayer of faith) <hi>ſhall doubtleſſe</hi> (there's no hazard nor peradventure in the caſe) <hi>come againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, bringing his ſheaves with him.</hi> His ſhowry ſeed-time ſhall
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:153845:146"/> be bleſſed with a fruitfull and plentifull harveſt. The wicked make many adventures, many voyages by prayer, ſuch as it is, heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, yet come home without ladeing, without any fraight at all. Their prayers are all loſt, and turne to no profit; and indeed theirs are not prayers but words, or babling rather. But holy prayer, the prayer of the holy is prevailing;<note place="margin">At quibus cum que tande<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis peccator o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, verum eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am eſt nunquam exaudiri pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torem ex digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate ſuae perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae aut meriti ſed ex dei gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia &amp; miſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia. <hi>Bold.</hi>
                     </note> Thoſe ſhowers of prayers and teares which beleevers ſend up to heaven, are like <hi>the raine</hi> (as the Prophet ſpeakes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.10.) <hi>which commeth downe, and the ſnow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give ſeed to the ſower, and bread to the eater.</hi> Even thus the word of prayer which goeth out of the mouthes, or hearts rather of beleevers, returnes not to them voyd, but proſpers in the thing whereto they ſend it. As ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares yet more fully in the next words of this verſe ſpoken by <hi>Eliphaz; He ſhall heare thee;</hi> What then?</p>
                  <q>And thou ſhalt pay thy Vowes.</q>
                  <p>That is, God will give thee the mercies which thou didſt pray for, and thereby give thee occaſion to pay the vowes which thou didſt make to him in caſe he performed thy deſire in prayer. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> is not exhorting <hi>Job</hi> (directly) to pay vowes; but he is aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him that his prayer ſhall be heard, and ſo fully anſwered, that he ſhall ſee reaſon and have aboundant cauſe to pay them, and to pay them both fully and chearefully.</p>
                  <q>Thou ſhalt pay thy Vowes.</q>

                     <hi>yet obligatory upon man;</hi> for howſoever as the word implyeth, there ought to be the greateſt freedome and voluntarines in making a vow, yet a vow being made, there is an obligation, a bond or tye upon him that made it to performe or pay it; He that voweth binds himſelfe, but he cannot unbind or abſolve himſelfe from his vow, nor can he retract or call in his lawfull vow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> I ſuppoſe, here mentions the payment of Vowes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the godly in thoſe times did often make Vowes. When <hi>Jacob</hi> (Gen. 28.20.) fled from his brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> he in caſe of his ſafe returne, <hi>vowed a vow, ſaying, If God will be with me, and will keepe me in this way that I goe, and will give me bread to eate and rayment to putt on, ſo that I come to my fathers houſe againe in peace, then
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:153845:147"/> ſhall the Lord be my God,</hi> (that is, I will owne and honour him, love and depend upon him more then ever) <hi>And this ſtone which I have ſet up ſhall be Gods houſe, and of all that thou ſhalt give me I ſhall ſurely give the tenth to thee.</hi> Here's the tenour and forme of the moſt ancient and famous vow that ever was made. Likewiſe <hi>Hauna</hi> (1 Sam. 1.11.) <hi>vowed a vow, and ſaid, O Lord of hoaſts, if thou wilt indeed looke on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give to thy handmaid a man-childe, then will I give him unto the Lord.</hi> We reade often in the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> of paying of Vowes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.13, 14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.14. And we have the command for it (<hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.4.) <hi>Pay that which thou haſt Vowed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, To explicate this Text, It may be inquired what a Vow is?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, <hi>A Vow is a ſolemne, free, and voluntary promiſe made to God, of things lawful, weighty, &amp; poſſible, to further &amp; help us to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God in our obedience.</hi> In which deſcription we have, firſt, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Vow, <hi>It is a ſolemne promiſe, not a bare promiſe.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the object; <hi>It muſt be made to God;</hi> Thirdly, the manner of it, <hi>It is a free and a voluntary promiſe;</hi> for though a lawfull vow lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a neceſſity upon us to keepe it, when once wee have made it, yet there is not an antecedent neceſſity of compulſion upon us to make it; ſo that, a vow ought to be a moſt free, and voluntary act. Fourthly, in this deſcription of a vow, we have the generall matter of it. As firſt, it muſt be of things lawfull, wee may not vow that which we may not doe, eyther expreſſely, as they did (<hi>Act.</hi> 23.12, 13.) who vowed to kill <hi>Paul,</hi> or implicitly, as <hi>Herod</hi> did who promiſed to give the daughter of <hi>Herodias</hi> whatſoever ſhe ſhould aske, limiting her onely as to the quantitie of her demand, ſhe muſt not aske above halfe the kingdome, but leaving her without limits as to the quality of her demand, whether good or evill, lawfull or unlawfull made no matter. And thus many conceive <hi>Jephtah</hi> fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, implicitly vowing to doe that, which was unlawfull for him to doe, (<hi>Judg.</hi> 11.30, 31.) Secondly, a vow muſt be of things weighty and ſerious, wee muſt not vow about trifles. Thirdly, it muſt be of things poſſible, through grace, though we muſt vow weighty things, yet we muſt not vow things impoſſible, eyther in their own nature, or without extraordinary aſſiſtance and ſtrength from God. Fifthly, we have here the ends of a vow; firſt, to Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:153845:147"/> God; ſecondly, to oblidge us more ſtrictly to obedience.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is lawfull to make a Vow.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the Scripture teſtimonies before alledged confirme that propoſition.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Vowes lawfully made, ought to be kept.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou ſhalt pay thy vowes,</hi> hath in it the nature both of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and of a command; Vowes are bonds, we muſt take heed of breaking them; if wee breake our vowes, God will breake our peace. The word which we tranſlate <hi>to pay a vow,</hi> ſignifies alſo to give peace and quietneſſe, implying that till the vow be payd wee cannot have peace. A man that is in bonds to men hath no peace till he diſchargeth or hath prepared to diſcharge his debt, and therefore an acquittance or a diſcharge for a debt, is commonly called, <hi>A quietus eſt,</hi> implying that till a man hath got a diſcharge, he is not at quiet. We are at our liberty whether we will vow or no, but we are not at our liberty whether we will pay our vowes or no. And therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> doth not onely exhort to the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of vowes, but to the ſpeedy payment of them (<hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.4.) <hi>When thou voweſt a vow unto God deferre not to pay it, for he hath no pleaſure in fooles;</hi> That is, he is greatly diſpleaſed with fooles; he means it not of ſuch as are called fooles for the want of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral underſtanding, but for the want of a good conſcience, &amp; ſuch are all they, who flatter God with their haſtines in making vowes, and then mock him by their ſlownes in or neglect of paying them. And therefore, take foure Cautions about Vowes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Be not frequent in making vowes; vowing muſt not be like praying, <hi>an every days work,</hi> we may not vow, as we muſt pray, alwayes, and without ceaſing. Many have brought themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great ſnares by multiplying vowes; and we have need to be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in this thing, becauſe the nature of man is carried much to it. The Heathens made many vowes, eſpecially when they were in any diſtreſſe, and ſo meere carnal men will doe to this day, vow great things, what they will be, and what they will doe, if trouble be upon them. It is ſayd that thoſe Heathen Marriners made vowes when the ſtorme was over and the danger paſt (<hi>Jon.</hi> 1.16.) Many make vowes in a ſtorme whether at Sea or Land, which they little
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:153845:148"/> minde when the ſtorme is done. But thoſe Heathens (which may be a rebuke to ſome Chriſtians) made vowes of praiſe and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnes when they had eſcaped the ſtorme. And this is a further proofe of that naturalnes which is in man to make vowes. And the reaſon of it is, becauſe this ſatisfieth a natural man, and fills him with confidence that he ſhall receive good from God, becauſe he hath vowed duty to him. Man loves to be upon his owne bottome, and thinkes he ſhall ſurely engage God to be mercifull, while him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe promiſeth to be dutifull and thankfull. Now (I ſay) though there be ſtill a lawfullnes of vowes in theſe Goſpel times, yet take heed of making many vowes, eſpecially of conceiting to oblidge God by any of them. As the former may prove a ſnare, and an entanglement to us, ſo the latter is a diſhonour to God, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhewes us mercy more freely, then when wee binde our ſelves moſt to duty.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>When ever you vow be ſure you doe it in the ſtrength of Chriſt.</hi> None diſcover more weakeneſs in keeping vowes, then they who make vowes in their owne ſtrength, or not wholy in the ſtrength of Chriſt. Some have vowed never to commit ſuch a ſinne more, and they never committed it ſo much as after they had vowed. Some have thought to get cure and remedy againſt ſuch a corruption or luſt by a vow, and yet that luſt or corruption hath prevailed more upon them after their vow. The reaſon of all is, becauſe they have eyther put their vow in the roome of Chriſt, as if that could helpe them alone, or elſe they have made their vowes alone without relyance upon the power of Chriſt. That rule of the Apoſtle which obtaines in all caſes of duty, doth moſt in this; <hi>Whatſoever ye doe in word or deed, doe all in the name of the Lord Jeſus, giving thankes to God and the Father by him</hi> (Col. 3.17.)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In things which are directly commanded or directly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the Law of God, we are not to vow the doing, or not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the thing in it ſelfe, but only a greater care &amp; ſtricter watch over our ſelves, eyther for the doing of the one, or not to doe the other. As for example, we ſhould not vow abſolutely, that wee will not worſhip Idols, that we will not ſweare, that we will keepe the Saboath, that we will honour our parents, that we will doe no murder, for all theſe duties are expreſſely commanded by God, and are therefore paſt being vowed by us. Onely thus, wee (ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:153845:148"/> the treachery of our owne hearts) may vow more care and diligence in and about all theſe things. And thus wee are to underſtand that of <hi>Jacob</hi> (Gen. 28.21.) vowing <hi>that the Lord ſhould be his God;</hi> as alſo that of <hi>David</hi> (Pſal. 119.106.) <hi>I have ſworne and will performe it, that I will keepe thy righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. David</hi> kept them before, but now he would be more ſtrict then before in keeping them. So then, when we vow things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready commanded or forbidden, we muſt pitch and place our vow not upon the matter of the commandement, but upon the manner and intenſenes of our ſpirits in keeping it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Let not vowes about indifferent things be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. All vowes about things expreſſed in the Law of God muſt be perpetuall, becauſe the things themſelves are allwayes a duty. For the affirmative precepts of the Law are at all times binding, and the negative binde at all times. But as for things which are not preciſely under a Law; As for example, in the affirmative, to pray ſo many times in a day, to reade ſo many Chapters of the holy Scriptures in a day, to heare ſo many Sermons in a weeke; and in the negative, not to drinke any wine or ſtrong drinke; not to weare ſilke or lace for or upon our Apparrel, not to take ſuch or ſuch a recreation in it ſelfe lawfull. I ſay in theſe caſes, let not vowes be perpetuall but limited to a ſeaſon, leſt thereby wee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle our owne ſoules, and caſt our ſelves into temptation, while (through a zeale not according to knowledge) we uſe ſuch meanes to avoyd it. Make no vowes to binde your ſelves at all times in things which are not neceſſary at all times, eyther to be done or not to be done.</p>
                  <p>From the whole verſe, Obſerve;
<q>
                        <hi>That,</hi> the anſwer of prayer received from the Lord, doth call us to pay and performe all the duties that we have promiſed or vowed to the Lord in prayer.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though we doe not alwayes make ſtrict and formal vowes when we pray, yet every prayer hath ſomewhat of a vow in it, ſo that having prayed at any time, we may ſay, <hi>The vowes of God are upon us;</hi> for when we pray we promiſe, and then eſpecially we doe ſo, when we pray under any preſſure of trouble, or when we have any extraordinary requeſt to make; then, I ſay, we engage our ſelves in a more ſolemne manner to ſerve and walke with God.
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:153845:149"/> And ſo the returne or anſwer of ſuch prayers ingageth us more ſtrongly to duty. For whereſoever the Lord ſoweth, there he lookes to reape, and where he hath ſowed much, he looks to reape much; but then and there chiefly when we promiſe him fruits of duty for our receipts of favour and mercy. Did we take notice of this, we ſhould not be found as we are ſo much in arreare to the Lord, eyther for our private or publique mercies? What promiſes have we made in the day of our diſtreſſe? that we would be holy, that we would ſtrive againſt and mortifie our ſinnes, or the deeds of the body through the Spirit &amp; power of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Now let conſcience ſpeake; have wee performed our promiſes? have we paid our vowes? we can hardly ſay that we have put up a prayer which hath not had an anſwer by bleſſings and ſucceſſes; God hath been to us a <hi>prayer-hearing God;</hi> have we been to him <hi>a vow-paying people?</hi> Who amongſt us is now more active for God? or more carefull to pleaſe him then before? Who amongſt us is more watchfull over his heart, or more circumſpect in his walkings then he was before? Who is more carefull over his family, that it may be holy? or more zealous for the publicke, that it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, then he was before? What manner of men ſhould we be in all holy converſation and Godlines, did we but pay thoſe vowes and make good thoſe engagements which have gone out of our lips, and we have layd upon our ſelves before the Lord, in the day of our trouble? how juſt, how pure, how righteous a Nation ſhould we be were we what we promiſed our utmoſt endeavours to be? the Lord hath done much for us; let us up and be doing for him; let us make good what we have ſpoken to the Lord in vowing and promiſing, ſeing the Lord hath performed what we have ſpoken to him in praying and calling upon his name. God hath anſwered us at the firſt call, yea ſometimes before we called; let us not put God to call a ſecond and a third time, much leſſe often and often for the payment of our vowes. For though the Lord in patience waite many dayes for the payment of vowes, yet according to righteouſnes we ſhould not let him waite one day for it. <hi>All theſe ſpirituall debt-bills are payable at ſight or upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;</hi> God ſhewes us our owne bills and bonds wherein we ſtand engaged to his Majeſty every day, and every day (by ſome or other of his Atturneyes, that is, by ſome meanes or other) he makes his demand, therefore pay to day, pay every day, for we
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:153845:149"/> can never come wholy out of theſe debts to God, or ſay, we owe him nothing, how much ſoever, we have payd him. And know, that if when God hath heard us, we be ſloathfull in paying our vowes, eyther God will heare us no more, or wee ſhall heare of him (and that, as we ſay, with both eares) till he make our eares tingle, and our hearts ake for not paying them. Swift Judgements have often followed theſe ſlow payments. And though they have not been ſwift in comming preſently upon the neglect, yet when they have come, they have come ſwiftly upon the neglecters. And as wee may alwayes ſay of the evills and Judgements which come upon any of the people of God, as the Prophet in a like caſe doth to the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (Jer. 4.18.) <hi>Thy way and thy doin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s have procured theſe things unto thee this is thy wickednes.</hi> So in moſt caſes when evills and judgements fall upon and afflict the people of God, we may ſay, <hi>Your not doing what you have promiſed, hath procured theſe things unto you; This is your vow-breaking or your neglect of paying your vowes.</hi> And how juſt is it that their troubles ſhould not onely be renewed, but even doubled and trebled, yea, ſeventimes more encreaſed upon them, who ſlight and throw off thoſe very duties which they tooke upon them in the day of their trouble, in expectation to have their troubles removed. Every mans mouth will be ſtopt, when he ſuffers for not doing that good which the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken, how much more will his mouth be ſtopt, and he have nothing to ſay for himſelfe, who ſuffers for not doing that good, or for not forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that evill, which his owne mouth hath ſpoken, and ſolemnly charged upon himſelfe as a duty in the preſence of the Lord. They will have leaſt to ſay for themſelves who goe againſt or come not up to what themſelves have ſayd. Then <hi>pay your vowes.</hi>

                     <hi>Thou ſhalt decree.</hi> The word here tranſlated <hi>to decree,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies properly to divide, to cut aſunder.

                     <hi>thou ſhalt pay thy vowes;</hi> that is, what thou ſueſt for by prayer on earth, ſhall be decreed for thee in heaven. That is, thy prayer ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be performed, thy prayers ſhall not be loſt, no, They ſhall be as the Statutes and decrees of heaven. It is ſaid of <hi>Eliah</hi> (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.1.) what he decreed was done? and what was his decree? his decree was his prayer; See how he ſpeaks as if he had the command of heaven and earth, as if he had carryed the keyes of the Clouds at his girdle. <hi>As the Lord God of Iſrael liveth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom I ſtand, there ſhall not be dew nor raine theſe yeares, but according to my word.</hi> But what was this word of <hi>Elijah?</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>James</hi> expounds that for us, he telleth us what this word was, when <hi>Eliah</hi> ſayd, <hi>it ſhall be according to my word</hi> (Jam. 5.17.) <hi>Elias was a man ſubject to the like paſſions as wee are, and he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed earneſtly that it might not raine; and it rained not on the earth for the ſpace of three yeares and ſix months: And he prayed againe, and the heavens gave raine, and the earth brought forth her frruit.</hi> The Apoſtle explaines, what the word of <hi>Elijah</hi> was, even a Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-word, he prayed and ſought the Lord in that thing, and his prayer was as certainly performed to him, as if he had the whole power of decreeing what he would have. Thus here, thou ſhalt powre out a prayer, and thy prayer ſhall be as a decree eſtabliſhed with God. So we read (<hi>Gen.</hi> 32.24.) in the report of <hi>Jacobs</hi> wreſtling with the Angel, that the word of <hi>Jacob</hi> was as a decree,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:153845:151"/> 
                     <hi>I will not let thee goe, except thou bleſſe me;</hi> I will have a bleſſing; and it is ſaid, <hi>as a Prince haſt thou power with God, and with men, and haſt prevailed. Jacob</hi> had what he would in prayer, he decreed a thing, and it was eſtabliſhed to him. <hi>The prayers of Saints are decrees with God:</hi> and 'tis but reaſon they ſhould be ſo; becauſe their prayers anſwer the decrees of God, or they pray for that which God hath decreed; and indeed there is no Saint or Godly man would pray any other prayer, or aske any thing of God, but what God hath determined and decreed before to give: <hi>As a Godly man would doe nothing but what God hath commanded, ſo he would aske nothing but what God hath decreed.</hi> This is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable truth, yet I rather conceive the ſence of this place more generall, and not tyed up to that of prayer, and therefore</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Thou ſhalt decree a thing;</hi> that is, thou ſhalt take up a reſolve, or a purpoſe; thou in thy wiſdome and prudence ſhalt ſay in thy heart, I will doe ſuch a thing, or I would bring ſuch a thing to paſs,<note place="margin">Ordinabis per tuam providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam facturum aliquid, &amp; quaſi rem non futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram &amp; incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam, ſed quaſi divina jam vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntate conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam illam ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bebis. <hi>Aquin.</hi>
                     </note> and it ſhall come to paſs or be eſtabliſhed. For as many men mett together in Councell, make Decrees; ſo any man in himſelfe may make a decree; and we alwayes make decrees in our own minds before wee joyne in any decree with others; firſt, wee ſpeake in our mindes, then we ſpeake out our mindes; <hi>Thou ſhalt decree a thing;</hi> that is, thou ſhalt reſolve to goe ſuch a way, or to doe ſuch a thing, and it ſhall be done. Now, this Caſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing muſt be underſtood with a Caution, ſuppoſe the thing it ſelfe be juſt and lawfull (as wee touched before) yet a man muſt not make abſolute decrees (that's the priviledge of God, he onely can make peremptory decrees, who hath all things in his power) we muſt decree ſubmiſſively to the will of God, and ſay, <hi>if the Lord will, if the Lord pleaſe</hi> wee will doe ſuch a thing. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle (<hi>James</hi> 4.12, 13, 14.) reproves thoſe that would make pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory decrees of what they would do in reference to outward affaires: <hi>Goe to now yee that ſay to day or to morrow wee will goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a Citie,</hi> here is a decree, <hi>wee will goe to ſuch a place, or doe ſuch a thing, wee will continue there a yeare, and buy and ſell, and get gaine.</hi> It is lawfull for men to take up a purpoſe to goe to ſuch a place, and follow their trade to buy and ſell, and get gaine in an honeſt way, but no man muſt be peremptory in this, becauſe we know not what ſhall be on the morrow; therefore, the Apoſtle directs; <hi>Yee ought to ſay, if the Lord will we ſhall live, and doe this
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:153845:151"/> or that.</hi> Such decrees muſt be made with the Lords good leave, or with a reference to his pleaſure who alone doth whatſoever pleaſeth him. As the perſons ſo the workes of all men are in the hand of God (<hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.1.) And there they are; firſt, as to the performance of them; ſecondly, as the ſucceſſe of them. They take themſelves for more then men, who decree the doing of lawfull things without the leave of God. We muſt not onely ſee what we doe is according to the will of God, but we muſt have his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will for the doing of it; that is, as we muſt have a Law from God for what we doe, ſo leave from God. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us to ſpeake by his owne example (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.19.) <hi>I will come unto you ſhortly if the Lord will.</hi> And againe (<hi>Chap.</hi> 16.7.) <hi>I muſt tarry a while with you if the Lord permit.</hi> Once more (<hi>Phil.</hi> 2.19.) <hi>I truſt in the Lord to ſend Timothy to you ſhortly.</hi> And even Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens themſelves by the light of nature have acknowledged ſuch a ſubmiſſion as due unto their ſuperiour Power, <hi>their gods,</hi>

                     <hi>Eliphaz</hi> brings it in by way of promiſe, <hi>Thou ſhalt decree a thing, and it ſhall be eſtabliſhed unto thee.</hi> Succeſs in any of our right acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is to be acknowledged as a mercy; and therfore the Lord doth ſo diſtinctly ſpecifie the ſucceſsleſnes of the <hi>Jewes</hi> after their return from <hi>Babylon</hi> in their rural and houſhold buſineſſes for neglecting to build his houſe (<hi>Hag.</hi> 1.6.) to ſhew that he had a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie with them; <hi>Yee have ſowne much, and brought in little</hi> (no ſucceſs) <hi>yee eate, but have not enough, yee drinke, but yee are not filled with drinke</hi> (that is, yee are not ſatisfied) <hi>yee cloath you, but there is no warmth</hi> (which is the effect of cloathing) <hi>and he that earneth wages, earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes.</hi> Which is a proverbiall ſpeech, implying that nothing ſticks, nothing ſtayes by a man, no more then money doth in a bag that hath holes in it, or water in a ſieve, or in a leaking veſſell. Succeſsleſnes attended them in all they did, and that was their affliction. So when our Councells proſper, when what we adviſe to be done thrives in the doing; when the directing word of a man proves like the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting word of God <hi>(Gen. firſt)</hi> who did but ſay; <hi>Let there be light, and there was light, let there be a firmament, and there was a firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> &amp;c. Thus when a man ſhall ſay, let ſuch a thing be done and it is done, when every thing comes forth at a word, like a new Creation, how great both a mercy and honour is this? When he ſaith, let there be deliverance, and there is deliverance, let there be victory, and there is victory, let there be peace, and there is peace; when in caſes of greateſt difficulty and utter impoſſibility to fleſh and bloud, he ſpeakes like magnanimous <hi>Joſhua</hi> (Joſh. 10.13.) in a commanding language to the creature, while with ſtrongeſt confidence in &amp; humbleſt dependance upon God. <hi>Sunne ſtand thou ſtill upon Gibeah, &amp; thou Moone in the valley of Ajalon, &amp; the Sun ſtood ſtill, and the Moone ſtayed untill the people had avenged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon their enemies.</hi> Who of the ſons of men (who were not alſo the ſons of God) were ever crowned with ſuch an honour?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He doth not ſay, he ſhall decree a thing and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh it, for man may decree a thing, but man cannot eſtabliſh it;
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:153845:152"/> the decree is from one, the eſtabliſhment is from another; and who is that other? <hi>Eliphaz</hi> doth not expreſſe who by name, but we may eaſily underſtand who it is, even God himſelfe. For as it is God alone who hath given a being to all things, ſo he alone gives all things their eſtabliſhment, whether they be things wrought by him, or wrought by us, <hi>God ſhall eſtabliſh it,</hi> or <hi>it ſhall be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the fiat, and conſent of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve;
<q>The ſucceſs of our Councells and decrees is from God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are many who take wiſe, yea honeſt Councells, which yet are not eſtabliſhed, becauſe the Lord is not pleaſed to eſtabliſh them, and the Lord doth often overthrow evill and malitious Counſels. We read (<hi>Eſay.</hi> 7.5, 6, 7.) of Councells and Decrees made; <hi>Syria, Ephraim, and the ſon of Remaliah, have taken evill Councell againſt thee, ſaying</hi> (they decree a thing, what was it) <hi>let us goe up againſt Judah to vex it</hi> (there was the decree) <hi>let us make a breach therein for us, and ſet a king in the midſt of it, even the Son of Tabeal.</hi> Here was their decree; we will vex this people, we will ſet a king among them, the Son of <hi>Tabeal.</hi> But what ſaith the Lord to this? <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God</hi> (7 ver.) <hi>it ſhall not ſtand, neyther ſhall it come to paſſe.</hi> It is this word in the Text, <hi>it ſhall not be eſtabliſhed.</hi> You have made a decree, but you have not my conſent for the Eſtabliſhment of it, and therefore it ſhall not ſtand, it ſhall not come to paſſe. Take another Scripture (<hi>Eſay</hi> 8.10.) The Lord doth as it were give them leave to make decrees: make as many decrees as you will, and ſit together in Councell, lay your Councells as deep as you can, <hi>take Councell together, and it ſhall come to nought</hi> (you may take Councell, but it is in my Power whether it ſhall ſucceed or no, and I have decreed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your decree, that it ſhall come to nought) <hi>ſpeake the word and it ſhall not ſtand.</hi> The ſtanding or not ſtanding, the fruſtrating, or the fullfilling of our Decrees and Councells, it is from the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When he ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt decree a thing, and it ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> be eſtabliſhed unto thee.</hi> We may obſerve;
<q>The Councells of the Godly are under a promiſe of good ſucceſſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They have a kinde of Aſſurance that what they ſay ſhall come
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:153845:153"/> to paſſe; though they have not an abſolute Aſſurance, yet they have much aſſurance, though wee cannot ſay in every particular Caſe, that their decree ſhall be Eſtabliſhed to them, yet their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees in generall are under a promiſe of Eſtabliſhment. Chriſt ſpeaketh concerning the Decrees of a Church-Aſſembly (<hi>Math.</hi> 18.18.) <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, whatſoever yee ſhall binde on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven; and whatſoever yee ſhall looſe on Earth ſhall be looſed in heaven;</hi> that is, I will Eſtabliſh your Decrees. If when you meet together in my name, you decree concerning a perſon to bind ſin upon him, he ſhall be bound, if to looſe or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him pardon'd, he ſhall be looſened, your decree on earth, ſhall be a decree in heaven, I will binde what you binde, and looſe what you looſe. Now in proportion, the Lord ſpeakes the ſame concerning the decrees of any Godly man; what he binds on earth, the Lord doth binde in heaven, and what he looſeth on earth, God looſeth in heaven; that is, there is an Eſtabliſhment of his decrees; and as the Church there hath a promiſe that the Lord will joyne with her in her decrees; ſo a Godly man hath a promiſe here that the Lord will joyne with him in his decrees. We have alſo an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent confirmation of it, (<hi>Eſay</hi> 44.25, 26.) The Lord is many wayes deſcribed in Scripture, but here he is deſcribed by diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and eſtabliſhing the Councells of men. <hi>He it is that fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the tokens of the lyars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wiſe men backward, and maketh their knowledge fooliſhnes.</hi> Here is a deſcription of God in reference to the diſappoyntments which he puts upon his enemies, in fruſtrating their Councells and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees; they boaſt of theſe and theſe tokens that aſſure them of good ſucceſſe, but the Lord fruſtrates their tokens. The Diviners ſay, O the Starrs promiſe good luck, and tell us we ſhall have good fortune; thus diviners boaſt, but the Lord <hi>maketh the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners mad;</hi> how doth he make them mad? by making them ſee things fall out quite croſs to what they have foretold or propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Againe, <hi>hee turnes wiſe men backward;</hi> that is, he turnes the Councells of wiſe men backward, when they have reſolved ſuch a thing, the Lord ſets it quite another way: this is the glory of God that he can give check to the Councells of the greateſt Polititians, and deepeſt Machiavells, he turnes them backward. Thus the Lord is ſet forth overthrowing the decrees of the wicked; but at the 26<hi rend="sup">•h</hi> 
                     <hi>ver.</hi> He is ſet forth eſtabliſhing the decrees of the Godly.
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:153845:153"/> He it is <hi>that confirmeth the word of his ſervant, and performeth the Councell of his Meſſengers; that ſaith to Jeruſalem, thou ſhalt be Inhabited, and to the Cities of Judah yee ſhall be built,</hi> &amp;c God <hi>confirmeth the word of his ſervant;</hi> which may be underſtood not onely of the word of Propheſie (though that be the ſcope of that place, as if it had been ſayd, when the Lord ſendeth forth his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and holy Diviners, 'tis not with them as with falſe Prophets and heatheniſh Diviners, who making promiſes from the Starres of heaven, not from the God of heaven, are fruſtrated and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted; 'tis not thus with the <hi>Lords holy Diviners,</hi> for <hi>he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth the word of his Servants.</hi> Now, I ſay, wee may underſtand that Text not only of that word of prophecy which the Lord puts into the mouths of his Servants by an immediate inſpiration) but alſo of that word of prophecy, or decree, which any one of his faithfull ſervants ſpeaketh or maketh according to his already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will. This word of his ſervants the Lord confirmeth alſo, and <hi>performeth the Councell of his Meſſengers.</hi> And the reaſon is (as was touched before about prayer) becauſe there is a ſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes between ſuch words and decrees of his ſervants, and his owne Decrees; for the deſignes of his ſervants falling in with his owne deſignes, &amp; ſo their decrees with his decrees, he in eſtabliſhing their decrees, doth indeed but eſtabliſh his owne. For the ſervants of God deſiering that their decrees may be ſuitable to the written or revealed will of God, they ſeldome miſſe of a ſuitablenes to the decrees of his hidden and ſecret will. So that their decrees are (as it were) the <hi>Duplicate</hi> or <hi>Counterpane of the Decrees of God;</hi> and therefore no wonder if they be under ſuch a promiſe of ſucceſſe and eſtabliſhment. The Lord ſaith concerning his owne Decrees or thoughts; <hi>Surely as I have thought, ſo ſhall it come to paſſe (Iſa.</hi> 14.24.) (Now if wee thinke as God thinketh, then what wee thinke ſhall come to paſſe too) <hi>and as I have purpoſed ſo ſhall it ſtand;</hi> If wee purpoſe as God purpoſeth, then our purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſhall ſtand too. Againe (<hi>Eſay</hi> 46.10.) <hi>I am the Lord and there is none elſe, I am God, and there is none like me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: declaring the End from the beginning, and from ancient time the things that are not yet done, ſaying, my Councell ſhall ſtand, and I will doe all my pleaſure.</hi> If then the Councells of Saints, be the Councells of God, he will doe all their pleaſure. That's the ſumme of this promiſe to <hi>Job; Thou ſhalt decree a thing, and it ſhall be eſtabliſhed unto
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:153845:154"/> thee.</hi> Which appeares further from the laſt Clauſe.</p>
                  <q>And the light ſhall ſhine upon thy wayes.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in this promiſe might poſſibly have reſpect to <hi>Jobs</hi> former Complaint (<hi>Chap.</hi> 19.8.) <hi>Hee hath fenced up my way that I cannot paſſe; and he hath ſet darknes in my pathes.</hi> As if <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had here ſayd, thou didſt Complaine a while agoe that God ſet darknes in thy pathes, doe thou returne unto the Lord, <hi>and the light ſhall ſhine upon thy wayes,</hi> or there ſhall be light in ſtead of darknes in thy pathes. This light may be taken three wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A light of direction, thou ſhalt ſee what to doe; So it anſwers the former promiſe, <hi>Thou ſhalt decree a thing, and it ſhall be eſtabliſhed unto thee.</hi> Thou ſhalt not make blind decrees, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees in the darke, thou ſhalt not decree at a venture, or at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; the light ſhall ſhine upon thy wayes; thou ſhalt have the light of the Word, and the light of the Spirit to direct thee in making thy decrees, and for the ordering of thy whole converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Light ſhining upon his wayes, is the proſperity of his wayes; as if he had ſayd, ſucceſſe ſhall attend thy undertakings, the favour of God and his bleſſing ſhall be upon what thou takeſt in hand; as the Sun ſhining upon the earth ripens the fruits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſo the light, heate, and influence of divine favour ſhall ripen thy undertakings, and bring them to a deſiered perfection. Light, in Scripture, is often put for proſperity, as hath been ſhewed from other paſſages of this booke.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The light ſhall ſhine upon thy wayes;</hi> that is, thou ſhalt have perſonall Comfort and Contentment in thy wayes; that's a different bleſſing from the former; 'tis poſſible for a man to be in a proſperous way, and yet himſelfe to take no Comfort nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in it. When theſe three lights ſhine upon any man in his way, or upon the wayes of any man, when the Lord ſhewes him what he ſhould do, when he proſpereth &amp; ſucceeds what he doth, and when he hath comfort &amp; joy in what he is doing or hath don, then the bleſſing is full. As the Lord <hi>meets him that rejoyceth in his way and worketh righteouſneſſe,</hi> ſo the Lord doth often meet thoſe that worke righteouſneſſe in their way, cauſing them to rejoyce; And then the light ſhines upon their way indeed. This is a further adddition unto the promiſe of ſucceſſe before given.</p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:153845:154"/>
                  <p>From the firſt notion of light, firſt Obſerve;
<q>The righteous are under a promiſe of direction and guidance by God, they ſhall ſee their way, and know what to doe, by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine light.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſteps of a Good man are ordered by the Lord</hi> (Pſal. 37.23.) That is, the Lord gives him light to ſee how to order his ſteps; He hath not onely an outward naturall light ſhining in the ayre, and an outward ſpirituall light ſhining in the rule, but he hath an inward ſpirituall light ſhining in his heart, or that outward rule planted within, as it followes at the 31 verſe of the ſame <hi>Pſalme; The law of his God is in his heart, and none of his ſteps ſhall ſlide:</hi> The law in the heart is a rule within, which directs the good man what to doe, and gives him ſuch good direction, that <hi>none of his ſteps ſhall ſlide.</hi> He ſhall not walke like a man upon glaſſe or ice, all whoſe ſteps are ſlips, or in danger of ſliding, but he ſhall walke like a man upon plaine firme ground, whoſe very ſteps are as ſure as ſtandings. As Saints who were darknes are made light in the Lord, in reference to their ſtate, ſo they have light from the Lord, in reference to their walkings; and as they receive a light from God whereby they know all things, that is, thoſe great things which concerne Eternal life (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.20.) <hi>Yee have an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction from the holy one, and ye know all things.</hi> Now as they have a light promiſed them, that they may know all things, that is, all neceſſary ſaving truths or doctrines of ſalvation for attaining the next life, ſo a light is promiſed them whereby they may doe all things; that is, all their neceſſary workes, buſineſſes, and affaires, which concerne their duty in this life.</p>
                  <p>From the ſecond notion of light, Obſerve;
<q>Righteous men, ſuch as turne unto the Lord, ſhall have a Bleſſing in their way, their way ſhall proſper.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As they ſhall have a light ſhining to ſhew them their way, ſo to proſper them in their way: God is a Sunne, and he is a Shield, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11.) And as he is a Sunne to give light, and a Shield to protect, ſo, <hi>no good thing will he withold from them that walke uprightly;</hi> That is, he will not hinder or ſtopp thoſe good things from them which their ſoules deſire, or move after, they ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper in their way, yea, when 'tis ſayd, <hi>He will not withhold,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:153845:155"/> there is more intended then expreſſed, for the meaning is, he will plentifully give forth or powre out all good things to and upon them <hi>who walke uprightly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the third notion of light, learne;
<q>That the Lord gives Godly men Joy and Comfort in their way.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though their way be a way of much labour, yea and a way of much danger too, though it prove a way full of ſweat &amp; trouble, yet the Lord will cauſe a light to ſhine upon them, and refreſh them in their way. <hi>To the righteous there riſes up light in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:</hi> The light of joy in the darknes of ſorrow, the light of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the darknes of trouble; They who walke in the light of truth and holines, uſually finde the light of joy and comfort in their way, and are ſure to finde it in their end. <hi>The wayes of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Pro. 3.17.) <hi>are wayes of pleaſantnes, and all her pathes are peace;</hi> and if at any time her wayes and pathes are not peace and pleaſantnes (as to the outward man they often are not) while we are travelling in them, yet they are alwayes ſo in the cloſe of our travells. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.37.) <hi>Marke the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace.</hi> Yea when others finde moſt trouble in their way, then God is neereſt to him for ſupport, as it followes in the next words.</p>

Thus the humble perſon is the ſame with the humbled per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; affliction is an humiliation, however the afflicted take it or carry it; and uſually it makes men humble, at leaſt in appearance and lowly in their lookes, whereas in proſperity men lift up their eyes uſually and looke ſoftily, as if they would reach heaven with their heads, while their hearts are farre from it. But affliction makes men ſtoope. We may underſtand the Text of a perſon who is humble when humbled, who ſtoopes downe quietly to take up and beare his croſſe, and doth not in ſtoutnes ſlight it, or in wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnes play with it, but is ſerious under the rebukes of God; <hi>Hee ſhall ſave the humble perſon.</hi>

                     <hi>He ſhall ſave the humble perſon,</hi> that is, the perſon who is low in his owne eyes, while in the greateſt worldly heights, the perſon that humbles himſelfe, and walkes humbly with God and men when moſt exalted. Thus the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> exhorts the brother of high degree, or the rich bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>to rejoyce in that he is made low</hi> (Jam. 1.10.) But if he be rich, how is he made low? he meanes it not of a lownes in ſtate, but of a lownes or rather lowlines of ſpirit. The brother of high degree hath no cauſe to rejoyce in his highnes, but when he is low in his owne eyes. Lownes of eyes is more then a vertue or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon modeſty, 'tis a Grace; That's in a ſpirituall ſence, the moſt Grace-full looke, which is the moſt humble looke. <hi>He ſhall ſave the humble perſon.</hi> But with what ſalvation? I anſwer; Salvation is eyther temporal and bodyly or eternal, uſually called the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſoule. We may expound this Text of both; The Lord ſaveth the humble perſon both body and ſoule both temporally and eternally.</p>

<q>That the Lord takes ſpeciall Care of humble ones.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord ſeemes to take ſo much care to ſave the humble, as if there were none elſe that he tooke care to ſave, or regarded what became or them, whether ſaved or no. And the Lord ſpeakes of proud perſons as if he contemn'd none but under that name and notion. (<hi>Jam.</hi> 4.6.) <hi>He reſiſteth the proud;</hi> he that is proud of his perſon, or parts, or eſtate, or witt, or power, the Lord reſiſteth him.

                        </gap>,</hi> or as that Text in <hi>James</hi> hath it, <hi>He giveth grace to the humble.</hi> What grace? There is a twofold grace; and both are given to the humble; Firſt, he gives them the grace of favour or good will, he is kinde to and reſpecteth the humble, or (as this text in <hi>Job</hi> hath it) <hi>Hee ſaves the humble perſon.</hi> Secondly, He gives much grace to the humble, as grace is taken for that gracious worke of the Spirit in us, forming up faith, love, &amp;c. in our ſoules. The Lord gives more of this grace alſo to the humble, that is, he addeth unto the graces which they have, and makes them more humble, more gratious: a man cannot be (in that ſence) an humble perſon without grace; humility it ſelfe is a great grace, and the greater our humility is, the greater acceſſion we have of other graces. Thus, I ſay, we may underſtand the text in <hi>James</hi> both wayes; <hi>He giveth grace to the humble,</hi> that is, he favours and reſpects them, becauſe they are gracious, and he addeth to or encreaſeth their graces. We have a promiſe very paralel to theſe of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and <hi>James (Pſal.</hi> 18.27.) <hi>Thou wilt ſave the afflicted people, but wilt bring downe high looks.</hi> The word which we tranſlate <hi>afflicted,</hi> ſignifies alſo one humbled, and humble, and ſo we might render the <hi>Pſalme; Thou ſhalt ſave the humbled or the humble people;</hi> and that the humble are to be taken in to partake of the priviledge of that promiſe, is plaine from the oppoſite Terme in the latter clauſe of the verſe; <hi>High lookes;</hi> that is, <hi>high lookers God will bring downe, but he will ſave the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſon.</hi> Men of low and meane eſtates are uſually wrapt up with great ones in the ſame judgement, as the Prophet ſpeakes (<hi>Eſay</hi> 5.15.) <hi>The meane man ſhall be brought downe, and the mighty man ſhall be humbled, the eyes of the lofty ſhall be humbled;</hi> there we have the meane man and the mighty man under the ſame wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:153845:157"/> diſpenſations of God. The wicked whether high or low, are farre from ſalvation, but God knowes how to make a diſtinction between the humble and the proud, when his wrath makes the greateſt confuſions in the world. <hi>Humility it is not onely a ſweet, but a ſafe grace, yea a ſaving Grace; wee never goe under the Covert of God ſo much as when wee walke humbly with God; He will ſave the humble perſon.</hi>

                     <hi>by this purenes it or the Iſland ſhall be deliver'd:</hi> and by the <hi>purenes of his hands,</hi> he meanes the purenes of his actions or adminiſtrations. The hand is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of action, and pure or cleane hands in Scripture are put for the purity or cleannes of our actions or converſation. While our doings are holy, our works righteous, juſt, and good, it may be ſaid our hands are pure. And wee may referre this eſpecially to prayer; <hi>Thou ſhalt deliver the Iſland of the Innocent, and it is delivered by the purenes of thine hands;</hi> That is, thou praying in the purity of thy hands, or with pure hands, ſhalt deliver the Iſland of the innocent, or (according to that other reading) thoſe that are not innocent. And then, purenes of hands, or <hi>pure hands,</hi> are put as a ſigne for the thing ſignified, the geſture, for that which is done in that geſture. The lifting up of hands is a geſture in prayer, and the lifting up of pure hands, notes the purity of prayer. (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8.) <hi>I will that men pray every where, lifting up holy or pure hands.</hi> Now becauſe 'tis uſuall in prayer to lift up the hands; and in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er no hands but morally pure or holy hands ſhould be lifted up (and ſo theirs are in Scripture ſence whoſe lives are holy) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee may well conceive, that when he ſaith, <hi>it ſhall be deliver'd by the purenes of thy hands,</hi> his meaning is this, it ſhall be delivered by holy prayer, or when thou prayeſt holyly, it ſhall be delivered. Thus <hi>Eliphaz</hi> doth not onely promiſe <hi>Job,</hi> that himſelfe in perſon ſhould be lifted up and ſaved when others are caſt downe, but that he ſhould be a meanes of ſaving and delivering others, and thoſe not ſome few or all his owne family, but that the whole Nation or Iſland in General ſhould eſcape and fare the better for him. <hi>It ſhall be delivered by the purenes of thy hands.</hi> Learne hence, this Great and famous Truth;
<q>That, a Godly Perſon is a Common good.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He doth good not onely within his owne walles, or to his owne perſonal relations, but hee is a Common good, a publique mercy, a general Bleſſing, whether wee Conſider general Bleſſings either negatively, or affirmatively, that is, eyther as delivering
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:153845:158"/> from evill, or as bringing in of good, every way the Godly man is a general bleſſing, he ſhall deliver the Iſland of the Innocent, yea thoſe that are not Innocent; the Lord will accept his prayer, and heare his requeſt for the deliverance of a place, though there be many wicked ones in it. <hi>Abraham</hi> (Gen. 18.32.) had that priviledge granted him, that for his ſake and at his ſuite the Lord would have ſpared the wicked, the not Innocent, thoſe who were moſt abominably poluted: if there had been but ten righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons there, <hi>Sodom</hi> had been ſaved from burning at the ſuit of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> Much more will the Lord ſpare the Iſland of the Innocent, that is, where there are a great many Innocent ones, at the prayer and requeſt of an <hi>Abraham,</hi> a man Eminent in faith and holines. How often did <hi>Moſes</hi> turne away the wrath of God, when it was breaking forth againſt the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (Pſal. 106.23.) <hi>Hee ſaid he would deſtroy them,</hi> (that is, the Lord ſaid it) <hi>had not Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes his choſen ſtood before him in the breach, to turne away his wrath leſt he ſhould deſtroy them.</hi> The Lord had as it were made a decree that he would deſtroy that people; but <hi>Moſes</hi> comes and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth for them, and the Lord ſpared them.

                     <hi>ver. The Lord repented of the evill which he thought to doe unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> by the purenes of his hands, holy prayer delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Nation that was not innocent, from conſumption in the flames of the Lords provoked Jelouſie. Againe (<hi>Jere.</hi> 5.1.) the Prophet is Commanded <hi>to run to and fro through the ſtreetes of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, to ſee and know in the broad places thereof, if he could finde a man, if there were any that executed judgement, that ſought the truth, and I will pardon, ſaith the Lord.</hi> One man ſhould deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the City that was not Innocent by the purenes of his hands. We ſee the Lord puts the whole iſſue upon this, <hi>if thou canſt finde a man.</hi> But were there not multitudes and throngs of men in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem?</hi> Why then was it propoſed as a matter of difficulty to
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:153845:159"/> finde a man there? Doubtleſſe <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was a populous City, and was filled with men; but a man ſo qualified, a man of Juſtice, a man that ſought the truth was hardly to be found there, and therefore <hi>if thou canſt finde</hi> (ſuch) <hi>a man, I will pardon it ſaith the Lord.</hi> How pardon it? There is a twofold pardon: firſt, a pardon of the guilt of ſinne; ſecondly, a pardon of the puniſhment of ſin. The Lord, upon the finding out of ſuch a man, would not pardon the guilt of all that were there, nor give them an everlaſting par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but pardoned they ſhould be as to preſent puniſhment and ruine, they ſhould be pardoned or ſaved from deſtruction for that time, if ſuch a godly man could be found among them. God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men ſave the wicked three wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They ſave them, when by their good Councell and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction they turne them from their ſinnes, and bring them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; this is a happy way of ſaving them. And thus a godly man may ſave the wicked, every godly Miniſter of the Goſpel is ſayd to ſave not himſelfe onely, but (in this ſence) thoſe that heare him; becauſe he offers and urgeth upon them the meanes of ſalvation. (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As they may ſave them thus by being a meanes of their Converſion, ſo they may ſave them by being a meanes of their Direction; One godly man may ſave a whole Land by his directing Councell, as well as he ſaveth many by his converting Counſell. Of this <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes clearely (<hi>Eccle.</hi> 9.14, 15.) <hi>There was a little Citie and few men in it, and there came a great King againſt it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Now there was found a poore wiſe man in it, and he by his wiſdome delivered the Citie.</hi> That is, He gave wiſe and wholeſome Counſel, which being followed, proved an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall meanes for the deliverance of the Citie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A godly man may be a publique good to ſave and deliver others by his Prayers and Interceſſion, by ſeeking the Lord that they may be deliver'd,<note place="margin">Haud tamen deus id ſemper facit, ne<expan>

                     </note> as the latter branch was opened, hee ſaves them by the purenes of his hands, lifted up in prayer. Yet wee muſt take this with a Caution; For wee cannot affirme it uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally, that the righteous have alwayes this priviledge (in the event) to deliver the Iſland or Nation wherein they are. But wee may ſay, that this is a priviledge which Saints have often been ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with, and which none but Saints have been honoured with at any time to be the Saviours and Deliverers of a people among
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:153845:159"/> whom they dwell; For wee know the Lord himſelfe hath given expreſſe Exceptions to this rule (<hi>Jer.</hi> 15.1.) where hee tells the ſtubborne <hi>Jewes</hi> by his Prophet; <hi>Though Moſes and Samuel ſtood before mee, yet my minde could not be toward this people; Caſt them out of my ſight, and let them goe forth; and it ſhall come to paſſe if they ſay unto thee, whither ſhall wee goe forth, thou ſhalt tell them, thus ſaith the Lord, ſuch as are for death, to death; &amp; ſuch as are for the ſword, to the ſword, and ſuch as are for famine, to famine.</hi> When he ſaith, <hi>Though Moſes and Samuel ſtood before wee;</hi> Some may aske, what to doe? I anſwer, wee are not to take it for a mute ſtanding before the Lord, but a ſtanding before the Lord with earneſt Prayers, Interceſſions, and Supplications, for the ſparing of that people; Now ſaith the Lord, though <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> (who in their generations were eminent godly men, and eminent favourites of God) though theſe ſhould ſtand before mee, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly praying for this people, yet <hi>my minde could not be toward them,</hi> that is, I would not ſpare them, nor ſave them from death, ſword, famine, or captivity, no not at their entreaty. And wee have a like Inſtance (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.14.) <hi>Though theſe three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it</hi> (there were but two named in <hi>Jeremy,</hi> but here three, though theſe three men, <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> were in it) <hi>they ſhould but deliver their owne ſoules by their righteouſnes ſaith the Lord God.</hi> They might have the priviledge mentioned by <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in the former verſe, <hi>When men were caſt downe, they might ſay, there is a lifting up,</hi> or there is preſervation for us, God will take care of us: but God would not be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, no not by <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> to ſave the reſt. So that there are caſes wherein the Lord will not heare the Interceſſions of the beſt of men for a ſinfull people. The Iſland of the wicked, or of the not Innocent ſhall not be delivered, no, not by the pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their hands; yet 'tis an experienced truth, that God hath ſpared a people for the ſake of ſome Godly found among them; yea the reaſon why the Lord doth not deſtroy the world which lies in wickednes, is, much, in reſpect of them who walk in holines. For were it not (as <hi>Eliſha</hi> told <hi>Jehoram</hi> to his face in reference to good king <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> 2 Kings 3.14.) that God hath regard to their preſence in the world, God would not ſo much as looke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ungodly, nor ſee them for good. This honour have all the Saints, and how great an honour is it to be a publique good,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:153845:160"/> to be a Saviour to an Iſland, to a Nation? Some indeed are of ſuch narrow ſpirits, that if they may ſave themſelves, and keepe their owne ſtakes, they care not what becomes of the publique. But as it is a great honour to be active for the ſaving and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of a Nation, ſo it is a greater honour to have the ſafety and deliverance of a Nation attributed or given in to us by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe (though not at all by way of deſert, yet) in a way of favour. <hi>Paul</hi> was at Sea with no good company, yet when all looked to be ſwallowed up, <hi>An Angel of God appeared to him, ſaying, Feare not Paul, Thou muſt be brought before Caeſar, and lo, God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee all them that ſayle with thee</hi> (Acts 27.23, 24.) That is, for thy ſake, or becauſe they are now in thy company, they alſo ſhall eſcape the rage of this tempeſt. They all owe their lives to thee henceforth as well as to mee, for <hi>to thee have I given them.</hi> The men of this world might hence take notice of their own folly, who can hardly afford them a good word, or roome to live in the world, for whoſe ſake it is that they live. How often doe they wiſh and ſeeke their deſtruction, for whoſe ſake it is, that themſelves are not deſtroyed? How often doe they accuſe the Godly, as the troublers of a Nation, as the hinderers of publique good: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they <hi>are indeed a common good, The Chariots and horſemen,</hi> The Protection and Defence, the Salvation and Deliverance of thoſe States and Nations where they are. The breaches which wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men make by ſinning, they make up by praying, to turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Lords wrath, that they be not conſumed. We read how the Lord Complaines, that there was <hi>none found to make up the hedge,</hi> to ſtand in the gapp when he was coming to deſtroy them. (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.30.) And it is ſayd of <hi>Moſes (Pſal.</hi> 106.23.) that <hi>he ſtood before the Lord in the breach, that he ſhould not deſtroy the Iſraelites.</hi> Which phraſe of <hi>ſtanding in the breach</hi> ſeemes to beare an aluſion to an Army beſieging a Citie, who firſt plant their Canon, and make a breach, and then come to the ſtorme. Thus the Lord deales many times with a people, he encampes againſt them, and batters them, he makes ſome breach upon them by trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and diviſions, and then expects that ſome ſhould ſtand in the breach, and beſeech him not to ſtorme them with the whole Army of his Judgements. And the Lord takes it well when any of the Valiant Ones, when any of the Worthies of his <hi>Iſrael</hi> preſent themſelves in the breach, praying with utmoſt importunity, that
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:153845:160"/> the Lord would withdraw thoſe evills which threaten to come in at the breach like armed men and lay waſt a Nation.</p>
                  <p>And foraſmuch as men <hi>of pure hands,</hi> or Godly men have this priviledge to be a <hi>common Good,</hi> by being the deliverers of Nations from <hi>common evills and calamities,</hi> I ſhall hint ſome few things from it more diſtinctly.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, We ſee wherein (under God) the ſtrength and ſafety of Kingdomes and Common-wealths doth conſiſt. It is not, ſo much, in the wiſdome of the Counſeller, or in the courage of the Souldier; It is not, ſo much, in Armyes at Land, or Navyes at Sea; It is not, ſo much, in walled Cities and fortified Caſtles; It is not, ſo much, in union at home, or in leagues and confederacies abroad, as it is in the <hi>purity of mens hands,</hi> or in the holines of their lives. <hi>Godlines is the Sampſons locke, wherein the ſtrength of a Nation lyes.</hi> A Heathen could ſay, that <hi>A people were never ſafe by the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their walles, while themſelves were falling in their virtues.</hi> It is therefore (if there were nothing better in it) good policy to encourage piety, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ndeavour the encreaſe of a Holy Seed in any Nation. For as the Prophet ſpeakes (<hi>Iſ.</hi> 6.13.) <hi>As a teile tree and as an oake whoſe ſubſtance is in them, when they caſt their leaves, ſo the holy ſeed ſhall be the ſubſtance thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, In this we ſee the honour which God puts upon Godly men. What can be greater then this, to be really (though perhaps farre from being accounted ſo) the Deliverers and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours of their Country? What an honour was it to <hi>Abraham</hi> when God told a King, that he was beholding to <hi>Abraham</hi> for his life, or that favour muſt be granted to him at the ſuite and as it were ſent him by the hand of <hi>Abraham</hi> (Gen. 20.7.) <hi>Hee ſhall pray for thee, and thou ſhalt live.</hi> An honour much like this God put upon <hi>Job</hi> alſo, at the latter end of this Booke (<hi>Chap.</hi> 42.8.) <hi>My ſervant Job ſhall pray for you, for him will I accept, leſt I deale with you after your folly.</hi> Such Honour (in ſome degree) have all the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Let men honour thoſe whom God honours thus; and let the Princes and Powers of the world be glad when they heare that they have many ſuch in their Dominions. When ſuch are ſubject to them, as rule with God. It is ſayd of <hi>Zerxes</hi> (the Greateſt Monarch in the world in his time) that when <hi>Themiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> came over to him (who was a man eminent for wiſdome and
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:153845:161"/> Eloquence) that, being over-joyed at ſuch a treaſure, he cryed out in his ſleepe; <hi>I have got Themiſtocles the Athenian.</hi> Spirituall wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome renders men a Greater treaſure to States, then moral wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome can. Surely then they who are ſpiritually wiſe deſerve to be rejoyced in. I am ſure it is not ſafe to let them be diſcouraged by whom our ſafety is eſtabliſhed, much leſſe is it ſafe to let them fall, by whom in their capacity kingdomes ſtand; leaſt of all, is it ſafe to caſt them downe, who (by the rule of divine politicks) <hi>are State-upholders.</hi> Therefore let me ſay this to all <hi>the powers of this world,</hi> doe not deſtroy thoſe who have the priviledge to be <hi>Saviours and deliverers.</hi> Yea, Take heed of deading and ſtraitning their ſpirits in prayer for you, above all, take heed of turning their prayers againſt you. Doe not provoke your owne Horſemen to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, and your owne Chariot-wheeles to run over you. As theſe are the beſt friends to a Nation, ſo the worſt enemies. Better have many outwardly oppoſing you, then one (upon juſt ground) ſecretly praying, or but complaining to God againſt you. They who have no power at all in their hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no not ſo much as to helpe or ſave themſelves, may yet deſtroy many by the <hi>purenes of their hands,</hi> that is, they holding up pure hands in prayer, may bring downe deſtruction upon many who are wicked, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of Chriſt becauſe their adverſaries. But that which they moſtly doe, and that which they worſt of all deſire to doe is, <hi>That Lands and Iſlands may be delivered by the purenes of their hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To ſhut up this poynt and Chapter, we ſee, <hi>that as the Saints are killed all the day long,</hi> by the wicked world, <hi>for the Lords ſake</hi> (Rom. 8.36.) that is, becauſe they owne the Lord and his wayes: ſo the wicked of the world are ſpared even all the day long, or as often as they are ſpared by the Lord, for the ſake of the Saints, that is, becauſe the Lord ownes and approves them and their wayes, and doth therefore give peace to the world, that ſo in their peace, they alſo may have peace.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, Some interpret it in favour of <hi>Job,</hi> as if he onely ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned his friends to the tribunall of God, being confident of a good iſſue there.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others enterpret it as a preſumptuous ſuggeſtion againſt God himſelfe, and the ſtrictneſſe of his proceedings with him, which they endeavour to prove upon (as they conceive) theſe foure grounds of his complaint.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe he <hi>complained</hi> that his afflictions were beyond all his <hi>complaints;</hi> and that what he had ſayd was but little to what he felt, or to the greatneſſe of his ſorrow (<hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2.) <hi>Eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And indeed it cannot be denyed, <hi>That he</hi> (who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he is) <hi>is juſtly judged as over-bold with God, who judgeth any of the dealings of God with himſelfe or with any other man over-ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere.</hi> But wee ſhall finde, that though <hi>Job</hi> complained often that his ſorrows (as to him) were exceeding great, yet he never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that (as to God) they were unjuſt.</p>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:153845:162"/>
                  <p>Secondly, (Say they) becauſe he complained, that he could not get admittance unto God, nor audience with him, which was a further aggravation of his ſorrow. This he proſecutes from the third verſe to the end of the ninth. <hi>O that I knew where I might finde him, that I might come even to his ſeate, I would order my cauſe before him, and fill my mouth with arguments, I would know the words which he would anſwer me</hi> &amp;c. As if (according to the ſcope of this expoſition) he had ſayd, <hi>I have waited long under my preſſures and burdens, with my petition in my hand, yea I have tendered up my petition, but as yet I can get no anſwer; Alas, I am greatly afflicted, yet, ſo farre from being releeved, That I cannot be heard, I would therefore gett neare God, to ſpread and order my cauſe before him.</hi> To be heard and to be releeved, are often in Scripture ſence the ſame thing, and alwayes not to be heard ſignifies as much as not to be releeved. Till the Lord gives us his eare, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gives us his hand, therefore <hi>Job</hi> muſt needs think himſelfe farre from being helped while he thought that he was not heard.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Becauſe he complained that the Lord did thus afflict and try him, when he already knew what he was, and what he would be after his tryall by the ſoreſt afflictions; when he knew that he was innocent, &amp; that he would continue &amp; hold out in his innocency to the end. That he would not be weary of well-doing, though under the worſt of ſufferings. (<hi>Ver.</hi> 10, 11, 12.) <hi>He know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the way that I take,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſayd; <hi>The Lords needs not doe this to try me, for he knoweth well enough who I am, and the way that I goe; he knoweth both the frame of my heart and the courſe of my life; he knoweth how it is with me now, and that I ſhall be found ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> I have often profeſſed my ſelfe to be, when he hath kept me to the utmoſt of his purpoſe in this fiery furnace of affliction. When he hath tryed me I ſhall come forth as gold,</hi> that is, <hi>when all's done, he knows that I ſhall hereafter approve my ſelfe upright in heart, and that (through his grace, already beſtowed upon me) I have hetherto kept his way, and not declined nor gon back ftom the commandements of his lips, yea that I have eſteemed the words of his mouth more then my neceſſary food.</hi> Thus <hi>Job</hi> is conceived complaining upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that he ſhould be ſo extreamely afflicted, though the Lord knew his way, and that he was both a lover of his Word, and a keeper of his Commandements, and that he would perſevere with joy in keeping them to the end, though he ſhould not ſee the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected and deſiered end of thoſe ſorrows.</p>
                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:153845:162"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, Becauſe he is conceived complaining that he found the Lord altogether inexorable, ſo that no impreſſion could be made upon him by any thing he could ſay or doe to take him off from his ſeverity towards him. (<hi>Ver.</hi> 13, 14.) <hi>He is of one minde, who can turne him</hi> (there is no dealing with God) <hi>and what his ſoule deſireth, even that he doth</hi> (let it fall where and on whom it will, he will doe it) <hi>for he performeth the thing that is appoynted for me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From all which <hi>Job</hi> inferreth, that he had cauſe enough to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, much more that he did not complaine without cauſe. (<hi>Ver.</hi> 15, 16, 17.) <hi>Therefore am I troubled at his preſence when I conſider, I am afraid of him, for God makes my heart ſoft, and the Allmighty troubleth me, becauſe I was not cut off before the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, neither hath he covered the darkneſſe from my face.</hi> Thus you have the parts and ſcope of the whole Chapter, as 'tis ſuppoſed to be an over-bold complaint in reference to the dealings of the Lord with him.</p>
                  <p>From all which 'tis concluded,<note place="margin">Saepe antea ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuerat Job, ſe amicorum exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerbantibus ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monibus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But I rather apprehend (according to the former interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this reply) that <hi>Job</hi> doth here plainly hold forth an anſwer to what <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had objected or layd to his charge, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill ſo hotly oppoſed, he doth firſt defend his owne integrity in this Chapter; and that, ſecondly, in the next he overthroweth the ground or foundation upon which his friends built their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall oppoſition: affirming, that there is neither any certaine time nor way in which the Lord doth puniſh wicked men in this world, and that therefore no argument can be framed, or judgement given of any mans condition by his preſent ſtate, or the external diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of God towards him. Taking this ſence, we may reduce the whole Chapter to theſe two parts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A preface; ſecondly, the pleading it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The preface is layd downe in the ſecond verſe; <hi>Even to day is
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:153845:163"/> my complaint bitter, my ſtroake is heavier then my groaning;</hi> the pleading follows in the ſubſequent parts of the Chapter; the ſumme of which may be collected into this formal Argumentation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yee doe falſely accuſe him of wickedneſſe, and hypocriſie, who is ready to plead his cauſe, and doth earneſtly deſire that he may doe it before the throane of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But I am ready and doe earneſtly deſire to plead my cauſe before the throane of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore yee falſely accuſe mee of wickednes and hypocriſie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The aſſumption only of this Syllogiſme is handled in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, from the ſecond verſe to the end; in which it appeares, that <hi>Job</hi> was ready not onely to diſpute the poynt in controverſie with his friends, but was moſt willing that the Lord ſhould have the hearing of it; for ſo he ſayth, <hi>O that I knew where I might finde him, that I might come even to his ſeate, I would order my cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and fill my mouth with arguments.</hi> That is, I would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch arguments for my ſelfe, and againſt my oppoſers, as would render my cauſe juſt and innocent before God, how guilty ſoever I am found and repreſented in the opinion of men.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre concerning the general ſtate of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall next proceed to explicate the parts and particulars of it.</p>

                  <p>Thus <hi>Job</hi> begins, This is at once his prologue to what he had to ſay, and his Apology for what he had (paſſionately) ſayd alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. <hi>Even to day,</hi> or <hi>even this day.</hi> The word <hi>day</hi> is taken eyther more largely for the time neere at hand, or ſtrictly, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.8.) <hi>To day if ye will heare his voyce, harden not your hearts;</hi> That is, <hi>Heare his voyce this inſtant day, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den not your hearts one day longer.</hi> Againe (<hi>Deut.</hi> 4.8.) <hi>What Nation is there ſo great, that hath ſtatutes and judgements ſo righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous as all this law, that I have ſet before you this day,</hi> or at this
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:153845:163"/> preſent time. <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaith to <hi>Eſau</hi> (Gen. 25.31.) <hi>Sell me this day thy birth-right;</hi> that is, let me have it now, let us ſtrike up the bargaine this houre, or before we part. Thus here, <hi>To day</hi> &amp;c. As if <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid, <hi>O friend Eliphaz, I perceive that after all thoſe dayes of diſputation which have paſſed between us, this day is like to be ſpent and run out in as harſh cenſures on your part, and in as bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter complaints on my part as any of the former.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Even this day is my complaint bitter.</q>
                  <p>The word rendered <hi>complaint,</hi> is tranſlated alſo ſometimes <hi>prayer,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>meditation.</hi> (Gen. 24.69.) <hi>Iſack went out into the field to meditate,</hi> we put in the Margin, <hi>to pray. Hannah</hi> uſeth the ſame word (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.16.) <hi>Account not thy handmaide for a daughter of Beliall, for out of the abundance of my complaint</hi> (we put in the Margin, <hi>Meditation) and griefe, have I ſpoken hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto.</hi> Many complaine, who pray not, ſome pray, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine not, and others meditate, who doe neyther complaine nor pray, yet uſually we meditate, that we may conſider what to pray about, &amp; in prayer powre out our complaints both about thoſe ſins and wants and mercies, which have fallen under our meditation.</p>
                  <q>Even to day is my complaint bitter.</q>
                  <p>The Original word hath a twofold derivation,<note place="margin">Aliqui deducunt a <gap reason="foreign">

Bitter things are troubleſome to ſence, and troubles are bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Spirit. <hi>Affliction is a bitter pill; thou writeſt bitter things againſt me,</hi> ſayd <hi>Job</hi> to God before (<hi>Chap.</hi> 13.26.) ſo that when he ſaith, <hi>my complaint is bitter,</hi> it ſounds thus much, my complaint is as great as great can be, and I have the greateſt reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine.

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The word comes from a roote, ſignifying to rebell, to diſobey, to be exaſperated, or (as ſome learned in the Hebrew
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:153845:164"/> give it) to vary or alter the frame of a mans ſpirit, and the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of his minde;<note place="margin">

So the word is uſed (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.26.) Where the ſacred Hiſtory tells us of a Prophet who was ſent out upon a Meſſage by the Lord unto <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and though he faithfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Meſſage, yet hearkening to the counſell of another Prophet, he was ſlaine by a Lion; <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, for as much as thou haſt diſobeyed</hi> (or rebelled againſt) <hi>the mouth of the Lord,</hi> (that is, the words that proceeded out of the mouth of the Lord,) <hi>and haſt not kept the commandement which the Lord thy God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thy carkaſſe ſhall not come into the ſepulcher of thy fathers.</hi> Thus the word is tranſlated by ſome in this Text, of <hi>Jobs diſobedience or rebellion;</hi> And they render the whole ſentence with an interrogation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Etiam hoc die, contumacia, (habetur) que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimonia mea? Contuman eſt queſtus meus, perſtat. <hi>q. d.</hi> non paret non cedet ſolatijs veſtris. <hi>Rab. Sol:</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>What, is my complaint this day accounted rebellion?</hi> as if I did contumaciouſly ſet my ſelfe againſt God, while I am powring out my ſorrows before him; whereas indeed, my complaint is rather rebellious or ſtout againſt your conſolations, it yeelds not to them, nor is at all abated by them. The way or courſe which you take to comfort me, is too weake to graple with, much more is it too weake to conquer and ſubdue my ſorrows.</p>
                  <p>Yet further, This ſence and tranſlation of the word, may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to that ſpeech of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in the former Chapter (<hi>ver.</hi> 21.) exhorting <hi>Job</hi> to <hi>acquaint himſelfe with God, and to be at peace.</hi> As if he had ſayd, <hi>Leave off thy diſtances, lay downe the weapons of that moſt unholy warre which thou haſt taken up againſt God.</hi> To which cloſe rebuke <hi>Job</hi> anſwers here, what? <hi>Is my complaint to God looked upon by you as a combate with God? or do ye thinke that while I beg pity and favour of God, I have bid him defiance, or declared my ſelfe his enemy? What elſe can be the meaning of it, that you exhort me ſo ſeriouſly to reconcile my ſelfe to God? He that is called to make peace with another, is ſuppoſed to be at warre with him, or at leaſt to beare him ill will.</hi> So then, according to this rendering, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Text, the drift of his ſpeech is to ſhew how little ground there was, yea how unjuſt it was, that he ſhould be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of rebellion and contumacy againſt God, while he was onely
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:153845:164"/> bemoaning his owne ſad condition, and putting up his complaint to God. We may forme up his ſence into this argumentation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He cannot be juſtly accuſed of rebellion againſt God, who complains much, or greatly, when his griefe is more or greater.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But my griefe is more and greater then my complaint.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore I cannot be juſtly accuſed of rebellion againſt God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I complaine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, The text is thus rendred;<note place="margin">Etiam hodiè eſt (vel ſuo loco manet) exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio querelae meae. <hi>Merc.</hi> Quaſi ex noxio medicamine vulnus crevit.

                     <hi>Even to day the ſharpnes or bitterneſſe of my complaint remaineth, or my ſorrow is as it was.

So that here he ſeemes to renew and confirme that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he had given of his friends in their procedure with him (<hi>Chap.</hi> 13.4.) <hi>Ye are forgers of lyes, ye are all Phyſitians of no value: O that ye would altogether hold your peace, and it ſhould be your wiſdome.</hi> And againe (<hi>Ch.</hi> 16.2.) <hi>Miſerable Comforters are ye all; Shall vaine words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou anſwereſt.

So here, when <hi>Job</hi> ſayth, <hi>My ſtroake is heavy,</hi> he would have his friends know that his were (in themſelves) no light afflictions (though there is a ſence in which all the afflictions of the Saints <hi>are light,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.17.) but grievous to be borne.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Some read the words thus, <hi>My ſtroake is heavier upon my groanings, or when I groane;</hi> As if he had ſayd, <hi>the more I groane and ſigh, the more I am wounded, I get nothing by my groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings but freſh ſmitings and additional ſorrows.</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, Others tranſlate the Hebrew word properly, not <hi>ſtroake</hi> (by a Metonymie of the effect) but <hi>hand. My hand is heavy upon</hi> (or becauſe of) <hi>my groaning;</hi> that is, <hi>my hand is

                     </note> that is heavy, which is not lifted up without difficulty. Now when the hand is weake we can hardly lift it to our head (as we ſay). The weake hand is a heavy hand, not becauſe of the weight of it, but becauſe of the weaknes of it, or want of ſtrength to weild any thing with it, or to hold it up. In this ſence we are to underſtand <hi>Job</hi> crying out, <hi>My hand is heavy becauſe of my groaning;</hi> As if he had ſaid; <hi>My ſtrength failes me, my hands hang downe, and through weakneſſe I am not able to lift them up.</hi> In the fourth Chapter, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> told <hi>Job,</hi> that he by his good counſel had formerly <hi>ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened the weake, or the looſned hands.</hi> Which forme of ſpeaking anſwers that of the Apoſtle (<hi>Heb.</hi> 12.12.) <hi>Lift up the hands that hang downe.</hi> Weakenes is as a weight faſtned to the hand, and holding it downe. The hand is never ſo much faſtned, as when it is (in this ſence) made lax or looſened The Original word here uſed intimates, that much ſorrow and trouble weigh downe the hand; <hi>My hand is heavy becauſe of my groaning,</hi> or (as we read) <hi>My ſtroake is heavier then my groaning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we have <hi>Job</hi> ſtill complaining and groaning; whence was all this? even from the ſence of his ſore afflictions.</p>
                  <p>Which may teach us;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That affliction doth uſually vent it ſelfe in complaints and groanes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While we are in the fleſh, we are ſubject to affliction; and all affliction is grievous to the fleſh, not onely to fleſh as it notes the corruption of the ſoule, but to fleſh as taken for the conſtitution of the body. <hi>Affliction will be felt; It makes the fleſh ſmart;</hi> and when the fleſh ſmarts, it may make him complain and groane who is ſpirituall; yea, complaints and groanes give ſome eaſe to our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. As the paine of affliction cauſeth groaning &amp; complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo groaning and complaining are ſome releefe in our paines: &amp; hence it hath been reported as one of the higheſt peices of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty not to allow thoſe who have been under exquiſite paines to complaine and groane; for though groaning doth not at all abate the paine, yet it doth ſomewhat divert our thoughts from it; and while we communicate it to others in complaints, we are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what the leſſe ſencible of it our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whereas <hi>Job</hi> checks his friends (according to the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:153845:166"/> ſecond expoſition of the words) for calling or accounting his complaint rebellion.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>That we are apt to miſunderſtand and wrongfully interpret the complaints of others.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many are ready to miſ-interpret that which we ſpeake delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, much more what we ſpeake paſſionately and complaining<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; <hi>Job</hi> ſpake ſorrowfully, and he was preſently judged to ſpeake rebelliouſly: he was but humbling and bemoaning himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, yet he was eſteemed as a man riſing up againſt and warring with God. While <hi>Hanna</hi> was making a prayerfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to God, <hi>Eli a good man</hi> thought ſhe was overgon with wine (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.14.) <hi>How long wilt thou be drunke, put away thy wine from thee.</hi> When the Apoſtles were uttering the great things of God, as <hi>ſome were amazed,</hi> ſo <hi>others mocked, ſaying, Theſe men are full of new wine</hi> (Acts 2.13.) There are two ſorts of words and actions moſt liable to miſ-interpretation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When we act or ſpeake highly in holineſſe; for then the world looks upon thoſe of ſoundeſt minds as mad, or vaine, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted or drunken, <hi>theſe men</hi> (ſaith the world) <hi>are full of new wine;</hi> whereas indeed (as <hi>Peter</hi> makes anſwer in the <hi>Acts) they are not drunken, as is ſuppoſed, but filled with the Spirit. Feſtus</hi> told <hi>Paul,</hi> that he was <hi>beſide himſelfe, that much learning had made him mad,</hi> when he heard the diſcourſe of his wonderfull converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Chriſt, and holy converſation in Chriſt (<hi>Acts</hi> 26.24.) And it ſeemes that ſome among the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had no better nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinion of him, elſe he would not have made ſuch an Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy for himſelfe and fellow-ſervants in Goſpel-worke (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13.) <hi>Whether we be beſides our ſelves it is to God</hi> &amp;c. that's a ſober madneſſe indeed which is to God. But thus ſtill we ſee they who act or ſpeake higheſt in grace, are cenſured as acting and ſpeaking below nature. And as theſe whoſe graces are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oving aloft, are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſuſpected of madneſſe,</p>
                  <p>So, ſecondly, they who lye below complaining under the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of nature by affliction, are as often ſuſpected of and charged with impatience. <hi>A troubled ſpirit can hardly judge aright of it ſelfe, and is ſeldome rightly judged by others.</hi> I will end this poynt with two Cautions. The firſt to all, concerning thoſe that are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted; The ſecond to all that are afflicted.</p>
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:153845:166"/>
                  <p>To the former I ſay, <hi>judge charitably of thoſe who complaine bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly;</hi> for as a man in a low condition knoweth not what himſelfe would eyther be or doe, were he advanced to the heights of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and power; ſo he that is at eaſe, and wel, knoweth not what himſelfe would eyther be or doe, were he in paine or overwhelmed with ſorrows. <hi>Extreames in any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ate are rarely borne with a wel or duely tempered moderation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, To the latter I ſay, let them expect to heare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves hardly cenſured, and learne to beare it: let not ſuch thinke ſtrange of their ſufferings, eyther under the hand of God, or by the tongues of men. <hi>Great ſufferers ſpeake often unbecommingly, and are as often ſo ſpoken of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Foraſmuch as the matter of this ſuggeſtion againſt <hi>Job, tumultuous and rebellious ſpeeches,</hi> at leaſt ſpeeches ſavouring ſtrongly of rebellion are incident to any Godly man in <hi>Jobs</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>There may be rebellion againſt God in a good mans complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings under the afflicting hand of God.</q>
                  <p>An unquiet ſpirit is not onely a great burden to man, but a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to God. Our diſſatisfaction with the dealings of God, carrieth in it (at leaſt an implicit) accuſation of him, or that God hath not done well becauſe it is ill (to ſence) with us. There is a rebellion againſt the rod as wel as againſt the word of God. For as our ſtrugling and ſtriving with the word of God and the unqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe of our hearts under any truth when it takes hold of us is rebellion againſt God, ſo to ſtrive, and ſtruggle, with the rod of God, or with the croſſe that he layes upon us is rebellion againſt him alſo. God ſpeakes to us by his rod as wel as by his word; and we ſpurne at God in wrangling with his rod, as wel as in wrangling with his word. Yea to have hard thoughts of God, as that he is ſevere, and rigourous, that he hath put off his bowells of compaſſion towards us, and forgotten to be gratious; ſuch thoughts, as theſe, of God under affliction, are rebellious thoughts. And as there is a rebellion in the thoughts againſt God in caſe of affliction, ſo alſo in the Tongue. Thus, to murmur is to rebell. I doe not ſay that all complaining is rebelling, but all murmuring is; we may complaine and tell the Lord how ſad it is with us, how much our ſoules, our bodies, our eſtates, our relations bleed and
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:153845:167"/> ſmart. We may complaine, and make great complaints without ſin, but the leaſt murmuring is ſinfull, yea in the very nature of it, ſo full of ſin, that it uſually and deſervedly paſſeth under the name of Rebellion. The children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were as often charged with rebellion as with murmuring; And therefore when they murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for want of Water, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayd unto them, <hi>Heare now ye rebels, muſt we fetch you water out of this Rocke?</hi> (Numb. 20.10.) And againe, <hi>Moſes</hi> chargeth this upon them with his laſt breath (as it were) <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.27. <hi>I know thy rebellion and thy ſtiffe necke, behold while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious againſt the Lord, and how much more after my death:</hi> yea the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe chargeth rebellion upon that unparalleld payre of Brethren, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> themſelves, becauſe they had not ſo fully as they ought at all times and in all things ſubmitted unto his divine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations among that people, (<hi>Numb.</hi> 24.) <hi>The Lord ſpake to Moſes, ſaying, Aaron ſhall be gathered unto his people, for he ſhall not enter into the Land which I have given unto the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, becauſe yee</hi> (the Lord puts them both together in the ſin) <hi>rebelled againſt my word at the waters of Meribah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, whereas <hi>Job</hi> ſayth; <hi>Even to day my complaint is bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>The Afflictions and ſorrows of ſome eminently Godly, ſticke by them, or continue long upon them.</q>
                  <p>It is with afflictions as with diſeaſes, there are ſome acute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, ſharpe and feirce for a while, but they laſt not, they are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in a few dayes; for eyther the diſeaſe departs from the man, or the man departs out of the world by the feircenes of his diſeaſe. There are alſo Chronicall diſeaſes, laſting, lingring diſeaſes, that hang about a man many dayes, yea moneths and yeares, and will not be gone while he lives, but lye downe in the grave with him. Such a difference we finde among thoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> other afflictions and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles which are not ſeated (as diſeaſes) in the body, but reach the whole eſtate of man. Some are acute and ſharpe, like the fierce fitts of a feavor, but they laſt not; or like Summers ſudden ſtormes, which are ſoone followed with a ſucceſſion of faire weather. But there are alſo chronicall afflictions, tuffe and unmoveable trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which abide by us, which dwell with us day after day, yeare after yeare, and never leave us while we live, or till we leave the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:153845:167"/> world. Many a good man hath carryed his affliction with him to the grave. If any ſhall object; how then is that of <hi>David</hi> true, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.5.) <hi>Weeping may endure for a night, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>t joy commeth in the morning.</hi> I anſwer; Firſt, That Scripture ſpeakes of that which is often experienced, but not alwayes: ſecondly, It is moſt true alſo that all our weeping is but for a night, yea but for <hi>a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.) compared with that morning of joy when the day of our bleſſed eternity ſhall begin. Thirdly, the <hi>Pſalme</hi> hath this ſcope cheifely, to ſhew, that the troubles of the Saints are not everlaſting, not that they are never laſting; or to ſhew that the night of weeping ſhall at laſt conclude in a morning of joy to the Godly, not that their night of weeping ſhall preſently conclude. For as ſome have onely a Summers night, or a ſhort night of ſorrow, ſo others have a winters night, or a long night of ſorrow. And this night of ſorrow, may be as long not onely as many natural dayes, or as ſomes yeares, but as long as all the naturall dayes and yeares of this preſent life. The mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of joy is not to be underſtood of the next morrow after the ſorrow began, for how long ſoever our weeping continues, it is night with us, and whenſoever joy comes (though at midnight) 'tis morning with us. For ſure enough as thoſe ſonnes of pleaſure are deſcribed (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.12.) promiſing themſelves the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their joyes; (<hi>To morrow ſhall be as this day, and much more abundant, therefore come fetch wine and let us drinke to day, there will be wine enough for to morrow too,</hi> thus they promiſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that their pleaſures ſhould continue in a ſucceſſion of many morrows, now as theſe ſonnes of pleaſure promiſed themſelves the continuance of their delight) ſo many of the ſons &amp; daughters of ſorrow have found and ſtill finde a continuance of their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and have cauſe to ſay, this day is even as bad as yeſterday was; yea our bitter cup, our wine of aſtoniſhment is much more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, our ſorrow is greater this day then it was yeſterday, that was a blacke ſad gloomy day, and this is a day more blacke, ſad, and gloomy then that was.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, From theſe words; <hi>My ſtroake is heavier then my groaning.</hi> Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>That the afflictions of ſome of the pretious ſervants of God, exceed, and ſurpaſſe all their complaints and groanes.</q>
                  <p>The groanes of ſome are heavier then their ſtroake, and the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:153845:168"/> ſtroakes of not a few are heavier then their groanes. Some ſhew more ſorrow then they have, and others have more ſorrows then they can ſhew. <hi>I,</hi> ſayth <hi>Job, cannot tell you no not ſo much as by the language of my groaning, how heavy my ſtroake is.</hi> As there <hi>is a peace of God,</hi> a peace which he giveth to many of his people in this life <hi>which paſſeth all underſtanding</hi> (Phil. 4.6.) they have a ſence of ſuch peace ſometimes upon their ſpirits as their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings know not what to make of it, they are ſo farre from being able to tell you what it is, that they are not able to conceive what it is, but muſt confeſſe that their peace is greater and larger then their underſtanding, now (I ſay) as the peace which God gives his paſſeth their underſtandings) ſo the troubles and ſorrows of many who are deare to God, exceed, or ſurpaſſe all their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, they cannot declare, nor can any for them, how it is with them. Againe, as there is in this life a joy in beleiving, which is unſpeakeable (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8.) ſo there is a ſorrow in ſuffering which is unſpeakeable. And (which is very wonderfull) theſe two meet ſometimes in the ſame perſon, who at the very inſtant while his ſorrow is ſo great that he is not able to expreſſe it, hath alſo ſweete and raviſhing joyes beyond expreſſion. Yet, I conceive (as to <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe) his ſpirit was darke, and his minde troubled, as well as his body was pained, and his outward eſtate torne and ruin'd.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, From theſe words; <hi>My ſtroake is heavier then my groaning.</hi> Obſerve;
<q>
                        <hi>That,</hi> it is ſinfull to groane and complaine beyond the ſtroake that is upon us, or to complaine more then we have cauſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> ſeemes here to yeeld it, and confeſſe, that if his ſtroake had not been ſo heavy, his groanes had not been innocent; and if it be ſinfull to groane, and complaine more, or beyond our ſtroakes, how ſinfull is it to complaine without any ſtroake at all? Some complaine without cauſe, and groane before they are ſmitten, yea, ſome are ready to complaine when they are incompaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with many mercies, and are not ſatisfied when they are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; they complaine, becauſe they have not what they would, or becauſe others have more then they, though themſelves have enough, if they knew what is enough. The Oxe and the Aſſe are a rebuke to ſuch; For as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaketh (<hi>Chap.</hi> 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>) <hi>Will the Aſſe
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:153845:168"/> bray when he hath graſſe, or loweth the Oxe over his fodder?</hi> Irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall creatures will not complaine when they have the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of nature. Surely then thoſe men act much below grace, who complaine when they have food convenient, and health con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, yea all things convenient (poſſibly aboundant) for the ſupport of nature; who complaine when they have not ſo much as an akeing joynt about them, or the ſcratch of a pin, no nor the want of a pin, nor of a ſhoe-lachet. Some complaine when they have meate enough, becauſe they have not ſauce, yea ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine when they have both meate and ſauce enough, the afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all things, not onely for neceſſity but for delight. What ſhall we ſay of them who are never well neyther full nor faſting; who are ſo farre from having learned the Apoſtles leſſon to be content in all eſtates, that are content in none. The people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> murmured not onely when they wanted bread, but when they had it; when they had Mannah they murmured for Quailes, and at laſt they murmured at their very Mannah, their ſoules loathed that light bread: Conſider how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>at their ſinne is, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine upon ſuch termes as theſe, who complaine before they are hurt, yea who complaine when they have no cauſe but to be very thankfull. Wee live in complaining times, many cry out of preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and burthens, nothing pleaſeth many among us, becauſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing is not as they pleaſe. <hi>Take heed your groanings be not heavier then your ſtroake,</hi> eſpecially take heed yee be not found groaning without a ſtroake, and complaining over your bleſſings; the Lord hath healed our ſtroakes in a great degree, but our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainings are not healed; If we be found complaining when we have no cauſe, or when we ſhould be giving thankes, wee may quickly provoke God to give us cauſe enough of complaining. God ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h heavier ſtroakes for them, whoſe groaning is heavier then their ſtroake, and he hath heavieſt ſtroakes for them, who groan when they are not ſtricken. When children cry for nothing, they are uſually made to feele ſomething which will make them cry to purpoſe. This humour is childiſh enough in children, it is worſe in men, but it is worſt of all in Chriſtians, who are alſo the children of God. There are two things which God will not beare in his; Firſt, when they grow wanton with a mercy; ſecondly, when they complaine without a croſſe. To complaine under a
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:153845:169"/> croſſe, is to act below grace; To complaine of a croſſe, is to act againſt grace. To complaine beyond a croſſe, is a defect of grace, but to complaine without a croſſe, is a defect in nature.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtles rule is (1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.18.) <hi>in every thing give thankes,</hi> and he gives his reaſon for it in the words which follow, <hi>for this is the will of God in Chriſt Jeſus concerning you.</hi> Now, if it be the will of God that we ſhould give thankes in every thing, then it muſt be againſt his will that we ſhould complaine in any thing. <hi>Complaining is contrary to thankeſgiving.</hi> A godly man may ſee two things in the heavieſt ſtroakes of his affliction, which may provoke him to thankſgiving, at leaſt, which may ſtop him from all immoderate complaining; Firſt, That God hath a reſpect to his good in his heavieſt afflictions, and that the iſſue ſhall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be good to him. Secondly, that how heavy ſo ever his ſtroake is, his ſin hath deſerved a heavier, and that God could have made it heavier, even his little finger heavier upon him, then his loynes have been. That our ſtroake might have been heavier may ſtop our complaining, but our hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ſt ſtroake ſhall turne to our bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, ſhould ſtirre us up to thankſgiving: In heaven there will not be the leaſt ſhadow of a cauſe to complaine; Thankſgiving will be all our worke, and the worke of all in heaven; And by how much we are the more in thankſgiving and the leſſe in complaining on earth (unleſſe it be of and againſt our ſelves for ſinne) the more heavenly we are. When we are ſtricken we ſhould complaine as little as we can, and we ſhould alwayes be able to ſay (as <hi>Job</hi> here) <hi>That our complaint is not greater then our ſtroake.</hi>

O That I knew where I might finde him!</hi> Who it is that <hi>Job</hi> would finde is not expreſt in the text by name, nor is there any Antice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the verſe before, with which we can Connect this relative <hi>him.</hi> Yet 'tis beyond queſtion or diſpute that he meanes God, <hi>O that I might finde him!</hi> that is, <hi>God.</hi> But why did he not ſay, <hi>O that I knew where to finde God,</hi> but, <hi>O that I knew where to finde him?</hi> I anſwer, He doth it becauſe his heart being full of God, he ſuppoſed that thoſe to whom he ſpake had their hearts full of him too, and ſo would eaſily underſtand whom he meant, or that he could mean none but God.</p>
                  <p>Wee finde ſuch kinde of abrupt ſpeeches (as I may call them) in other Texts of Scripture, ſtill ariſing from fullnes and ſtrength of affection in the ſpeaker. See how <hi>Solomon</hi> begins his Love-ſong, <hi>his Song of Songs. The Song of Songs which is Solomons,</hi> that's the title of it; How doth it begin? <hi>Let him kiſs mee</hi> &amp;c. Here is a ſtrange Exordium to a Song, none having been ſpoken of before, <hi>Let him kiſs mee with the kiſſes of his mouth!</hi> by whom the Church would be kiſſed ſhee expreſſeth not, but her heart was ſo full of Chriſt, ſo full of love to Chriſt her Bridegroom, her husband, that ſhee thinks it needleſſe to mention him by name, when ſhee ſpeakes of him whoſe kiſſes ſhee deſiered. Her love had paſſed through the whole Creation, through men and Angels, through all things here below, and fixt it ſelfe onely upon Chriſt her Lord and Love. Therefore ſhee never ſtood ſpeaking perſonally of him, but onely relatively, and leaves all to underſtand whom ſhe inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Thus ſaith <hi>Job, O that I knew where I might finde him!</hi> when as he had not ſpoken of any diſtinct perſon before, in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And wee have a like paſſage flowing from a like abundant love to Chriſt, in the 20<hi rend="sup">•h</hi> of <hi>John</hi> ver. 15. where <hi>Mary</hi> comes to the Sepulchre (Chriſt being riſen) and the Angel ſeing her weepe asked her the reaſon of it; To whom ſhee replyed, <hi>Becauſe they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him;</hi> having thus ſaid, <hi>ſhee turned her ſelfe backe, and ſaw Jeſus ſtanding, and knew not that it was Jeſus: he ſaith unto her, Woman, why
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:153845:170"/> weepeſt thou? whom ſeekeſt thou? Shee ſuppoſing him to be the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner ſaid, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou haſt laid him:</hi> Shee never names Chriſt, but onely ſaith, <hi>If thou have borne him hence</hi> &amp;c. becauſe her heart was full of Chriſt, ſhee thought his heart was full of him too, and that hee underſtood her well enough whom ſhe meant, though ſhee ſayd not whom ſhee meant. Thus in the preſent text, <hi>Job</hi> was to God at that time, as <hi>Mary</hi> to Chriſt, at a loſſe for him, not knowing where to finde him, God was as it were removed from him, as Chriſt was riſen from the Sepulchre; Therefore he complainingly and affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enquires; <hi>O that I knew where I might finde him!</hi> My ſoule is a thirſt for God, my heart pants after him, <hi>O that I knew</hi>
                     <q>where I might finde him!</q>

I anſwer, <hi>By faith,</hi> and reliance upon him; <hi>O that I knew where to finde him;</hi> that the Lord might not be at ſuch a diſtance from mee, as he hath been, but that I finding him might fix my ſoule upon him. That's a good ſence.</p>
                  <p>Yet I conceive in this place, wee may rather expound <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaking of God after the manner of Magiſtrates among men, who appoynt certaine places where to ſit in Judgement, where to heare Cauſes, whither all that are wronged and oppreſſed reſort for reliefe and right. (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.17.) <hi>Samuel</hi> was the Chiefe Magiſtrate, The Judge in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Now the text ſaith at the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, that <hi>he went from yeare to yeare in Circuit</hi> (as wee have the Judges of the Circuit) <hi>to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:153845:172"/> Judged Iſrael in all thoſe places, and returned to Ramah, for there was his houſe, and there he Judged Iſrael;</hi> As if he had ſayd, <hi>his ſtanding houſe</hi> was at <hi>Ramoth</hi> and thither all cauſes were brought and all perſons grieved reſorted for Juſtice in their ſeverall caſes. Hee rid Circuit every yeare, that all the people might the more eaſily finde him; yet he had a fixed ſeate. In aluſion to this practice <hi>Job</hi> appealing from his friends to God ſaith, <hi>O that I knew where I might finde him,</hi> and goe to him for Judgement; O that I might have Audience before him in this great buiſines.</p>
                  <p>But it may be ſaid, Did not <hi>Job</hi> know where to finde God? or was <hi>Job</hi> out of the preſence of God?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, the Lord carryed himſelfe to <hi>Job</hi> at that time as a ſtranger, and though he were with him (as he alwayes is with all his) yet he did not finde him; The Lord is with many of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple when they are not with him, that is, when they doe not finde him, or are not ſencible of his preſence. God is with his people, even when they walke through the valley of the ſhadow of death, yet they are not alwayes with God: yea God doth not alwayes manifeſt himſelfe to them while they walke in the moſt delicious and lightſome paradiſes of this life. God ſometimes hides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſo that they cannot make it out that God is preſent with them. God is never ſeene in regard of the inviſibility of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and he is often unſeene in regard of the obſcurity of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations: as <hi>Job</hi> ſhewes further at the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>Behold I goe forward but he is not there, and backward but I cannot perceive him.</hi> I goe forward and backward, that is, I goe every way, I take all courſes to finde him, but I cannot perceive God, for he hides and covers himſelfe with clouds, that our prayers cannot come at him; as the Church complaines (<hi>Lament.</hi> 3.44.) though wee are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes preſent to God, yet God is not alwayes preſent to us, that is, to our apprehenſion; as God is not at all preſent to our ſenſe, ſo he is not alwayes preſent to our faith; that's the meaning of <hi>Job,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>I goe forward but he is not there,</hi> &amp;c. God is every where; whither <hi>can I goe from his preſence</hi> (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 139.) <hi>If I goe up into heaven he is there</hi> &amp;c. yet ſaith <hi>Job, if I goe forward he is not there,</hi> that is, I have no Enjoyments of God there; and upon this ground he ſaith in the preſent text, <hi>O that I knew where I might finde him! Job</hi> was well acquainted with the doctrine of Gods Omnipreſence, he was farre from thinking that
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:153845:173"/> there was any certaine place where God was fixt, and whether he muſt repaire as to the Kings and Princes of this world for helpe. <hi>Job</hi> knew better Divinity then this, he was acquainted with the nature and divine perfections of God, but he ſpeaks as to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent want, <hi>O that I knew where I might finde him!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve firſt,
<q>A godly man hath earneſt and longing deſires after God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whatſoever, or whomſoever he findes, he thinks he hath found nothing, or no body till he findes God; <hi>O that I might finde him!</hi> How doth <hi>David (Pſal.</hi> 42.1, 2.) ſhew his unſatisfiednes till he found God. <hi>As the hart panteth after the water Brookes, ſo panteth my ſoule after thee, O God, my ſoule thirſteth for God, for the living God, when ſhall I come and appeare before God?</hi> nothing but God was in his mouth, nothing in his deſire; <hi>David</hi> had a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <hi>David</hi> had a Throne, <hi>David</hi> had honour and riches as much as he could deſire, why would not theſe ſatisfie his thirſt? Could not he ſit downe in theſe Enjoyments? no! <hi>David</hi> was hungry and thirſty, and pineing, and empty, and ſtarveing, and dying, till he had God, till he had this ſpeciall Enjoyment of God; for ſo wee are to Expound that text, as this. <hi>A wicked man can take up on this ſide God,</hi> Cares not to finde him, nay, is afraid to be found of him; he then ſaith (according to the text touched before) as <hi>Ahab</hi> to <hi>Elijah, Haſt thou found mee O mine Enemy?</hi> He would be glad if God would never finde him, nor he finde God. (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 10.4.) <hi>The wicked through the pride of his Countenance will not ſeeke after God.</hi> The ſeat of pride is in the heart, but the proſpect of pride is in the face; <hi>through the pride of his Countenance,</hi> that is, by reaſon of that pride which doth diſcover it ſelfe in his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which breakes out there, he will not <hi>ſeeke after God,</hi> his pride will not let him ſeeke after God. He that is proud, ſeeth not his need of God, and he that ſeeth not his need of God will never ſeeke after him. Such a one is ſo farre from longing after God, or ſaying, <hi>O that I might know where I might finde him,</hi> that hee will not ſo much as looke after him, when he is told where he may be found. And not onely ſo, but, <hi>God is not in all his thoughts;</hi> or as ſome render it, <hi>all his thoughts are, there is no God;</hi> yea not onely are all his thoughts, but all his hopes are, that there is no God; if hee can but ſtrengthen himſelfe in the unbeleef of a God,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:153845:173"/> then he is well; all the thoughts and hopes that pleaſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light him are that there is no God, ſo farre is he from being ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous to know God. <hi>'Tis a condition equally ſad eyther when all a mans thoughts are, that there is no God, or when God is not in all his thoughts.</hi> A wicked man may talke of God ſometimes, but God never comes neer his heart, as the Prophet ſpeakes (<hi>Jer.</hi> 12.2.) <hi>Thou art neare in their mouth, but farre from their reines;</hi> that is, from their deſires and delights. 'Tis what our reines ſay, not what our mouthes ſay, that God reſpects. A Godly mans chiefe care is to be accepted with God, his thoughts are for God, and of God; and were it not for this thought, <hi>that God is,</hi> or that there is a God, and he a holy God, a juſt God, a gracious God, he would not thinke himſelfe (as wee ſay) worth the ground hee goes upon. And as all his thoughts are that there is a God, ſo all his hope and faith is in him, and his deſires are after him; <hi>O that I might finde him, enjoy him, graſpe him, take hold on him,</hi> who is <hi>The All</hi> of my deſires and hopes and thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve;
<q>That a Godly man is ſometimes at a loſs for God, and cannot tell where to finde him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He hath no ſenſibly-ſpirituall Enjoyment of him; The children of light often walke in darkenes; They who feare the Lord much, may be without the feelings of his love, and they who obey his holy commandements without the comfort of his pretious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Even Chriſt himſelfe was at ſuch a loſs for God, when he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me</hi> (Pſal. 22.1.) Chriſt being to ſuffer for ſinners, taſted of all thoſe ſorts of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which are due to ſin; He endured not onely the puniſhment of ſence in the paines of his body, but the puniſhment of loſſe in the hidings of his fathers comfortable preſence from his ſoule. If this were done to the Greene tree, much more to the dry, and if our head found an interruption of the preſence of God, much more may we, who are his members.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Obſerve;
<q>That while Saints are at a loſs for God, their deſires are often quicker and more ſtirring after God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a ſad thing not to finde God, but it is farre ſadder to have
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:153845:174"/> no deſires after him: Unbeleevers are alwayes at a loſs for God, they live without God in the world, ſuch a life is a very death, but this is more deadly that they have no deſires after God, that they make no enquiry, no ſearch after him. Though <hi>Job</hi> were at a loſs for God, yet his heart was full of deſires to finde him; and God (I may ſay) is moſt deſireable to Saints while they are at a loſs for him. Thus the Spouſe ſpeakes (<hi>Cant.</hi> 3.1.) <hi>By night on my bed I ſought him whom my ſoule loveth, I ſought him but I found him not.</hi> But becauſe ſhe found him not, when ſhee ſought him, did ſhee give over ſeeking him? No, her deſires of ſeeking and finding him were enflamed by her not finding him when ſhe ſought him; as it follows in the ſecond verſe; <hi>I will riſe now and goe about the City in the ſtreetes and in the broad wayes, I will ſeeke him whom my ſoule loveth, I ſought him but I found him not.</hi> Thus her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond labour in ſeeking of him was loſt alſo. But doth not this quite diſcourage her, and kill her deſires after him? will ſhe not now give over ſeeking him? No not yet (<hi>ver.</hi> 3.) <hi>The watch-men that goe about the City found me, to whom I ſayd, ſaw ye him whom my ſoule loveth?</hi> Shee is ſtill enquiring and ſeeking, and at laſt ſhee found (<hi>ver.</hi> 4.) <hi>It was but a little that I paſſed from them but I found him, whom my ſoule loveth: I held him and would not let him goe,</hi> &amp;c. Many who enjoy Chriſt have not ſuch ſtrong deſires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him as they who enjoy him not; as it is with other mercies, ſo with this, which is the higheſt and chiefeſt, the ſumme of all mercies, the Enjoyment of God, our deſires to him grow quicker upon his abſence, and wee ſeldome prize his preſence as we ought, till he is departed or withdrawne from us.</p>
                  <p>Againe, we may conſider <hi>Job</hi> here in a very afflicted Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what doth he doe now? <hi>O that I knew where I might finde him!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note, Fourthly;
<q>God is moſt ſweet to an afflicted ſoule.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The preſence of God is ſweet, precious, and delicious to Saints at all times, but then ſweeteſt when they finde moſt bitternes in the world. How pleaſant is the love of God when we are ſencible of mans hatred? Some good men have ſo much ſweetnes and love in the world, that they cannot ſo well reliſh or taſte the ſweetnes of the love of God; though indeed nothing argues the Excellency
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:153845:174"/> of the ſpirit of a Saint, then this,<note place="margin">Extrema cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> that the ſence of the love of God to him, takes off the reliſh of all creature-love, in the midſt of his higheſt Enjoyments of it. That ſoule is purely ſpirituall, which having abundance of worldly enjoyments, riches, friends, relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all that he can deſire, yet in the affluence and higheſt floate of all theſe can ſay, that the ſweetneſſe which he taſteth in God drownes the reliſh of all theſe, and makes them as taſtleſſe as the white of an Egge in compariſon of that ſweetnes which he hath taſted in the goodneſs of God; this is ſpiritualneſs in the very height of it; but uſually God is then ſweeteſt to us when the world is bittereſt to us. <hi>Afflicted ſoules make moſt haſt after God;</hi> and it is well to doe ſo; it is a very ſad ſigne, the worſt Symptome that can appeare upon the ſoules of any, when afflictions draw them off from God, or when they grow cold in their affections towards God, while the love of the world growes cold towards them. The Prophet (<hi>Amos</hi> 6.7.) foreſheweth a very great calamity that ſhould fall upon the people of God; <hi>Thou ſhalt goe Captive with the firſt that goe Captive,</hi> &amp;c. And in the 8 verſe; <hi>The Lord God hath ſworne by himſelfe ſaith the Lord the God of hoſts, I abhorre the Excellency of Jacob, and hate his Palaces</hi> (As if he had ſayd, though I have inveſted him with excellent priviledges, &amp; though he make a great profeſſion of my name, yet becauſe of his provocations and unworthy walkings) <hi>I will deliver up the City and all that is therein,</hi> there's Captivity; then comes Peſtilence in the 9<hi rend="sup">•h</hi> verſe; <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, if ten men remaine in one houſe that they ſhall dye;</hi> and they ſhall not bury them after the ordinary way, but burne them, and the neereſt relations ſhall doe it.

                     </note> Our late Annotators take notice of two other readings. <hi>We have not, or, we will not make mention of the name of the Lord;</hi> Implying that the ſtop lay onely in their owne ſpirits, they being eyther ſo generally wicked, that they had no minde to call upon God, or ſo unbeleeving that they thought their caſe deſperate, and had no hope of help if they ſhould. A Heathen hath ſayd, <hi>That their gods were moſt worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped when moſt diſpleaſed;</hi> but we have ſome Chriſtians in name who will not worſhip God at all when they are under the tokens of his diſpleaſure.

                  <p>Fifthly, (which will further cleare what was laſt obſerved)</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>
                        <hi>That,</hi> The unkindneſſe and trouble which a godly man findeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his friends or others in the world, drives him neerer to God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> beſides the hardſhip he found from ſtrangers, had been hardly uſed by his friends. The uſe which he made of all this, was to make more uſe of or to get neer unto God. <hi>O that I knew where I might finde him.</hi> This was <hi>Davids</hi> wiſdome alſo (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.4, 5.) <hi>I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man would know mee, refuge failed mee, no man cared for my ſoule.</hi> When all ſlighted him, when none tooke care of him; what doth he in this caſe? The next words tell us what; <hi>I cryed unto thee, O Lord, I ſaid thou art my refuge, and my portion in the land of the living.</hi> As if he had ſayd, Upon theſe unkindneſſes, diſreſpects and ſlightings which I found in the world, I tooke occaſion, yea I was ſtirred in my ſpirit to cry unto thee, O Lord, and to ſay, <hi>thou art my refuge,</hi> that is, then I made thee my refuge more then ever. Having made thee my choyce in my beſt times, when men honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and embraced me, I am much encouraged in theſe evill times when men regard me not, and the more becauſe they regard mee not to make thee my refuge, to ſhelter my weather-beaten ſelfe in thy name and power. As the naturall ſpirits in the body, when the aire is very ſharpe, cold, and unkinde to the outward parts, retire inwards, reſort to the heart, keep cloſe to the heart; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in warmer weather the ſpirits are drawne forth, and therefore we are more ſubject to faintings and ſwoonings in hot weather
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:153845:175"/> then in cold; ſo when it is cold weather in the world, when it is as it were froſt and ſnow, ſtorme and tempeſt, then our ſpirituall ſpirits reſort and come in to God, and keep cloſe to him. When we have moſt friends in the world, or when the world is moſt friendly unto us, then God is our beſt friend; his favour is the moſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall and deſireable favour, when we have as much as we can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of favour among men. But when the world hates us and frownes upon us, eſpecially when (as the Prophet ſpeakes of ſome, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.5.) <hi>Our Brethren hate us, and caſt us out for the name ſake of God himſelfe, ſaying, Let the Lord be glorified.</hi> When 'tis thus with us (I ſay) our ſoules are even forced into the preſence of God, to renew our intereſts in his love, and to aſſure our ſoules that we are accepted with him. If under ſuch meaſure from men, we finde not helpe in God, we muſt remaine for ever miſerable. God alone is enough, All without God is nothing to a Godly man. The fullnes of the creature without God cannot ſatisfie him, and the utmoſt want of the creature cannot diſcontent him while he enjoyeth God; the more he wants in the creature, the more he ſeeketh his content in God, and when he findes nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, he cryeth out with greateſt earneſtnes, <hi>O that I knew where I might finde him,</hi> whoſe throane is above, and who is the onely happines of man while he is below.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, We ſee how Inquiſitive <hi>Job</hi> was after God, as he had a deſire and a minde to finde God, ſo he layes about him for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation where and how to finde him.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve;
<q>They who truely deſire to finde God, are diligent in ſearching af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O that I knew</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) where I might finde him!</hi> This was not an Idle wiſh; many are much in the <hi>Optative mood,</hi> full of wiſhings and wouldings; but their wiſhes are altogether wiſhes, and their deſires nothing but deſires; and ſuch deſires are killing deſires; as <hi>Solomon</hi> hath taught us; <hi>The deſire of the ſloathfull kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him</hi> (Prov. 21.25.) an Idle deſire is a death to the deſirer; A godly mans deſires are active deſires, they put him upon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, lead him to the meanes of enjoying the good deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ered. And though God be unexpectedly found of ſome that ſeeke him not, yet no man can expect to finde God, but he that ſeeketh him.
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:153845:176"/> And indeed what ſhould the Creature doe, but be upon an enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry after God? there is a Naturality in it, hee being the ſupream beeing, that we who have our being from him ſhould ſeeke after him. And the Apoſtle tells us (<hi>Act.</hi> 17.26, 27.) that this is the deſigne of God in making of one blood all Nations of men, for to dwel on the face of the earth, and <hi>in determining the times before appoynted, and the bounds of their habitation</hi> (namely) <hi>That they ſhould ſeeke the Lord, if haply they might feel after him and finde him, though he be not farre from every one of us, for in him we live,</hi> &amp;c. The Lord is neer all, he hath a preſence in all places, with all perſons; but the Lord would have all ſeeke, feele, grope after him, even ſuch as have but a dim light of him, as thoſe have that doe not ſeeke ſo much with their eyes as with their hands, they onely feele after the things which they would have. There is a light in the ſpirits of all men, that haply they may feele after God, and finde him; They who have not Scripture light, Goſpel light, the higheſt light, yet have ſome kinde or degree of light; they have ſome glimmerings though no cleare diſcernings; And that ſhould put them on to ſeeke God; much more ſhould they ſeeke after him, who have cleareſt light. And where there is any heate of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to God, a little light will ſerve them to ſeeke after him; <hi>they that are true deſierers will be diligent ſeekers.</hi> And they, who ſeeking God, have found him, will ſeeke him yet againe, yea they will ſeeke him more and more, as long as there is any thing more of God to be found; And there will alwayes be more of God to be found; for here we know God but in part, and therefore have found him but in part: and hence it is that all the Saints in this life, or on this ſide Glory, even they of the higheſt forme and greateſt proficiency in grace and knowledge, are called <hi>Seekers (this is the generation of them that ſeeke him</hi> (Pſal. 24.6.) not ſuch ſeekers (as we finde too many in theſe dayes) who, as if all were upon uncertainties in religion, ſay; they have as yet found nothing; for as there is ſomething wherein the moſt knowing and ſtrongeſt Chriſtians may be to ſeeke, ſo there are many things, yea all things neceſſary to ſalvation, or without which we cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which the weakeſt may finde and know ſufficiently, though not ſully. And as they who deſire to finde theſe things, will be diligent in ſeeking them, ſo they may know in themſelves, or be fully aſſured that they have found them; and ſo even while they
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:153845:176"/> ſtill continue to be ſeekers, know that they are already Finders.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Obſerve;
<q>God is every where, yet eſpecially ſome where to be found.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As there is a finding time, ſo there is a finding place, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meanes; There is a finding time, ſaith holy <hi>David</hi> (Pſal. 32.6.) <hi>For this ſhall every one that is godly pray to thee, in a time when thou mayeſt be found.</hi> The Hebrew is, <hi>in a finding time;</hi> though I would not give any one a ſtop from ſeeking God at any time, yet I muſt ſay there is a ſpeciall <hi>finding time.</hi> And this the Apoſtle calls <hi>the Accepted time</hi> (2 Cor. 6.2.) that is, <hi>the time</hi> which we ought to lay hold upon, or accept, as alſo, <hi>the time,</hi> wherein we ſhall be acceptable or finde acceptation. There is alſo a <hi>finding place,</hi> there is <hi>a where</hi> as well as <hi>a when</hi> God ſpecially is to be found, I mean it not of a meere locality, as if God were now to be found more in one place then in another; for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.8.) <hi>I will that men every where lift up pure hands without wrath and doubting.</hi> And Chriſt told the woman (<hi>Joh.</hi> 4.21.) <hi>The houre cometh when ye ſhall neyther in this Mountaine, nor yet at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem worſhip the father;</hi> not as if Chriſt had forbid the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the father in thoſe places for the time coming; but he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth publick worſhip to all places, or abrogates all differences of place under the Goſpel as to the worſhip of the Father. Yet if any man ſhall enquire, where may I find God, or ſay as <hi>Job</hi> here; <hi>O that I knew where I might finde him!</hi> I would anſwer; Firſt, Seeke him in his promiſes, ſearch the Scriptures, there you will finde God. Secondly, Look for him in his Ordinaces, of prayer and preaching &amp;c. for there he hath promiſed to be preſent; <hi>Where two or three are met together in my name, there am I in the midſt of them</hi> (Math. 18.20.) When the Church or Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles</hi> (Chap. 1.7, 8.) Askes the Queſtion; <hi>Tell me (O thou whom my ſoule loveth) where thou feedeſt? where thou makeſt thy flocks to reſt at Noone?</hi> Chriſt her Beloved, anſwers, <hi>If thou know not (O thou fayreſt among Women) goe thy way forth by the footeſteps of the flocke, and feed thy kids beſides the Sheepherds tents;</hi> That is, follow the holy practices and examples of the Saints in all former ages, which the Apoſtle calls <hi>walking in the ſteps of the faith of Abraham</hi> (Rom. 4.12.) And againe, hearken to the voyce of faithfull Teachers, who as Shepherds feed the flocke of
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:153845:177"/> God with knowledge and underſtanding. Waite at theſe Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds tents (ſaith Chriſt) and there thou ſhalt finde a preſence of God with thee, and his bleſſing upon thee.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, And above all, <hi>Seeke God in Chriſt;</hi> The father is onely to be found in the Sonne; Looke to Jeſus Chriſt, and in him you cannot but behold God; for he is <hi>the brightnes of his glory, and the expreſſe image of his perſon</hi> (Heb. 1.3.) and therefore as he that hath the Son hath the Father alſo, ſo he that (by an eye of faith, and in the light of the Word and Spirit) Beholdeth the Son beholdeth the Father alſo. <hi>For the light of the knowledge of the glory of God is given us in the face of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (2 Cor. 4.6.) The light of the knowledge of the goodneſſe of God, of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Juſtice, holines (which are his glory) ſhineth forth from Jeſus Chriſt; that is, in and by Chriſt it appeares gloriouſly, that God is exceeding good, mercifull, juſt, &amp; holy. Therefore to every wearied ſoule complaining of the loſſe of God, and crying out, <hi>O that I knew where I might finde him!</hi> The ſumme of all the Counſell that I can give, or indeed that can be given is this; Seek God in Chriſt, and he will be found. <hi>O that I knew where I might finde him,</hi>
                     <q>That I might come even to his ſeat.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some conceive theſe words as the iſſue of a diſtemperd ſpirit: others tax <hi>Job</hi> with too much boldnes, that he being but duſt and aſhes ſhould thus preſſe upon God, and that he was afterwards reproved for it in the 38<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of this Booke, verſe the firſt and ſecond; <hi>Then the Lord anſwered Job out of the whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde and ſaid</hi> (there he found him) <hi>who is this that darkeneth Councell by words without knowledge, gird up now thy loynes like a man, for I will demand of thee, and anſwer thou me.</hi> And againe, in the 40<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap. <hi>ver.</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, <hi>Shall he that Contendeth with the Almighty inſtruct him, he that reproveth God let him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it. Then Job anſwered the Lord and ſaid; Behold I am vile, I will lay my hand upon my mouth. Once have I ſpoken, but I will not anſwer, yea twice, but I will proceed no further,</hi> As if he had acknowledged his error and overboldnes in preſſing upon God; as in other places, ſo alſo in this; <hi>O that I might come even to his ſeate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet I conceive that <hi>Job</hi> in this paſſage, doth but put forth the nobler and higher actings of his faith, and that he ſpeaks this,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:153845:177"/> not as forgetting the diſtance of duſt and aſhes, from the glory of God, or from the glorious God, but as remembring the promiſe, and as inſiſting upon his priviledge as a beleever who is invited to come, and to come with boldnes to the throane of Grace. For though that promiſe was not given out as to the formality of it in thoſe times, yet the vertue of it was, though in a lower degree then now.

In purſuance whereof it is well conceived by a learned enterpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that there is a metonymie, in the word which ſignifies <hi>a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared ſeate,</hi> that is, ſuch a ſeate as whereon God preſents himſelfe to poore ſinners, prepared and ready to give them both admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to himſelfe and a gratious audience of their requeſts and ſuites. The word which wee tranſlate <hi>ſeate,</hi> ſignifieth <hi>a prepared place, a place fitted,</hi> implying ſomewhat ſpeciall and peculiar unto God. Heaven is called <hi>the habitation of his holines and of his glory (Eſay</hi> 63.15.) yet whereſoever the Lord is, hee makes it a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Thus alſo he can make any place where he is a hell. <hi>The wicked ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting fire from the preſence of the Lord,</hi> (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.9.) that is, the very preſence of the Lord ſhall be a hell and torment to them. The Lord can be both terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and gratious in his preſence any where; yet he is ſomewhere more gratiouſly, ſome where more terribly preſent. Some can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beare thoſe expreſſions, <hi>The Throne of God, the ſeat of God, heaven, and hell.</hi> As if theſe were but the Imaginations, fancies and fictions of mans braine. But the Lord hath his ſeates and dwelling places, whence and where he declares himſelfe, both in mercy and in judgement, both in his holines and in his glory. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.1.) <hi>I ſaw alſo the Lord ſitting upon his Throne, high and lifted up.</hi> Thus the Lord manifeſted himſelfe in viſion to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; and <hi>David</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>Thy Throne O God is for ever and ever</hi> (Pſal 45.6.) that is, thy Power and Soveraigntie. <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes not of a material Throne ſuch as Kings have; the Power and Soveraignty of God are his throne whereſoever he is, and is pleaſed to declare himſelfe in his ſoveraignty and power. So that when <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>O that I might come even to his ſeate or throane,</hi> the meaning is, O that I might come as neer him as poſſibly I may,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:153845:178"/> I would not ſtand at a diſtance, or keepe aloofe off, as a guilty malefactor, but draw neere to him in a holy and well-grounded confidence. Thus <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes in anſwer to that Charge of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> in the former Chapter, <hi>Is not thy wickednes great, and thine iniquities infinite?</hi> Now (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) you ſhall ſee what my ſinnes are, and what my guilt, ſeing I dare venture even to the very throne of God, where no hypocrite dares appeare. While <hi>Job</hi> profeſſeth, That if God after the manner of men ſhould ſit in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Judgement (there will be ſuch a Judgement at the laſt day) he would come neer to him, and not be afraid, he ſeemes fully aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of his owne integrity, or of the goodnes of his cauſe, as alſo that God would be good unto him.</p>

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:153845:178"/> wicked practice which they had bound up in their hearts, and ſaid, none ſhall know it, he ſcatters and diſcovers. <hi>Solomons</hi> proverb carryes an experienced truth in it both wayes. And we may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from it, That if an earthly King or Magiſtrate, <hi>ſitting on the Throne, ſcattereth all evill with his eyes, how much more doth God?</hi> neither any evill matter, nor any evill man can ſtand before him. And ſeing the Lord diſcovers all the evill that is in the hearts and wayes of men, what can give perfect boldnes in comming to the Throne of God, but onely an Intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, in whom the throane of God is become a Throane of grace to ſinners? Were it onely a Throne of Judgement and Juſtice, <hi>no fleſh could ſtand before it,</hi> but being a Throne of grace, the worſt of ſinners, who wait for grace, may come neer, and the neerer they come the welcomer they are. A godly man is never better then when he is neer God, and then thinks himſelfe beſt when he is neereſt unto God; all his happines in this life and his glory in that which is to come, doth conſiſt in his nearenes unto God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whereas <hi>Job</hi> ſaith; <hi>O that I might come even to his Seat.</hi> Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>A Godly man is willing that God ſhould Judge both his Perſon and his Cauſe.</q>
                  <p>That's the deſigne of <hi>Job,</hi> he had appealed from the Judgement of his friends, and begd the Judgement of God; He was reſolute in it, to ſtand or fall according to his ſentence. But why was <hi>Job</hi> ſo deſirerous of the Judgement of God? why would he goe to his Throne, and appeale to him? When men make appeales from one Throne to another, they have their reaſons for it; When <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>I appeale to Caeſar</hi> (Act. 25.11.) doubtleſs he was fully perſwaded that he ſhould find better termes with <hi>Caeſar</hi> then among the <hi>Jews;</hi> So when <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, I appeale to God (which is the higheſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale, and beyond which there lyes no appeale) doubtleſſe <hi>Job</hi> was fully perſwaded that he ſhould finde better termes at Gods tribunal, then he had found among his friends. And <hi>Job</hi> might have many grounds of better termes from God. For</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God is wiſe, even a God of Judgement, who would not receive Judgement from a wiſe and underſtanding Judge, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from him who is wiſdome and underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God is Omniſcient; there are many wiſe Judges,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:153845:179"/> but no Omniſcient Judges in the world. Princes are ſaid to have long hands, and very cleare eyes, they can reach farre, and ſee farre, but they cannot ſee all; but God is able to Judge the ſecrets of all hearts, for he ſees all ſecrets, and knowes what man cannot. For that reaſon a godly man loves the Judgement of God, becauſe he knowes his heart; And for the ſame reaſon wicked men, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites eſpecially, are afraid of the Judgement of God: they know if their outward actons ſhould come to be ſcan'd, much more if their hearts ſhould be turn'd outward, it muſt needs goe ill with them. Moſt hypocrites carry it faire onely for a while before the world, they at laſt diſcover themſelves, the diſeaſe breaks out at their fingers ends, or at their tongues end; Their words or works diſcover the rottennes of their hearts, and the formality of their profeſſion. But ſome hypocrites carry it fayre to the world all their dayes, and feare not the Judgement of men, yet even then a thought of the Judgement of God is dreadfull to them, whereas the Saints, even all who are ſincere, deſire God to Judge them; for indeed their hearts are better then their wayes, and their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections then their actions, and they know that God diſcernes with what heart and ſpirit every thing is done, as well as what is done. He doth not Judge by appearances (as we ought not, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.24.) and therefore his is a righteous Judgement. God doth not judge things as they appeare, but as they are, unleſſe they are as they appeare, and whatſoever their appearance is, he can judge them as they are. He can judge by diſcerning what is in the deepe, and follow a matter to the very ſpring of it; therefore I'le goe to God (ſaith the upright heart) my deſire is that he ſhould Judge my cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Lord is a gratious and a mercifull Judge; he is as full of pity as he is of wiſdome, and as ready to relieve as he is quick-ſighted to diſcerne.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Lord is very patient; Firſt, patient to heare; and ſecondly, patient to beare. Patience to heare is a great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement; many Judges are weary of the worke, they will not heare a poore man out, but God will; and God is patient alſo to beare with and paſſe by the faylings of his people, whoſe upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes he knowes.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, A Godly man knowes that God his Judge hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an atonement, that <hi>he is made for him,</hi> and upon grounds of
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:153845:179"/> Juſtice and righteouſneſſe is become his friend. Some who have bad Cauſes, yet come up to the Throne of man boldly, becauſe they know the Judge is <hi>made for them</hi> by a bride, and ſo will give ſentence on their ſide, be it right or wrong. Saints know that the Judge is <hi>made for them,</hi> but made in a holy manner, not with baſe bribery to blinde his eyes to pervert juſtice, but he hath received an atonement, he is appeas'd and ſatisfied by a Mediator at his owne appointment. If God ſhould ſearch the beſt of Saints nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly, they muſt needs fall in judgement, yet they know they ſhall ſtand in judgement, becauſe the Judge is reconciled to them by Chriſt; yea Chriſt who made the Atonement, and is the reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, is the Judge, this encourageth Saints to come to God; <hi>For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled we ſhall be ſaved by his life</hi> (Rom. 5.10.) The caſe ſtanding thus with beleevers, who ſeeth not ground for their appeale from the judgement, eyther of open ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or (as <hi>Job</hi> did) miſtaken Friends; <hi>O that I might come even to his Seate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the two next verſes, <hi>Job</hi> tells us what he would doe if his appeale were granted and himſelfe admitted to the ſeate of God.</p>

This is a fayre ſence, onely it ſtraitens the Text; For we may ſuppoſe <hi>Job</hi> in this addreſſe and application to God ready to heare whatſoever God ſhould ſay unto him, whether his were words of approbation or reproof, whether for him or againſt him. Though <hi>Job</hi> had (doubtleſſe) a ſtrong confidence, that God would approve of him and give ſentence on his ſide, yet conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his owne weakneſſes and diſtempers of minde, he might well conceive that ſome things had fallen from him or been done by him which might deſerve and call for chidings and rebukes, as the iſſue indeed was. And therefore it was moſt congruous that he ſhould preſent himſelfe before the Lord in a frame of heart to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive reprehenſions as well as conſolations. <hi>I would know the words that he would anſwer me and underſtand</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Knowing, and underſtanding,</hi> may be taken here two wayes; Firſt, for Conſidering and weighing what God would ſay, or what Award he would make; In which he ſeemes cloſely to checke his friends, who thought him ſo dull and incapable, that ſurely he did not apprehend nor underſtand their anſwers. Well (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) whatſoever you thinke of my dulnes to underſtand your anſwers, or what you have ſayd, yet I doubt not but I ſhall underſtand the anſwers of God, or what he ſhall ſay unto mee.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They note a reverence and reſpect to the word of God; <hi>I would know the words that he would anſwer;</hi> that is, ſubmit to them, I would not oppoſe the Judgement or Opinion of God concerning me. Though <hi>Job</hi> did not ſit downe or acquieſſe in the judgement of his friends, yet he would reverence and ſit downe quietly in the judgement of God, &amp; in the anſwer which he ſhould pleaſe to give. In eyther of theſe interpretations, the ſence is good. <hi>I would know;</hi> that is, I would ſtudy to finde out the minde of God, and underſtand what he ſaith to mee, and then reverently ſubmit thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Further, This forme of ſpeaking, <hi>I would know the words, and I would underſtand</hi> &amp;c. ſeemeth to imply a vehement deſire in <hi>Job</hi>
                     <pb n="335" facs="tcp:153845:181"/> to know the minde of God concerning him. As a man that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed longs to heare the minde of the Judge, as for others 'tis not much to him what they ſay for him or againſt him. As <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake in a like caſe (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3.) <hi>With me it is a very ſmall thing to be judged of you, or of mans judgement</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he that judgeth me is the Lord;</hi> that is, to his judgement I muſt ſtand; He is above all.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That a godly man is carefull to underſtand the anſwer and determinations of God concerning him.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I would know the words that he would anſwer mee,</hi> and this not onely (according to the ſuppoſition which <hi>Job</hi> makes here) if God ſhould ſpeake to him perſonally, or mouth to mouth; but in what way ſoever God ſhould ſpeake to him. It is the great care of a Godly man to know the word of God written and deliver'd over to us, as the rule of our life and faith; for indeed therein wee have our judgement, and our anſwer: as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>the words that I ſpeake, they ſhall judge you at the laſt day;</hi> that is, by the word you ſhall be judged. Likewiſe it is the care of a Godly man to underſtand what God ſpeakes to him by his workes and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, by his rods and chaſtnings. In theſe the Lord ſpeakes to us and gives us anſwers. They who are wiſe, will ſtudy to know and underſtand them. We may conceive that <hi>Job</hi> had reſpect to two things eſpecially, about which he deſiered that he might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the anſwer, and words of God to him.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That God would ſhew him the true Cauſe of his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for he did not take that to be the Cauſe which his friends had ſo often ſuggeſted, and ſo diſputed upon that <hi>Fallacy</hi> all along, which Logicians call, <hi>The putting of that for a Cauſe which is not the Cauſe.</hi> Therefore <hi>Job</hi> hoped to know of God what he would ſay, as to the reaſon why he did Contend with him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What God would ſay to him by way of Direction and Councell, by way of remedy and redreſs, he was ſollicitous to underſtand the minde of God, and what God expected from him under this diſpenſation. So that <hi>Jobs</hi> ſcope was not at all (as <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> ſuſpected) to plead his owne righteouſneſſe and holy walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings before God, as if God had been beholding to him for them, and ſo muſt needs grant him (as having deſerved it) whatſoever he ſhould aske. But that he might be acquainted with the holy

As alſo (and that principally) that he might heare from his Majeſty which was the great poynt in controverſie between him and his friends) whether he did correct and chaſten him as a ſon, or puniſh and take vengeance on him, as on a rebell; and ſo ſet him among the examples of caution for ſinners in time to come.</p>

                     <hi>Job</hi> would not reſt in his friends judgement, but in Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he would reſt, and enquire no further; I (ſaith he) freely yeeld up my ſelfe to that; if the Lord ſhould pronounce mee In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, I would reſt in his ſentence, and be thankfull; if the Lord ſhould pronounce mee faulty, yet I would reſt in his ſentence, and be patient; yea then I would aske mercy and begg his grace for the pardon of my faylings. God is an Infallible Judge, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no man ought to queſtion his determinations; Indeed, <hi>Every mouth ſhall be ſtopped, and all the world become guilty before God</hi> (Rom. 3.19.) that is, acknowledg the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves guilty before him when he judgeth. And as there is no avoyding the judgement of God, ſo a godly man deſires to rejoyce in it. <hi>Good is the word of the Lord,</hi> ſayd <hi>Hezekiah</hi> (2 King. 20 19.) When a very ſore ſentence was paſt againſt him, <hi>and he ſayd, is it not Good? if peace and truth be in my dayes?</hi> By <hi>good</hi> in the former part of the verſe, he meanes juſt and equall; as if he had ſayd, though this word be full of gall and wormewood, yet it is no other then I and my people have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and drawne upon our ſelves: By <hi>good</hi> in the latter part of the verſe, he meanes Gracious and mercifull; as if he had ſayd, God in this ſentence hath mixed the <hi>good</hi> of juſtice and equity, with the <hi>good</hi> of graciouſnes and mercy, or in the midſt of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he hath remembred mercy. Thus alſo when God gave ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence by fire againſt the two ſons of <hi>Aaron; Moſes ſayd to Aaron; This is that the Lord ſpake, ſaying, I will be ſanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified</hi> (Lev. 10.3.) Now, when <hi>Aaron</hi> heard this, the text ſaith; <hi>And Aaron held his peace.</hi> He murmured not, he contradicted not, but reſted pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently in the judgement of God. And thus <hi>Job</hi> was reſolved to
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:153845:182"/> give himſelfe up to the judgement of God whatſoever it ſhould be. And we ſhall finde him (in the next words) hoping ſtrongly to finde God very ſweete and gratious to him, could he but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a hearing at his <hi>Judgement ſeate.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve;
<q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> God hath great power, much power, All power is his.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The power of men and Angels is his; What power ſoever, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for kinde or degree, is in the hand of any creature, that power belongs to God. Thus <hi>David,</hi> a man of Great power ſtates it, <hi>God hath ſpoken once, twice have I heard this, That power belongeth unto God.</hi> The power that is ſcattered and divided all the world over is centred and united in him. God hath a greatneſſe of power, in commanding and diſpoſing what and how things ſhall be done, he alſo hath a greatnes of power in doing and executing what he hath commanded. The commands of men are often unperformed, eyther becauſe they to whom their commands are ſent have no power to performe them, or becauſe they want power to backe their owne commands. Wee may conſider the Greatnes of the power of God ſeveral wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As he can doe all things, and is omnipotent, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too hard for him, his hand is not ſhortened in reference to the longeſt or the greateſt workes, and difficulties. And as he can doe whatſoever he hath a will to doe, ſo he will doe whatſoever he pleaſeth to have done, whatſoever he purpoſeth to doe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is upon his heart to doe: none of his counſells ever fayled, nor have any of the thoughts of his heart been fruſtrated. Men often purpoſe to doe, but they ſeldome have power to doe what they have purpoſed; they are bigge with the conceptions of many great matters, but when the children come to the birth, they have no ſtrength to bring forth. God never failes in his power to doe whatſoever he hath a purpoſe or a mind to doe, God hath power enough to backe his commands, and he can ſupply power to thoſe whom he calleth to execute them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The greatneſſe of Gods power is ſeene in this; that
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:153845:184"/> He hath a right to doe all that he doth. As he hath a fullneſſe of ſtrength, ſo a fulneſſe of Authority; he doth not uſurp or intrench upon any other power in what he doth, nor upon any mans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in what he hath; it is his due to doe what he doth, and to have what he hath. God is ſupream, giving the Law to all, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Law from none; his is not a tyrannicall, but a juſt and a righteous power; his is not a might without right, but a might with right. What the Prophet ſpeakes of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> (Hab. 1.7.) is true of God in every ſence, in the ſtricteſt ſence; <hi>His judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and his dignity proceedeth of himſelfe;</hi> he is a law unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, his rule is internall, and his power intrinſecall. All derive power from him, therefore his power is altogether underived. Power underived muſt needs be great power, yea the Greatnes of power.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The greatneſſe of his power appeareth further in this, <hi>that no man may preſume to queſtion him for what he doth.</hi> He hath great power in what he doth, whom none may ſo much as aske what doeſt thou? <hi>Nebucadnezzar</hi> (a heathen in higheſt earthly power) confeſſeth as much of the power of God, as ſoone as he regained the reaſon of a man (<hi>Dan.</hi> 4.34, 35.) <hi>At the end of the dayes</hi> (that is, after the terme of ſeven yeares was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, when for the heart of a beaſt a mans heart was reſtored to him) <hi>I Nebuchadnezzar lift up mine eyes to heaven, and mine underſtanding returned unto me, and I bleſſed the moſt high, and I praiſed and honoured him that liveth for ever, whoſe dominion is an everlaſting dominion, and his kingdome is from generation to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing, and he doth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth, and none can ſtay his hand, or ſay unto him, what doſt thou?</hi> that is, none may ſo much as queſtion, much leſſe reprove him for any thing that he doth. Though there are many who in the pride of their hearts, and through the forgetfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their duty, will preſume to queſtion God about what he hath done, and even controule his doings; yet of right or accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to rule, none can. Hence the Apoſtle having aſſerted the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of God, <hi>he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth,</hi> brings in ſome queſtioning his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; but he checks them ſoundly for their boldnes in queſtioning, and inſtructs them by many upbrayding queſtions, that they ought
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:153845:184"/> not to put that or any ſuch queſtion. <hi>Thou wilt ſay then</hi> (ver. 18, 19, 20.) <hi>why doth he yet finde fault, for who hath reſiſted his will? nay but who art thou ô man, that replieſt againſt God, ſhall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, why haſt thou made me thus? hath not the potter power over the clay, of the ſame lumpe to make one veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of honour, and another of diſhonour?</hi> what if God were willing to ſhew his wrath in ſome, as well as his grace &amp; mercy in others, what have you or I to doe with it? who gave you or I leave to examine God upon intergatoryes about it? Thus he pleads the power or prerogative of God, this muſt ſilence all our queries, and ſatisfie all our doubts; none may aske him a reaſon of what he doth; the reaſon is in himſelfe. The will of God is his reaſon; and there is all the reaſon in the world it ſhould; for his is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſoveraigne will, but a juſt and a holy will. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith (<hi>Eccl.</hi> 8.4. <hi>Where the word of a king is, there is power, and who may ſay unto him, what doſt thou?</hi> In all lawfull adminiſtrations, it is true of kings and ſupream earthly powers, in what forme ſoever, none may ſay unto them what doe yee? their word muſt ſtand: much more is this true of him who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, who is the ſupream power of heaven and earth; all whoſe wayes are equall, and his diſpenſations righteous, though we ſee not the equity and righteouſneſſe of them. That, is not onely great, but the greateſt power, which <hi>none may queſtion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, This alſo demonſtrates the greatneſſe of Gods power, that none can ſtop or hinder him in what it hath a minde to doe: what he appoints he executes, and none can ſtop it, or as (<hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> ſpeakes in the place before mentioned, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.35.) <hi>ſtay his hand.</hi> The hand of the ſtrongeſt power upon the earth may be, and hath been ſtaid; kings have had a check, their hands have been ſtayd, but none can ſtay the hand of God; <hi>I will worke</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and none ſhall let it</hi> (Iſa. 43.17.) God ſhould doe but little worke in the world, if men could let it. Wicked men would let or hinder God in all his workes, and the godly (through their miſtakes) would hinder him in ſome of his workes; but none can; <hi>He ſpeaks to the Sunne and it ſhineth not, yea he ſpeakes to the Sunne and it moveth not.</hi> This is the greatneſſe and the muchnes of the power of God.</p>
                  <p>But, ſaith <hi>Job, Will he plead againſt me with this great power?</hi> All this power God hath (and this power he can put forth) but he
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:153845:185"/> will not put it forth againſt me (ſaith <hi>Job</hi> 1.) And what was <hi>Job</hi> that he ſhould be thus confident, and riſe up to ſuch a ſtrong aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that God would not uſe his ſtrength againſt him? <hi>Job</hi> was a godly man, a man fearing God, a man perfect and upright, a man full of faith, even full of faith (though he lived in dark times, and under dark diſpenſations, yet, I ſay, he was a man full of faith) in the Redeemer. Now it is no wonder if a man of this character, a man thus qualified and priviledged had this confidence, and was much aſſured that he ſhould proſper and ſpeed in it, <hi>That God would not plead againſt him with his great power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve;
<q>A godly man may be confident that God will deale gently and graciouſly with him. or,</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That God will deale with him according to the greatnes of his mercy, not according to the greatnes of his power; The greatnes of the power of God is an exceeding great comfort to the ſincere, becauſe they know it is acted towards them in the greatnes of his mercy. It is comfortable to heare that the Lord, who (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet deſcribes him, <hi>Nah:</hi> 1.3.) <hi>is great in power, is alſo ſlow to anger</hi> (the greatnes of mans power doth uſually quicken not clogg his paſſions) but it is more comfortable to know, that God who is great in power, is quick and ſpeedy to ſhew mercy. And hence it is that a true beleever rejoyceth in the power o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> God as well as in his mercy, becauſe he knoweth that God hath declared himſelfe powerfull for him, as well as mercifull. He knoweth God will not put forth power alone, or nothing but power towards him. God doth exerciſe all his refreſhing attributes, and divine perfections, in dealing with Saints Whereas upon the wicked he exerciſeth his power chiefely, though not onely. <hi>What if God to make his power knowne endured with much long-ſuffering the veſſels of wrath fitted for deſtruction,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle (<hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22.) God pleads with the wicked according to the tenour of the Covenant of workes, but with Beleevers according to the Covenant of grace, in which he doth as it were uncloath himſelfe of his power, and cloath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with love, mercy, goodneſſe, and tendernes to his people. <hi>The Lord</hi> (as the Pſalmiſt ſpeakes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 93.1.) <hi>is cloathed with ſtrength, wherewith he hath girded himſelfe,</hi> he is cloathed alſo with mercy, and with that he hath girded himſelfe; he pleads with his
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:153845:185"/> people (I grant) in righteouſneſſe, as well as in mercy (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes (<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25, 26.) <hi>God hath ſet forth Jeſus Christ, to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for the remiſſion</hi> (or <hi>paſſing over) of ſins that are paſt through the forbearance of God, to declare I ſay at this time his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and the juſtifyer of him that beleeveth in Jeſus.</hi> The juſtice or righteouſneſſe of God was never ſo fully declared as in Chriſt; for God did not ſpare him at all, but he having taken our debt upon him, diſcharged it to the utmoſt farthing. God pleaded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt with his great power, and with his perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; To which plea Chriſt made anſwer with as Great a power (his being the power of God) and with as perfect a righteouſnes, his being alſo the righteouſneſſe of God. And hence it is, that when God comes to plead with Beleevers, he pleads not againſt them with his power and righteouſneſſe, ſeing Chriſt with both pleads for them; He pleads for them not onely as he is Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, but as he is the mighty, the All-powerfull God. This is the chiefeſt ground of a beleevers confidence, that God (as <hi>Job</hi> here ſaith) will not plead againſt him with his great power. What then did <hi>Job</hi> beleeve would God doe with him? the next words enforme us what his faith was in that particular.</p>
                  <q>But he would put ſtrength in mee.</q>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> A beleiver hath no opinion of his owne ſtrength, or that he can doe any thing in his owne ſtrength.</q>
                  <p>He truſts no more to his owne ſtrength or power, then to his owne righteouſneſſe or worthineſſe. As our Juſtification before God is purely founded in the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, ſo all the actings of our ſanctification are maintained by the ſtrength of
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:153845:186"/> Chriſt. Holy <hi>Job</hi> ſpake nothing of his owne ſtrength, yea he ſpake as having no ſtrength of his owne. A Godly man knows his owne ſtrength is but weakneſſe, and that when he prevailes with God it is with a power which he hath from God. <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth a forme of ſpeech which we may call <hi>a divine riddle</hi> (2 Cor. 12.10.) <hi>When I am weake then I am ſtrong,</hi> he predicates or affirmes one contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of another, weakneſſe is contrary to ſtrength, how a weake man ſhould be ſtrong, and then eſpecially ſtrong when he is weake, is hard to conceive by thoſe who are ſpirituall, and is unconceivable by thoſe who are carnal. This aſſertion is enough to poſe and puzle nature; <hi>He that is weake is ſtrong,</hi> or <hi>the readieſt way to get ſtrength is to be weake.</hi> The truth and the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning is plainly this; <hi>When I am weake in my owne ſenſe and opinion, when I am convinced that I have no power of my owne, then I feele power coming in, then Chriſt ſtrengthens me, and I am ſtrong,</hi> then I experience that word, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> When I finde the waters of my owne ciſterne low and fayling, then I have a ſupply from the Spirit. So the Apoſtle ſpake, (<hi>Phil.</hi> 1.19.) <hi>I know that this alſo ſhall turne to my ſalvation through your prayers, and the ſupply of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all his ſtrength at once, we now receive our ſtrength by dayly freſh ſupplyes from the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi> The word there uſed by the Apoſtle, which we render <hi>ſupply,</hi> ſignifieth an <hi>under-ſupply,</hi> implying thus much, that as the naturall body and each particular member of it, is ſupplyed with ſence and motion, together with a ſuitable ſtrength and ability from the head, ſo beleevers who are altogether the myſticall body of Chriſt, and each of them mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in particular, are ſupplyed from Chriſt their head by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, with ſpirituall life, motion, and ſtrength of Grace for every duty to which they are called, or which is required of them. And becauſe as this is ſo in its ſelfe, ſo beleevers are inſtructed in it; therfore they diſclaime and goe out of their own ſtrength, that <hi>the power of Chriſt may reſt upon them.</hi> Chriſt fills none but the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, nor doth he ſtrengthen any but the weake. <hi>They who thinke they have any thing of their owne, ſhall receive nothing from him; unleſſe Chriſt be all in all to us, he will not be any thing at all to us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve;
<q>God himſelfe puts ſtrength into humbled ſinners, that they may ſtand before him.</q>
                     <pb n="346" facs="tcp:153845:187"/> As he knows what ſtrength ſuch need, ſo he gives them the ſtreng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h they need; <hi>He will put ſtrength in me,</hi> maybe the confidence of any ſoule in <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe. We are not able to ſtand before God under the burden of our corruptions, nor yet are we able to walke before him under the burden of our duties, unleſſe himſelfe be pleaſed to adminiſter ſtrength to us. And ſurely if we have cauſe even to glory in our infirmities, that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon us (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9.) then much more have we cauſe to glory in the power of Chriſt, when we finde ſo many infirmities reſting in us. The Prophet ſaw this fully while he ſaid (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.24.) <hi>Surely ſhall one ſay in the Lord have I righteouſneſſe and ſtrength, even to him ſhall men come, in the Lord ſhall all the ſeed of Iſraell be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ſhall glory.</hi> That we have ſtrength in and from the Lord, is to us a ground of holy Glorying as wel as that we have righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe in him. For though to be juſtified be a higher favour then to be ſtrengthned, yet unleſſe we were ſtrengthned, as we could not take in the comfort of our Juſtification freely, ſo neyther could we give God the glory of it ſo fully as we ought. And as it is the joy of beleevers that God will put ſtrength into them when they are humbled under the greateſt weakneſſes, ſo that their ſtrength is ſtill in him. For God doth not ſo put it into us, as to put that ſtrength out of himſelfe. The ſtrength which God puts into us is a ſtrength ſtill reſiding in himſelfe. The ſtrength which we have received, as well as that which we have not yet received, is ſtill in the hand of God. And from his hand we ſhall receive renewalls of ſtrength for all our needs and purpoſes. Take five inſtances in ſpeciall.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A Believer ſhall receive ſtrength to doe, or an acting power from Chriſt; Though Chriſt hath done all for us, yet we have much to doe for Chriſt, and (ſuch is the myſtery of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) that the ſame Chriſt who hath done all for us, will alſo doe all in us. Chriſt layeth a yoak upon the necks of his people, and a burden upon their ſhoulders, but he puts power and ſtrength into their ſhoulders to carry his yoak and beare his burden; and that's the reaſon why he calls his <hi>yoake eaſie, and his burthen light,</hi> it is not ſo conſidered in it ſelfe, as if we could make light worke of the worke of Chriſt; but his burden is light, becauſe he hath promiſed to give his at leaſt a ſufficient ſtrength to bear it. A heavy burthen is not grievous to equal ſtrength, &amp; it is light to a ſuperior
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:153845:187"/> or greater ſtrength. As all our ſins (the leaſt whereof is a burden too heavy for us to beare) are light to us through the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt, ſo all the commandements of God (the leaſt of which is too hard for us alone) are light to us through the ſtrength of Chriſt. This was the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> profeſſion, <hi>I can doe all things through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth me,</hi> (Phil. 4.13.) A little is too much for us, all is but little for Chriſt; as we have the anointing of the Spirit, whereby we know all things, (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.20.) ſo we have the ſtrengthening of the Spirit, whereby we doe all things It is a high priviledge, that Saints who receive their worke from heaven, receive their ſtrength from heaven too. And that as God puts his commands upon them, ſo he puts this power into them. The Lord is ſo farre from requiring worke of us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving us wages for what we have done, that he doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire worke of us without giving us ſtrength to doe it. When we looke upon our reward it might ſeeme that we have done all our ſelves, but when we looke upon his aſſiſtance, it is as evident that we have done nothing of our ſelves. The Lord is not like thoſe <hi>Aegyptian</hi> task-maſters who called for brick, but would not give ſtraw; no, the Lord who calls for brick, doth not onely give us ſtraw, but ſtrength, even hands, and hearts to doe our worke. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-grace or new-Covenant-grace promiſeth us ſtrength to doe what we are commanded to doe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Lord gives us, as ſtrength to doe, ſo to ſuffer, ſtrength to beare his croſſe as well as his yoake: ſo the Apoſtle comforts the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (1 Ep: 10.13.) <hi>No temptation</hi> (that is, no affliction, for as every temptation hath trouble in it, and is therefore juſtly called an affliction, ſo every affliction hath a try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in it, and is therefore juſtly called a temptation, in which ſence the Apoſtle there ſaith, <hi>no temptation) hath taken hold of you, but that which is common to man, but God is faithfull that will not ſuffer you to be tempted above what ye are able, but with the temptation will make a way of eſcape, that ye may be able to beare it.</hi> As if he had ſayd; be not afrayd that you ſhall be oppreſſed with the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of any affliction or temptation which ye endure in my cauſe or for my name ſake; for ye ſhall receive an ability commenſara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to your affliction, whatſoever it is; you ſhall be ſupported in thoſe afflictions which are immediately from the hand of God, much more in thoſe which are from the hand of man, even in the
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:153845:188"/> extreameſt and hotteſt perſecutions. <hi>Paul</hi> had experience of this (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.17.) There he tells a ſad ſtory of the fearefullneſſe if not of the unfaithfullnes of men, even of good men to him in an evill day, and he tells as comfortable a ſtory of the preſence and faithfullneſſe of God to him in an evill day, even in the worſt and blackeſt day that this world could lowre upon him in. <hi>At my firſt anſwer, no man ſtood with me</hi> (that is, no man appeared to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, to comfort me) <hi>all men forſooke me, I pray God it be not laid to their charge,</hi> (What then? was he left of all, becauſe left of all men, no ſuch matter, All men left him, but God who is but one One-moſt God, and who alone is more then all men abode by him, as it followes in the Text) <hi>notwithſtanding the Lord ſtood with me and ſtrengthned me, that by me the preaching might be fully knowne, and that all the Gentiles might heare: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the Lyon;</hi> that is, out of the danger of my dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſecuters, even out of the danger of <hi>Nero</hi> himſelfe, by whoſe power ſo many had been deſtroyed. The Lord alwayes ſtands by his in time of affliction and tryall, eyther to ſtrengthen them in it, or to ſtrengthen them out of it, that is, to eſcape it; eyther to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them from the danger of it, or to encourage them in the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Lord puts ſtrength into his people to mortifie corruption, he gives us not onely power againſt, but power over our luſts. Fleſhly luſts and corruptions are ſtrong, and if we have not ſtrength from Chriſt to ſubdue and conquer them, they will be too hard for us, and foyle us. We are eaſily and preſently foiled, by pride, by covetouſneſſe, by wrath, by envie, all theſe paſſions and luſts will trample us under their feete in the dirt of all ſinfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and pollution both of fleſh and ſpirit, unleſſe we receive power from on high to ſubdue and mortifie them. (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13.) <hi>If ye through the Spirit mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live;</hi> that is, ye ſhall live comfortably, holyly, and eternally. <hi>The deeds of the body,</hi> that is, ſinfull deeds, and the roote of them ſinfull luſts, count all weapons (as Leviathan doth ſpeares and ſwords) but <hi>ſtraw and ſtubble,</hi> rather to be laughed at then feared, except one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the weapons or power of the Spirit. And when once we take our luſts to taske with the weapons of the Spirit, they preſently fall and dye before us. <hi>The Spirit is the ſtrength of God in us for the mortification of Corruption.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="349" facs="tcp:153845:188"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, We are ſtrengthened, or God puts ſtrength into us for the reſiſting and conquering of the temptations of Satan; we meet with many aſſaults from the devill, and from the world, who are confederate with our luſts. Theſe we muſt <hi>reſiſt ſtedfaſt in the faith;</hi> and that not onely in <hi>the faith</hi> as <hi>the faith</hi> imports ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of doctrine or divine truth, but as <hi>The faith</hi> imports depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon Chriſt for ſtrength and aſſiſtance. <hi>Peter,</hi> being <hi>a cheife, a grandee</hi> in the traine of Chriſt, or among the Diſciples of Chriſt, was Satans eye-ſore, and the fayrer marke for his fiery darts; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans fingers itcht to be doing with him, he (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>deſired to have him that he might ſift him as wheat</hi> (Luk. 22.31.) that is, to ſift him throughly, not to fetch out his chaffe from him, but indeed to make him chaffe. How was <hi>Peter</hi> upheld? <hi>I have prayed for thee</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that thy faith faile not;</hi> that is, I have prayed that God would put ſtrength into thee, that <hi>thy faith faile not;</hi> if once faith faile we are overcome. But is faith our ſtrength? No; but faith goes to and takes hold of him who is our ſtrength, or who puts ſtrength into us that we fall not in temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. But you will ſay, <hi>Peter</hi> fell, and he fell grievouſly, his fall was great; he denyed his Maſter. 'Tis true, <hi>Peter</hi> fell, but he did not fall away, <hi>his faith did not faile,</hi> that is, it was not totally loſt, and therefore when Chriſt lookt upon him, and by that looke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed his ſtrength, he gat up againe: even when he denied Chriſt there was a ſeed of faith remaining in him, though like a tree in the winter, his fruit was gone, yea and his leaves too, and he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dead and withered, yet there was ſap in the roote; his faith fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not; whence was this? he had an inviſible ſupply of ſtrength from God; <hi>I have prayed</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that thy faith faile not.</hi> The prayer of Chriſt fayled not, and therefore his faith did not; Chriſt prayed that he might have ſtrength by beleeving, and though he had not ſo much faith as to preſerve him ſtanding, yet he had ſo much faith as to raiſe him from his fall. And what Chriſt prayed for <hi>Peter,</hi> he prayed for all that ſhould beleeve on his name, that in all their reſiſtings of, and contendings with tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their faith alſo may not fayle. As faith is one principall piece of our ſpirituall armour whereby we overcome temptation, ſo it fetches in that which is the whole of the whole Armour of God, even the ſtrength of God. When the Apoſtle exhorts Saints (<hi>Eph.</hi> 6.11.) <hi>To put on the whole armour of God;</hi> He premiſes
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:153845:189"/> another moſt needfull exhortation, or exhorts them firſt (<hi>v.</hi> 10.) <hi>to be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might;</hi> implying, that it is not any one piece, no nor the whole armour of God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractly or preciſely taken, which is our ſtrength, but that the God of this Armour is our ſtrength in the ſpirituall combate. <hi>Though our loynes were girt about with truth, and we have on the breaſt-plate of righteouſneſſe, though our feete were ſhod with the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel of peace, and we have the ſhield of faith in our hand; though we ſhould take the helmet of ſalvation, and the ſword of the Spirit which is the word of God,</hi> yet, if thus arrayed, it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for us to neglect or forget the God of the Word, it were not poſſible for us to conquer, the <hi>footmen,</hi> leſſer, much leſſe the <hi>horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> Greater, leaſt of all, <hi>The Charets of iron,</hi> the greateſt tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Prince of darknes. As no carnal weapon hath any thing at all to doe, ſo no ſpirituall weapon can doe any thing at all in this warre without the ſtrength of God; or rather (to conclude this poynt) all theſe ſpirituall weapons and Armour are nothing elſe but the ſtrength of God, or the various puttings forth of the ſtrength of God in weake man.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly and laſtly, God gives us ſtrength to pray to and plead our cauſe before him; he will not dazle us with his glory, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found us with his Majeſty when we come to plead with him, but he will put ſtrength into us. In prayer we prevaile with God, but the ſtrength whereby we prevaile with God, comes from God; yea he doth not onely give us ſtrength in prayer to act by, but he acts that ſtrength in prayer. (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.) <hi>Likewiſe the Spirit helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it ſelfe maketh interceſſion for us with groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings which cannot be uttered.</hi> Prayer is ſtrong worke, it calls forth the whole ſtrength of the ſoul, nor doth the ſoule in any thing ſhew its ſtrength more then in prayer; praying is wreſtling, and how can we wreſtle without ſtrength? Even the king of <hi>Ninevy</hi> gave this direction at his faſt (<hi>Jon.</hi> 3.8.) <hi>Let them cry mightily. And our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in the dayes of his fleſh offered up pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſupplications with ſtrong crying and teares</hi> (Heb. 5.7.) Now, the Spirit is the ſtrength of God in us, for prayer: he help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our infirmities, and we are onely a bundle of infirmities with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his helpe. There is a threefold ſtrength needfull in prayer, and God by the Spir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t puts theſe three ſtrengths into us.</p>
                  <pb n="351" facs="tcp:153845:189"/>
                  <p>Firſt, The Spirit helpes us with ſtrength of argument to plead with God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Spirit helpes us with ſtrength of faith in taking hold upon God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Spirit helpes us with ſtrength of patience in wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon God till we receive what we have prayed for. <hi>Jacob</hi> by this threefold <hi>ſtrength had power with God in prayer</hi> (Hoſ. 12.3.) and it was the power or Spirit of God by which he had this three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſtrength to prevaile with God. Thus <hi>we are ſtrengthened with might by the Spirit in the inner man</hi> (Eph. 3.16.) We are ſtrong to doe, and ſtrong to ſuffer, we are ſtrong to mortifie corruptions, and ſtrong to conquer temptations, we are ſtrong to pray and ſtrong to plead our cauſe at the throane of Grace, when God puts ſtrength into us. <hi>Job</hi> who had received great ſtrength from God in all the former caſes, was aſſured that he ſhould receive ſtrength alſo in the laſt, were he admitted to the ſeate of God. Would he (there) plead againſt me with his great power? No, but he would put ſtrength in me, to plead with him. And as he was thus aſſured that God would put ſtrength into him to plead his cauſe, ſo alſo liberty and freedome to doe it; as appeares more fully in the next verſe.</p>

(<hi>Chap.</hi> 9.34, 35.) <hi>Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his feare ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie me; then would I ſpeake and not feare him, but it is not ſo with me;</hi> as yet <hi>God pleadeth againſt me with his great power.</hi> Againe, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 13.21, 22.) <hi>Withdraw thy hand farre from me, and let not thy dread make me afraid</hi> (as if he had ſayd, <hi>Plead not againſt me with thy great power) then call thou and I will anſwer, or let me
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:153845:190"/> ſpeake, and anſwer thou me.</hi> Thoſe Texts already opened are of the fame generall ſcope and tendency with this underhand; <hi>There</hi> (that is, All things being put into ſuch a poſture) <hi>the righteous might diſpute with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some read the text in the firſt perſon; <hi>There, I, being righteous might diſpute with him.</hi> Others, thus; <hi>I ſhould be found righteous if I did diſpute with him;</hi> As if he had ſayd; <hi>I make no doubt of proving my ſelfe righteous or innocent in this controverſie with my friends; There I ſhould not be found a falſe-hearted hypocrite, God who knowes both my thoughts and my wayes, would judge otherwiſe of me, then men have done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We reade the text indefinitely, not reſtraining it to his perſon, but as taking in any that are righteous; <hi>The righteous,</hi> that is, <hi>any righteous man might diſpute with him there;</hi> his Court, his tribunal is free, and open for all that are upright or righteous. In what ſenſe the word <hi>righteous</hi> is uſed in this Booke hath been opened more then once. In a word, the righteous man is not he that is legally righteous, but righteous in a redeemer, or righteous as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to an hypocrite. In both theſe ſenſes, we may take the word here; <hi>The righteous may diſpute with him.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>God is free, and ready to heare, the pleadings, and reaſonings of thoſe who are upright and righteous.</q>
                  <p>As the prayer of the upright is the delight of God, ſo their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and humble diſputings are not diſpleaſing to him. A righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man may plead with God freely, but he muſt not plead with God proudly, eyther crying up and boaſting in his owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, or laying the leaſt imputation of unrighteouſneſſe upon the wayes of God in dealing with him. The righteous diſpute with God, yet they know and keep their diſtance, and while they doe ſo, God is willing they ſhould, and welcomes them when they
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:153845:190"/> doe draw nigh to him, diſputing as wel as praying. In oppoſition to which 'tis ſayd (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.5.) <hi>The fooliſh ſhall not ſtand in thy ſight, thou hateſt all workers of iniquity. The fooliſh,</hi> that is, the wicked man, the hypocrite with his falſe-hearted and flattering tongue, are an abomination to God. The fooliſh man that the Pſalmiſt meanes, is not the man low in parts, but unſound in ſpirit. This fooliſh man ſhall not ſtand in the ſight of God, nor will God heare him eyther diſputing or praying, but reject him with his diſputes and prayers. <hi>Thou hateſt all the workers of iniquity, and to the wicked God ſaith, what haſt thou to doe to declare my ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, or that thou ſhouldeſt take my Covenant in thy mouth</hi> (Pſal. 50.16.) God will not endure it, that wicked men ſhould ſpeake of him, much leſſe will he endure, that a wicked man ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with him. God will have nothing to doe in way of arguing, and reaſoning, eyther with a perſon or with a people, while he or they continue in their ſinnes. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.15, 16.) <hi>When ye ſpread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; yea when ye make many prayers, I will not heare; your hands are full of blood;</hi> that is, eyther of bloody ſinnes in ſpeciall, as murder and oppreſſion, or of ſinnes in generall; for every ſin is blood and bloody, every ſin may be called blood: and while the hands are full of blood in ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſence, God will not heare, that is, he will not graciouſly heare or accept ſo much as one of many prayers. But are the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and their prayers and their diſputings excluded for ever? while they continue ſuch, or to doe ſuch things they are; and therefore in the next words, the Lord by his Prophet gives them this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; <hi>Waſh ye, make ye cleane, put away the evill of your doings from before my eyes, ceaſe to doe evill, learne to doe well, ſeeke judgement, releive the oppreſſed, judge the fatherleſſe, plead for the widdow;</hi> here's a deſcription of a righteous perſon, righteous in his way, upright with God and men; and with ſuch God will ſpeake, ſuch may diſpute with him, as it follows (<hi>v.</hi> 18.) <hi>Come now, and let us reaſon together. We know</hi> (ſaith the blind man after he was healed) (<hi>Joh.</hi> 9.31.) <hi>that God heareth not ſinners</hi> (that is, ſuch as plead for or pleaſe themſelves in any ſin) <hi>but if any man be a worſhipper of God, and doth his will, him he heareth;</hi> him he heareth praying, and him he heareth diſputing. Whereas of the prayings of the wicked he ſaith, <hi>they are but meere bablings,</hi> and of their diſputings, <hi>they are but vaine fanglings. If</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſ. 66.
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:153845:191"/> 18.) <hi>I regard iniquity in my heart, God will not heare me;</hi> God will not regard his prayers, therefore not his diſputes, who regards iniquity; but to the righteous and to ſuch as repent of and turne from their unrighteouſneſſe, the Lord ſaith, <hi>Come let us reaſon to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> let us diſpute the poynt; <hi>Though your ſinnes be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow, though they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wool.</hi> Where take notice, by the way, that while God ſaith, <hi>your ſins which were as skarlet ſhall be as white as ſnow,</hi> we are not to thinke that ſin ſhall ever change colour, or be other then it is in the eyes of God: ſo that <hi>your ſin ſhall be as ſnow,</hi> is you ſinners ſhall be ſo. It is a very hard thing, and next to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility to change the nature of a ſinner, yea or the cuſtome of a ſinner (<hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23.) but it is altogether impoſſible to change the nature and conſtitution, yea or the complexion and colour of a ſin, that lookes ever red, but the <hi>reddeſt ſinner</hi> may turne <hi>white as ſnow.</hi> And when once the ſinner is turned white, God is ready to heare both his prayers, and diſputes. God loves to heare ſuch penitents confeſſing their ſinne, unburdening their conſcience, pleading the promiſe. And he loves to heare the righteous hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out and maintaining the righteouſneſſe of their wayes (againſt all the clamours and calumnies of men) before him. <hi>There the righteous may diſpute with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>The righteous are willing and have priviledge to diſpute or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue their cauſe with God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The righteous have acceſſe to God, and boldnes with him in the blood of Chriſt; So that they dare not onely, firſt, tell him of their own wants, or ſecondly, of their wrongs from others, or third-of their integrity, and the uprightneſſe of their hearts with him, and that he knows it is ſo, but fourthly (which argues the greateſt hight of holy boldnes) they dare tell him of all the ſinnes which they have committed againſt him, and diſpute with him for mercy as their right upon the account of his owne promiſe and covenant made with Chriſt in their behalfe, while reſpecting and reflecting upon themſelves they can juſtifie God in condemning them for ever under wrath. Here is the right Goſpel-Logicke; Theſe are the holy ſubtleties which the Spirit teacheth; Theſe are none of the <hi>diſputers of this world, whoſe wiſdome</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:153845:191"/> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20.) <hi>God hath made fooliſh and will deſtroy;</hi> but theſe are <hi>Divine Diſputants indeed,</hi> or diſputers for another world, whoſe wiſdome is of God, and who are <hi>wiſe unto ſalvation. Theſe righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ones may diſpute with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>So ſhould I be for ever delivered from my Judge.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> proceeds from the theſis to the hypotheſis, from the third perſon to the firſt; The righteous man pleads with him, but he doth not ſay, <hi>ſo ſhould the righteous be delivered for ever from his judge;</hi> but <hi>ſo ſhall I be delivered for ever from my judge;</hi> thus he puts himſelfe expreſſely into the number of the righteous or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and his argument ſtands thus;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He that is righteous, or upright, may diſpute and be acquitted or delivered when he diſputes with his Judge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But I am righteous, or upright.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore I ſhall be delivered from my judge when I diſpute with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Major propoſition is layd downe in the former part of this verſe; The Aſſumption in <hi>v.</hi> 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.

                     </note> I ſhould eſcape the ſeverity of his ſentence. The Judge hath him that comes before him in hold, he hath him in his hand or power when his caſe is pleading, but when a man is acquitted, then he is delivered from his Judge, that is, from the condemning ſentence of his Judge, then he is pronounced free, or (as we ſay) acquitted by Proclamation; no man may then medle with him, or charge his crime upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. <hi>Job</hi> was aſſured that he ſhould come off well at his tryall, and that there could be no bringing of the matter about againe. <hi>I ſhould be delivered for ever;</hi> that is, I ſhould never be queſtioned more, I ſhould ſee an end, or final dermination of my cauſe.<note place="margin">Vindicabor ad victoriam vel eternitatem u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum enim <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The word which we tranſlate <hi>for ever,</hi> ſignifies both <hi>victory,</hi> and <hi>eternity; I ſhould be delivered victoriouſly and eternally, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to victory or eternity from my Judge.</hi> The ſame word ſignifies <hi>victory</hi> and <hi>eternity</hi> in the Original, becauſe eternity gets the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over all. <hi>Time is a great Conquerour,</hi> that eats out all things here below, whoſe pedegree is from below; <hi>but eternity will eate it out,</hi> and conquer time it ſelfe; eternity is the greateſt Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:153845:192"/> 
                     <hi>For ever</hi> is the ſaddeſt and ſweeteſt word (upon different ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts) in the whole Bible; to be condemned had not ſo much ſadnes in it, were it not <hi>for ever,</hi> and to be juſtifyed, had not ſo much ſweetnes in it, were it not <hi>for ever.</hi> This word <hi>for ever</hi> weighs moſt both in refence to mercy and to judgement. <hi>Job</hi> ſayd the utmoſt to his owne comfort, when he ſaid, <hi>I ſhall be delivered,</hi> or (as M. <hi>Broughton</hi> tranſlates) <hi>be quit for ever by my Judge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is yet a queſtion concerning the Judge, or who the Judge is from whom he ſhould be delivered. Our reading ſeemes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it of God himſelfe. Others by the Judge underſtand his friends or others who charged him ſo hardly. There is yet a third opinion which ſuppoſeth the Judge to be ſome third perſon,<note place="margin">Judicem intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligit apud quem ipſe ſuam cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam ageret ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſus deum; facit enim deum velut litigato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem; quaſi co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram tertio quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam judice cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa diſceptetur. <hi>Merc.</hi>
                     </note> who ſhould umpire the buſienes between God and him. I rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that by his Judge he meanes God himſelfe, to whoſe righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and mercifull tribunal he appealed from the hard ſentence and judgement of his friends. And who having once declared his judgement, not onely the cenſures but even the ſuſpitions of all men, whether friends or enemies, would be ſilenced for ever. And ſo laſtly, we may take the word <hi>Judge,</hi> which is here indefinitely propoſed, univerſally. As if he had ſayd; when once God hath had the hearing of my cauſe I ſhall not need to feare any, what they can ſay, or do againſt me, in the capacity of a Judge. <hi>So ſhould I be delivered for ever from my Judge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve;
<q>God will for ever acquit the righteous, nor ſhall any have power to condemne thoſe whom he hath once acquitted.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt</hi> (Rom. 8.1.) as much as to ſay, ſuch ſhall be for ever delivered from their judge. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God who Juſtifieth</hi> (Rom. 8.33.) Though ſome will preſume to lay many and grievous things to the charge of Gods Elect, yet God having Juſtified them,<note place="margin">Hac ratione li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber evaderem ab iniquis vitae meae Judicibus &amp; calumniato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus, ut ultra mihi diſcepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione &amp; conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione opus non erit.</note> all their charges ſhall be reprobated and rejected. God who hath once Juſtified a perſon, will never lay any thing to his charge, and what charge ſoever others bring againſt him, Gods juſtification will take it off. The Apoſtles challenge is univerſal, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing</hi> &amp;c? It is univerſal two wayes. Firſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of perſons accuſing, he excepts none in earth, heaven, or hell. Secondly, in regard of crimes, he excepts no ſort of ſinne,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:153845:192"/> let them ſeeke and finde what they can, be they ſins againſt God or man, be they ſins of omiſſion or commiſſion, be they ſins ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much aggravated, or ſadly circumſtantiated, though againſt both light and love, yet they will not doe againſt a perſon Elect and Juſtified. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect?</hi> wipes away all charges. Accuſed they may be, though juſtified, but condemned they cannot be, becauſe juſtified. The beſt of Saints on earth have much in them, and much is done by them, which might be matter of charge againſt them (for he that ſaith he hath no ſin in him, hath indeed no truth in him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.8.) but Juſtifying Grace is their full diſcharge.</p>
                  <p>Againe, As the word <hi>Judge,</hi> is expounded univerſally, for all thoſe that did or might accuſe <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> had thoſe who layd to his charge things that he knew not (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.11.) The <hi>Jewes</hi> returned from <hi>Babylon</hi> to build their City and Temple, were charged with ſedition; <hi>Jeremie</hi> was charged with treaſon; <hi>Paul</hi> was called, <hi>a peſtilent fellow;</hi> and the primitive Chriſtians were generally loaded with ſlaunders by the Heathen. Miſreport and reproach are the portion of Saints from the world. And how ſadly <hi>Job</hi> was charged all along by his friends, and how ſeverely cenſured, hath appeared every where in this Booke, eſpecially in the former Chapter (<hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6, 7.) <hi>Is not thy wickednes great, and thine iniquities infinite? for thou haſt taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and ſtripped the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of their cloathing</hi> &amp;c. Had not <hi>Job</hi> reaſon to looke upon it as a great mercy to be delivered from ſuch a Judge. And hath not every Godly man reaſon to make <hi>Davids</hi> choyce (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.14.) <hi>Let me fall into the hand of the Lord (for his mercies are great) and let me not fall into the hand of men.</hi> Now as men are for the moſt part over-ſevere executioners of Gods ſentence, ſo they are uſually over-ſevere Judges in giving their owne whether ſence or ſentence concerning others. And therefore <hi>Jobs</hi> faith did prophecy this good to himſelfe, That God having heard him, and judged him, he <hi>ſhould be delivered for euer from</hi> (man) <hi>his Judge.</hi> And let this be the comfort of the righteous who are oppreſſed
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:153845:193"/> with the hard opinions of men, That, <hi>God will at laſt deliver them for ever from every rigorous and unrighteous Judge.</hi> In that Great day (as the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> calls it) the cauſe of every righteous man ſhall be diſputed before God, and then they ſhall be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for ever from their Judge. And this did exceedingly beare up the ſpirit of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in the midſt of the various cenſures and judgements of men concerning him; he knew their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be taken off at laſt, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4.) <hi>With me it is a very ſmall thing that I ſhould be judged of you, or of mans judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yea I judge not my owne ſelfe; But he that judgeth me is the Lord, therefore judge nothing before the time till the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkneſſe, and make manifeſt the counſells of the hearts, and then ſhall every man have praiſe of God;</hi> That is, every righteous man, though diſprai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and deſpiſed, though judged and condemned by men, though blackt over with falſe reports and reproaches, yet then every righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man ſhall have praiſe from the moſt righteous God. He will then doe all his people right who have been wronged, and paſſe a juſt ſentence upon thoſe who have ſuffered much and long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unjuſt cenſures. <hi>And ſo ſhall they be for ever delivered from their Judge.</hi>

Expreſſing himſelfe here as a man that had travelled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all parts and quarters of the world, Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South, to finde a friend, yet could not meet with him. <hi>Behold I goe forward but he is not there, and backward but I cannot perceive him. On the left hand where he doth worke, but I cannot behold him, he hideth himſelfe on the right hand that I cannot ſee him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a threefold ſcope held forth about theſe words.</p>
               <p>Firſt, As if <hi>Job</hi> did here deplore his fruitles paines, in wiſhing for his appearing before God, and in appealing to his Tribunal; for as yet he ſaw himſelfe unanſwered and fruſtrated in his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation; God did not appeare to him in his troubles, nor declare his purpoſe towards him.<note place="margin">Declarat Job ſe non poſſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione humana, per res natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les (quas per quatuor mundi plagas ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat) cognoſcere certò &amp; clare rationes divino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum judicio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. <hi>Pined.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, His ſcope may be to aſſert the hiddennes of the wayes of God, or that the wayes of God are not to be found out, nor underſtood by all the paines and induſtry, by all the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and diſquiſitions of man; let him turne himſelfe which way he will, <hi>Eaſt or Weſt, North or South,</hi> yet he muſt ſay, <hi>I cannot behold him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Some conceive that <hi>Jobs</hi> intent is to declare his owne underſtanding or meaning in that earneſt wiſh which he lately
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:153845:194"/> made,<note place="margin">Haec ſubjungit ad declarandu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dei immenſita tem, ne quis putaret eum ex iſtimaſſe, deum corporeum eſſe aut corporali loco circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi cum de illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us tribunali lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quutus eſt. <hi>Id:</hi>
                  </note> about his admittance to the Throne of God; <hi>O that I knew where I might finde him, that I might come even to his ſeat</hi> (v. 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>) He was not ſo groſſe as to thinke that God was Confined to any place, or that he had a Seat on which he ſate, as the Princes of the Earth have; and therefore he affirmes, that God is <hi>every where, and no where;</hi> that he is every where indeed, though he could not finde him appearing to him any where; as if he had ſayd, I doe not circumſcribe God in my apprehenſions to this or that place; I enquire after him <hi>Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South,</hi> that is, all the world over, yet I miſs of him and have not attained my purpoſe to this houre; for he hath not yet manifeſted himſelfe unto mee. This ſeemes to be the generall ſcope of theſe three verſes, which have two things eſpecially Conſiderable in them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Jobs</hi> ſolicitous Complaint of the Lords hideing himſelfe from him after all his ſearchings.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Comfort which <hi>Job</hi> tooke in the Integrity of his owne heart, and in the clearnes of his Conſcience, that if once he came to tryall, all would be well with him.</p>
               <p>The 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſes are all of one Importance, which I ſhall briefly open, and then give ſome notes from them.</p>

                  <p>I anſwer; Though God worketh all the world over, yet God worketh in ſome parts of the world in a more eminent manner. God worketh ſo in ſome places, as if he did worke no where elſe: All places are the worke of God by Creation, and God worketh in all places by his providence. The workes of creation would run to ruine, if God did not ſuſtaine, and as it were keepe them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration by the workes of providence, yet as God worketh in ſome men, and by ſome men, more then in, nnd by others, ſome
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:153845:195"/> perſons are to him as his right hand, he calls them forth to be greatly inſtrumentall to him. So hee worketh in ſome places, and nations, and by ſome places and nations more then he doth in or by others. God is a free Agent, he worketh where he will, and he pitcheth upon ſome ſpeciall places, and perſons, (according to the pleaſure of his owne will) to worke in, and by, more then many others. And ſeing according to this Interpretation, <hi>The left hand where he is ſaid to worke</hi> ſo eminently, is the North.</p>
                  <p>Wee may obſerve;
<q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That God worketh more in the Northern parts of the world then he doth in the South.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the reaſon of this may be, becauſe the Northern parts of the world are more inhabited and peopled then the Southern are. And which may be a ſecond reaſon of it, The Inhabitants of the Northern parts of the world are more civillized and better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed then the Southerne: Now the providences of God are moſt remarkable where there are moſt people, and they beſt taught and inſtructed, where the natural faculties of man are moſt raiſed and ſublimated by art and regular education, there or by them God doth his greateſt workes; thoſe places are (as it were) the ſtages whereon he acts and brings to iſſue the ſecret purpoſes and counſels of his heart, both in wayes of judgement and in wayes of mercy.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, we finde that the Northerne Nations have in all ages been the moſt active and warlike.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Fourth Monarchy,</hi> That of the <hi>Romanes</hi> whoſe ſeate was more Northerly then any of the former three, was the moſt active and warlike of the Foure, and extended its Dominion by extreame and unwearyed induſtry further then any had done before. And thoſe irruptions of enemies and Armyes which gaue the greateſt checke to the Romane Greatneſs, and often plum'd or pull'd off the Feathers of that mighty Eagle, were ſtill made by thoſe people who lived and were bred up in climates more cold and Northerly then they; as all Hiſtoryes doe with one conſent make good. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that it grew into a Famous Proverb;<note place="margin">Omne malum ab aquilone.</note> 
                     <hi>All evill comes from the North,</hi> that is, <hi>all troubles, invaſions, and devaſtations are brought upon the Nations by ſome hardy people or other coming out of the North.</hi> And the holy Scriptures of the Prophets are full of
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:153845:196"/> this obſervation (<hi>Jer.</hi> 1.14, 15.) <hi>Then the Lord ſayd unto me, out of the North an evill ſhall breake forth upon all the Inhabitants of the land. For lo I will call all the familyes of the kingdome of the North, ſaith the Lord, and they ſhall come, and they ſhall ſet every one his throane at the entrance of the gates of Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. By <hi>The North</hi> in this prophecy, he meanes <hi>Chaldea and Babylon,</hi> which are ſcituate North from <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And by <hi>all the familyes of the kingdomes of the North,</hi> he meanes all the Northerne parts under the obedience of the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who ſhould readily follow and ſerve him in his warres againſt <hi>Judea.</hi> Againe in the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet (<hi>Ch</hi> 4.6.) <hi>I will bring evill out of the North</hi> (Ch. 6.1.) <hi>Evill appeareth out of the North</hi> (ver. 22) <hi>A people comes forth from the North</hi> (Chap. 10.22.) <hi>Behold a great commotion out of the North.</hi> And when the Lord promiſed to remove far away from his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the <hi>Northerne Army,</hi> (Joel 2.20.) he therein promiſed them the removall of all Armyes and troubles, becauſe the North had moſt of all, if not alone troubled and harrazed them with Armyes. Againe, In the North, the Goſpel (which is the higheſt teaching and inſtruction) hath been more generally and more clearely pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed then in the Southern parts of the world; ſo that in alluſion to that of the Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.26.) we may ſay, That the light of our <hi>Northern Moone</hi> hath been as the <hi>light of the Southern Sun, and that the light of our Sun hath been ſeven-fold to theirs, even as the light of ſeven dayes.</hi> And according to the greatnes of Goſpel light, the diſpenſations, and changes, which we have been under, have been very great; we eſpecially in this Northern Nation, with thoſe adjoyning to us and united with us under one Government, have had full Experience of, and may therefore (giving glory to God) ſeale to the truth of <hi>Jobs</hi> poſition; That God worketh on the left hand, or in the North. Have not we found God working in the North? What changes, what variety of action have our Northern parts both ſeene and felt? What wonders of mercy and ſalvation? what terrible things in righteouſnes hath God wrought of late among us? The heavens and the earth, States of all ſorts, The heavenly and the earthly, and of all degrees, the higher and the lower have been terribly ſhaken in theſe Nations. Providence hath wrought to amazement in our dayes; The Nations round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout have heard the report of it, and wondered. Many have and will have cauſe to ſay of us, what hath God wrought! on the left
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:153845:196"/> hand, in our North, God hath been at worke indeed!</p>
                  <p>Moreover, we finde that Mount <hi>Sion</hi> (which was not onely an eminent part of the literall <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but a figure alſo of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or whole Church of God under the Goſpel (<hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22.) This Mount <hi>Sion</hi> (I ſay) is Geographically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in our Northerly ſcituation (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 48.2, 3. <hi>Beautifull for ſcituation, the joy of the whole earth is Mount Sion; on the ſides of the North, the City of the Great King. God is knowne in her palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for a refuge.</hi> As if he had ſayd, in <hi>Sion,</hi> on the ſides of the North God worketh wonderfully, as it follows expreſſely (<hi>v.</hi> 4, 5.) <hi>for lo the kings were aſſembled, they paſſed by together, they ſaw it and ſo they marveiled, they were troubled and haſted away:</hi> that is, Kings conſpiring againſt the Church were ſo terrified with the evidences of Gods power working mightily there, that they fled away, or as another Scripture phraſeth it, <hi>They came one way and returned ſeven.</hi> And in this forme of ſpeech is both the then <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and the Church ever ſince expreſſed, in that boaſt which the king of <hi>Babylon</hi> (who was a type of all the enemies of the Church cloathed with mighty power and ſoveraignty) makes againſt her, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.13.) <hi>I will ſit alſo</hi> (that is, erect my throane) <hi>upon the Mount of the Congregation on the ſides of the North.</hi> Mount <hi>Sion</hi> was called the Mount of the Congregation, becauſe there the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God the <hi>Jewes</hi> were famouſly knowne to congregate often together, and this (ſaith that proud boaſter) on the ſides of the North. And to compleate this notion of the workings of God in and from the North, <hi>Chriſt himſelfe is ſayd to be rayſed out of the North;</hi> For ſo ſome expound that Scripture (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.25.) <hi>I have rayſed up one out of the North, and he ſhall come, from the riſing of the Sun ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The greateſt workes of God that ever were done, Chriſt did them; and therefore the North, may juſtly be called the place where he worketh, ſeing he rayſed Chriſt from thence.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As the words are read thus; <hi>On the left hand while hee worketh;</hi> as if <hi>Job</hi> had ſayd, I look after God <hi>on the left hand,</hi> or <hi>in the North,</hi> even in the time while he is working, or doing great things, and yet I cannot behold him.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>
                        <pb n="366" facs="tcp:153845:197"/>That God may be, and often is, working great things, and we not able to apprehend or behold him at his worke.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The inviſible thengs of God, even his eternal power and Godhead are ſeene in the things that are made,</hi> and that not onely in the things that he made while he created the world, but alſo in the things which he makes while he governes the world, and yet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is not ſeene in making them; and that not onely becauſe he is inviſible in his nature, but becauſe (which is the poynt in hand) the manner of his working is inviſible. In ſome things God workes ſo evidently, that the natural man cannot but ſay, <hi>The finger of God is here.</hi> But in other things he workes ſo ſecretly, that the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all man is not able to ſee where the finger of God is, unleſſe upon that general acknowledgement that the finger of God is every where. <hi>Solomon</hi> (Prov. 30.18.) ſaith, <hi>There be three things which are too wonderfull for mee; yea, foure which I know not; the way of an Eagle in the ayre, the way of a Serpent upon a rock, and the way of a Ship in the midſt of the Sea;</hi> even ſuch are the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God, the wayes and workings of God among the ſons of men; <hi>A ſhip in the Sea</hi> leaves no track, no path, you cannot ſee where the Ship hath ſailed; The ſhip plowes the Ocean, but the furrowes are unſeene as ſoone as made. <hi>A Serpent upon a rock,</hi> makes no dint, leaves no footſteps behinde him; the flying Eagle parts the aire, but there's no diſcerning where ſhee hath paſt.</p>
                  <p>And thus <hi>Job</hi> ſeemes to ſpeake here; <hi>Though I goo to the North while God worketh,</hi> yet I can ſee no more of him, then of the way of an Eagle in the aire, or of a Serpent upon a rock, or of a Ship in the Sea, <hi>I cannot behold him while he worketh,</hi> nor the way of his working. And further,
<q>Hee hideth himſelfe on the right hand that I cannot ſee him.</q>

                     </note>The word which we render <hi>hideth,</hi> ſignifieth, to wrap up with a covering, implying that God doth cover himſelfe from the eye of man, in or with the <hi>right hand</hi> part of the world. Some render it thus; <hi>He hideth his right hand,</hi> or <hi>his working hand, that I cannot ſee him.</hi> We render it well, <hi>hee hideth himſelfe on the right hand that I cannot ſee him. The right hand,</hi> is put in oppoſition to <hi>the left,</hi> mentioned in the former part of the verſe. There, in the South, God doth (as it were) purpoſely and artificially hide, and caſt a
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:153845:197"/> vaile over himſelfe (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) leſt I ſhould ſee him there, hee keeps himſelfe yet more out of my view and reach then elſewhere. The word which we tranſlate, the <hi>right hand,</hi> ſignifies <hi>the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern parts of the world</hi> (Cant. 4.16.) <hi>Awake O Northwinde, and come thou South, blow upon my Garden.</hi> (Exod. 26.18.) <hi>On the South</hi> (or <hi>right) ſide Southward.</hi> The word is alſo rendred, <hi>the right ſide,</hi> (2 Sam. 24.5.) <hi>On the right ſide of the City.</hi> Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the word ſignifies, as the <hi>right hand,</hi> ſo alſo <hi>ſtrength,</hi> becauſe the right hand is ſtrongeſt in moſt men and readyeſt for uſe. And ſo <hi>he hides himſelfe on the right hand</hi> may import (as was toucht before) that God hideth himſelfe even there, where he puts forth his ſtrength and power.</p>
                  <p>From all theſe expoſitions layd together, in that <hi>Job</hi> here ſaith, hee <hi>went forward and backward,</hi> or Eaſt and Weſt, on <hi>the right hand, and on the left,</hi> or <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South</hi> (from all I ſay) it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares that <hi>Job</hi> was a great traveller, that he travel'd all the world over; yet where was <hi>Job</hi> when he ſpake all this? Was he not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his bed? was he not Gods Priſoner, ſhut up in his Chamber, when he ſaid, <hi>I goe forward and backward, Northward and South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and yet I finde him not, perceive him not, ſee him not.</hi>

                  <p>Hence learne.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That God is every where.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> knew there was a preſence of God forward and backward, Northward and Southward, He knew that God fills heaven and earth with his preſence. There is a preſence of God from which the worſt of men cannot goe, and there is a preſence of God into which, many times, the beſt of men cannot get; there was a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God out of which <hi>Job</hi> could not get, while (according to his deſires) he could not get into the preſence of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From thoſe various negatives here uſed, <hi>I cannot perceive him, I cannot behold him, I cannot ſee him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>God is a ſpirit, not viſible at all in himſelfe, and he onely appeares, as and to whom himſelfe pleaſeth to appeare to and among men.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The appearances of God are not naturall but voluntary, when his will is to be ſeene he gives man the priviledge to ſee him. It is altogether impoſſible to ſee him with a bodily eye, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16.)
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:153845:198"/> 
                     <hi>God onely hath Immortality, dwelling in the light that no man can approach unto, whom no man hath ſeen, nor can ſee,</hi> that is, with bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily eyes, and as it is impoſſible to ſee him at any time with an eye of ſence, ſo he will not alwayes be ſeene by the eye of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, no nor alwayes by the eye of faith. Faith ſhall hereafter be perfected in the viſion of God, but here faith is ſometime quite deprived of the viſion of God, <hi>He hideth himſelfe from the houſe of Jacob.</hi> Faith is oppoſed to all bodily ſight (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7.) <hi>We walke by faith not by ſight;</hi> and faith hath not alwayes a ſpirituall ſight. It is ſaid (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.27.) that <hi>Moſes ſaw him that is Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,</hi> he ſaw him with a ſpirituall eye, the eye of faith; wee have reaſon to beleeve, that <hi>Job</hi> at that time, ſaw God with an eye of faith, but he ſaw him not with an eye of underſtanding, to diſcerne the way of his working with him. They who are moſt ſpirituall and of the largeſt underſtanding in ſpiritualls, can no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend God then a cockle-ſhel can containe the Ocean; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who are ſpirituall, are ſo darke in their underſtandings, or God is ſo darke to their underſtandings, that they cannot ſo much as apprehend or diſcerne him, ſee or perceive him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When <hi>Job</hi> ſayth, <hi>God hideth himſelfe on the right hand, or in the South,</hi> ſo that I cannot ſee him.</p>
                  <p>This teacheth us;
<q>That God doth ſometimes purpoſely withdraw and reſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from his moſt pretious ſervants.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Propher hath a ſtrange deſcription of God (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.15.) <hi>Verily thou art a God that hideſt thy ſelfe</hi> (as if he had ſayd) it is thy uſe and cuſtome to doe ſo) <hi>O God of Iſrael the Saviour;</hi> hee was the God and Saviour of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not ſee him, for he hid himſelfe; When God will conceale himſelfe, his <hi>Iſrael</hi> cannot ſee him. And hence wee finde in Scripture ſo many earneſt Deprecations, that God would not hide himſelfe, and ſo many vehement Expoſtulations when he did. <hi>Wherefore hideſt thou thy face</hi> (ſaith the Church, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.24.) <hi>and forgetteſt our affliction and oppreſſion?</hi> God hides himſelfe five wayes, or in five things from his people.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He hides his favour and the light of his Countenance from his people. And (when this is hid God is hid) hee will not let them ſee the love which he hath in his heart towards them,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:153845:198"/> yea (poſſibly) he lets them ſee anger, wrath, diſpleaſure; hee puts on the habit of an enemy, and deales with them as with ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. <hi>Job</hi> complaines more then once that God hid his favour from him, and ſhewed him nothing but his dread and terror.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God hides his workes from his people, hee will not let them be ſeen, nor be ſeene in them; <hi>O how unſearchable are thy Judgements, and thy wayes paſt finding out!</hi> God hath wayes and Judgements which man cannot reach unto. Some of his workes are acted (as we ſay) above bord, they are done in a cleare light, hee that runs may ſee and read them, and God in them; hee that runs may read love written upon ſome of them in letters of Gold, or with beames of light. And he that runs may read wrath written upon others of them in letters of blood, or with ſtreames of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and the very ſhadowes of death; but ſome workes of God are ſo curtaynd about and vailed, ſo hidden and obſcured, that we cannot perceive them. Though all the works of God are works of light, yet many of them are in the darke to man; <hi>While judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and righteouſneſſe are the habitation of Gods Throne, clouds and darknes are round about him,</hi> (Pſal. 97.2.)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God hideth the reaſon of his working. His works are often hid, but the reaſon of his working is oftener hid. <hi>Jeremy</hi> complaines, <hi>Why doth the way of the wicked proſper?</hi> Hee would know a reaſon of it; hee ſaw that God let the wicked proſper, but the reaſon he ſaw not.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The deſign, or end of the worke of God is a hidden thing; as God doth not let men ſee the reaſon why he doth this or that, ſo not his aime, and end, what he would have, or what he drives at in doing it. When God afflicts a Godly man, whether it be for the tryal of his graces, or to chaſten him for his failings, or for the purging out of his corruptions, is often his doubt: and as 'tis thus in perſonal workings, ſo alſo in publique workings; <hi>Whether God hath to doe with a Nation, or with a man onely, hee hath his ſecrets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, As God hides what himſelfe doth, ſo he hides from us what he would have us doe, he hides his owne will from us in ſome things; we have indeed his Letters Patents, his proclaimed lawes before us in all things needfull to ſalvation; but there are ſome things which concerne particular actings in our lives, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a godly man may be very ignorant of the will of God, &amp; much
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:153845:199"/> puzzled in his Spirit what to doe, whether this or that be the courſe which God would have him take. God hides himſelfe from us in the hidings of his will from us. For as when the Apoſtle ſaith (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.20.) <hi>Yee have not ſo learned Chriſt,</hi> wee are not to underſtand Chriſt perſonally, but Chriſt according to the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of himſelfe in the Goſpel, Chriſt there is the will or minde of Chriſt; ſo when God hideth himſelfe from or doth not diſcover himſelfe to us, the meaning may be this; hee doth not diſcover his minde and will to us, what he would have us doe, as to our particular caſe and condition. God keepes ſome long in ſuſpence, long in the darke about this poynt; ſo that they often cry out with that good King in his dangerous ſtrait, <hi>We know not what to doe, but our eyes are towards thee.</hi> (2 Chron. 20.12.) Many a man is in as great a ſtrait what to doe in regard of the darknes of his condition, as <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> was, in regard of the dangerouſneſſe of it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Note;
<q>
                        <hi>That,</hi> a Gracious ſoule uſeth all meanes to attaine what he deſires, eſpecially to finde out the minde and will of God in his workings.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What elſe is the meaning of all this? why elſe went <hi>Job</hi> forward and backward? why went he on the right hand, and on the left? why did he thus traverſe his ground, and repreſent himſelfe in theſe buſie enquiries after God, travelling in the multitude of his thoughts upon his bed from ſea to ſea, and from the river to the ends of the earth, leaving no ſtone unturned (as we ſay) nor path untrodden, that he might get his cauſe determined, and his heart ſetled. <hi>Obadiah</hi> tells <hi>Eliah</hi> after he had met him (ſee how indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious the malice of <hi>Ahab,</hi> againſt that holy man, made him to to finde him out whom his ſoule hated, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.10.) <hi>As the Lord thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdome whether my Lord hath not ſent to ſeek thee</hi> &amp;c. Not that <hi>Ahab</hi> had ſent Meſſengers into every quarter of the world, but the meaning is, that he had been very diligent and induſtrious to finde out <hi>Elijah.</hi> And ſo ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> there is not any Corner under heaven, where I have not been ſeeking to finde him whom my ſoule loveth and longeth for. Thereby importing his exceeding diligence to finde God. They who have a deſire after God indeed, will take paines for him, they will ſeek him, Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South, and never complaine of the length of their journey. They will not ſtay till God comes
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:153845:199"/> home to their dores, but out they will go to ſeek him. For though it be a truth that no man can ſeek or looke after God, till God hath firſt looked after and found him, yet they whom God hath once found, have ſuch an impreſſion left upon their hearts, that when God ſeemes to leave them, and to be as loſt to them, they will more then ſeeme to looke after and ſeeke him while he is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from them; that is, while he hides himſelfe from them. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God hath never toucht the hearts of thoſe lazie profeſſors that would faine be ſaved, but will goe neither forward nor backward, neither North nor South after Jeſus Chriſt; whereas if their deſires were true and genuine, they would uſe all meanes, goe all due wayes, leave nothing unaſſayed that might probably bring them to the knowledge and enjoyment of him; O how buſie was <hi>Job's</hi> ſpirit to finde out God? And ſo buſie ſhould our ſpirits be to finde him out, both for comfort and for counſel in all the turnings of our lives.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Obſerve;
<q>That after the uſe of much meanes to finde God, yet poſſibly God may not be found by us as to our apprehenſion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> ſpared no paines to finde out God, and yet he could not ſpeed at that time, after all his ſearch he found him not, he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him not, he did not behold him; you may pray, and ſeek, and adviſe, and waite, follow this meanes and that meanes to finde out God, or to recover the ſence of his gracious preſence with your ſoules, and yet (for a long time) miſſe of him. This is one of the exerciſes which God is pleaſed to put his people to, hee therefore hides that we may ſeek him; he doth not hide himſelfe becauſe he will not be found, but he hides himſelfe becauſe he will be ſought; and yet when he is ſought, and ſought in a right way too, he will not preſently be found. For though none that ſeek him in ſincerity, but ſhall finde him at laſt (<hi>He hath not ſaid to the ſeed of Jacob, ſeek yee my face in vaine;</hi> that is, ſeek mee and never finde mee, the Scripture ſpeakes no ſuch thing) nor did <hi>Job</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſeek and not finde; yet, as he in his time, ſo we in ours may ſeek him long and not finde him, and yet ſtill we muſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſeeking, becauſe God hides himſelfe that we may ſeek him more, not that he would have us give over ſeeking. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in times of deſertion, in hideing, and withdrawing times, doe
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:153845:200"/> not give over ſeeking; for the reaſon why God doth withdraw, is, that we may ſeek him more, <hi>and follow harder after him;</hi> that we may ſeek him (as <hi>Job</hi> did) <hi>Eaſt, Weſt, North,</hi> and <hi>South;</hi> that is, in all meanes, duties, ordinances, he will not alwayes hide himſelfe; that's the ſumme and ſcope of the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſes.</p>

                     <hi>Job</hi> could not finde the wayes of God, well (ſaith he) though I cannot finde out Gods wayes, yet God hath found out my wayes; though he is pleaſed to vaile his owne wayes, yet mine are open, He hideth himſelfe from me, but I am not hid from him. <hi>Hee knoweth the way that I take.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, In this verſe <hi>Job</hi> ſeemes to give a reaſon of his hope to ſpeed well at the ſeate or throane of God whether he had appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (<hi>v.</hi> 3.7.) As if he had ſaid, <hi>Seing my heart tels me, my way is good, and my Judge knowes it to be ſo, how can it be but that my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from him ſhould be Good?

                     <hi>To know,</hi> may be taken here two wayes; firſt, as an act of the Underſtanding onely, <hi>hee knoweth,</hi> that is, hee fully perceiveth and apprehendeth what my way is.</p>

The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew is, <hi>Hee knoweth the way that is in mee,</hi> hee doth not onely know my outward way, or the way that is without mee, but hee knowes my inward way, the way that is within mee. Wee have a way within us, and that is the way of our thoughts, and we have a way without us, and that is the way of our workes. <hi>Hee</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) knowes the way that is in mee,</hi> therefore much more the way without mee, hee knowes mee through and through; As if he had ſayd, what though I cannot finde him, yet I will leave my cauſe with him; for he needs no information of mine, to lead him into

                  </p>
                  <p>There are three things which <hi>Job</hi> might aime at in this ſentence.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, an account why he was ſure of a right judgement from God, becauſe he was not onely a Judge, but an eye-witneſſe of all the wayes that he had ever gone.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A confutation of his friends opinion of him, as if he were a man that did not feare God; whereas he did acknowledge that both himſelfe and all his wayes were viſible and manifeſt unto God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A ſtrong aſſertion of his owne innocency, ſeing he could ſpeake thus rejoycingly, that <hi>God knew all his wayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve;
<q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The way of man, even his moſt ſecret way, or the way with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, is knowne to God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God wraps up himſelfe often in the darknes of ſecrecy as to man, but man is never in that darknes as to God; the very chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of darknes, and the wayes of darknes are in the light to him. And as the wayes of evill men, and the evill of their wayes, ſo the wayes of good men, and the goodnes of their wayes, are knowne to God. We need not feare that the good we doe or have done (though no eye of man ſee it) ſhall be loſt in the darke. We ſcarce know our owne wayes, and wee cannot know our owne hearts, but God doth. (<hi>Jerem.</hi> 17.9.) <hi>The heart of man is deceitfull above all things, and deſperately wicked, who can know it?</hi> No man can know all the wayes of his heart; he cannot come to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of his owne heart, though he may know the bent of it; but (ſaith God) <hi>I ſearch the heart; much of our heart is a ſecret to our ſelves, but to God nothing of it is;</hi> he knowes our inſide fully. As he knowes our actions, ſo the grounds upon which wee act, and the ends for which we act, and the heart with which wee act; thus God knowes the way that every man takes. And thus none but God can know the wayes of man. Wee can trade no farther then upon the borders of mens wayes, their outward acts, as for the ſpirit and principle of them, whence they flow, as for the aymes and ends of them, whether they are flowing, with theſe God alone is intimate. And with theſe God is more intimate then man can be with that which is wholly outward.</p>
                  <pb n="374" facs="tcp:153845:201"/>
                  <p>And ſeing God knowes all the wayes which man takes; let no man goe about to hide his wayes from God; 'Tis vaine to hide any thing from him, who ſees all that is hidden. He that comes before a Judge that knowes what he hath done, and is able to prove it, why ſhould he deny it? The heart of a naturall man is not more buſied about any thing then in making veiles for his ſin; the firſt thing that man did after he had ſin'd was, to make ſuch a veile. As all men have ſinned after the ſimilitude of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, ſo they cover their tranſgreſſions according to the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of his covering. The Holy Ghoſt (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1.) calleth them <hi>bleſſed whoſe ſins are covered,</hi> but it is with a covering of Gods provideing, not of their owne; woe to thoſe whoſe ſinnes are hid by a covering of their owne provideing; God hath given us his Son our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his righteouſneſſe, for our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering; while our ſins are ſo covered bleſſed are we, but if we co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them with a covering of our owne, God will lay them open for ever to our ſhame. <hi>Wo to the rebellious children, ſaith the Lord,</hi> (Iſa. 30.1.) <hi>that take counſel but not of me, and that cover with a covering, but not of my Spirit, that they may adde ſin unto ſin;</hi> if we cover our ſins with any thing but the righteouſnes of Chriſt, we cover them with a ſin, not onely becauſe all our righteouſnes (which is the beſt thing of our owne that we have to cover them with) is ſinfull, but becauſe the very act of covering them ſo is a ſin; and therefore in ſo doing, what doe we but <hi>adde ſin unto ſin?</hi> And if to cover our ſins with our owne righteouſneſſe be a ſin, how doe we heape ſin upon ſin while we cover it (as many en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to doe) with our denyalls, diſſemblings and excuſes?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider with what Confidence <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes; hee had diſcourſed of his fruitles labour and travell in the uſe of all meanes to finde God; well (ſaith he) yet it is a Comfort that God knowes my wayes, though I cannot finde out his.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <q>It is the Joy of the upright, that God knowes them and their wayes, yea the wayes that are in them.</q>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Jeremy</hi> (Chap. 12.3.) having complained of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of evill men before the Lord, concludes, <hi>But thou O Lord knoweſt mee, thou haſt ſeen mee and tryed my heart toward thee;</hi> this was the Prophets joy, and ſo it was the Apoſtles, when he
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:153845:201"/> ſayd; <hi>But wee are made manifeſt unto God</hi> (2 Cor. 5.11.) That's the thing that pleaſeth us. <hi>David</hi> (1 Chron. 29.17.) ſpeakes in the ſame frame of ſpirituall contentment; <hi>I know alſo ô my God that thou tryeſt my heart, and haſt pleaſure in uprightnes;</hi> This was a pleaſure to <hi>David,</hi> this was his Joy and crowne of Rejoycing, that God knew him; and a godly man hath much Cauſe of rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in this, that God knowes him perfectly, conſidering how much he is miſtaken and miſunderſtood by men. When our wayes are miſtaken by men, 'tis great content to remember, that God knowes the way that we take without the leaſt miſtake. For this aſſures a godly man of three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That God will reckon his wayes ſuch as they are, and him ſuch a one as he is. He is much aſſured that God will never put a falſe gloſſe, or an unjuſt conſtruction (which men are apt to doe) upon the text of his life.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This aſſures him that his workes of righteouſneſſe ſhall not want a reward; for <hi>God is not unrighteous to forget our worke and labour of love</hi> (Heb. 6.10.) that is, he will not let us goe without a reward for ſuch workes; for as then we are ſaid not to forget the word of God, when we obey it; ſo God is ſaid not to forget our workes when he doth reward them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This aſſures him that God will give teſtimony to his integrity, and beare his witnes (when moſt ſeaſonable) to his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous workes. Though men will not give him Teſtimony, yet God who knowes his wayes will; God will not doe leſſe for a good man then a good Conſcience will; For as an evill Conſcience will accuſe, ſo a good Conſcience will excuſe. (<hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15.) <hi>Their Conſciences in the meane time accuſing or excuſing one another.</hi> Conſcience knowes our wayes, and therefore Conſcience gives Teſtimony againſt them that doe evill, and Conſcience will give Teſtimony with thoſe that doe well: let all the world clamour againſt them, Conſcience will not, becauſe Conſcience knowes the way that a man takes. Much more then will God Teſtifie for that man whoſe way is good; and how ſweet is this! 'Tis ſweete and ſatisfying to a gracious ſoule to doe good, but when God himſelfe ſhall teſtifie for a gracious ſoule, that he hath done good, this is much more ſweete and ſatisfying. (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20, 21.) <hi>If our heart (or Conſcience) condemne us, he is greater then our heart (or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience) and knoweth all things. Beloved, if our heart condemne us
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:153845:202"/> not, then have we confidence toward God:</hi> even this confidence, that God will not onely not condemne us, but acquit us, yea and teſtifie for us; And as it is worſe to be condemned by God then by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſo it is better and ſweete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to be acquitted by God then by our owne Conſcience, when once our Conſciences are acquainted with his acquittall of us and teſtimony for us. Yea, there is this further Comfort in it, that for as much as our wayes are knowne to God, he will give teſtimony of them to others, as well as to our owne Conſciences. The world ſhall know what our wayes are one time or other, as well as God knowes them now: they who are moſt prejudiced againſt them, and draw the blackeſt lines over them, ſhall one day be made to know, that they did not know the beauty of them. And this God will doe; eyther</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In this world by ſome extraordinary providence; as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſpeakes (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.6.) <hi>Hee ſhall bring forth thy righteouſneſs as the light, and thy judgement as the noon day.</hi> A mans righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe may lye in obſcurity, or in the darke, no man knowing it, and moſt men judging him unrighteous, and wicked, but Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſome time or other will bring forth this mans righteouſnes as the light, and his juſt dealing as the noon day.</p>
                  <p>Or, Secondly, If a good mans wayes lye hid from the world all the dayes of his life in this world, yet the Apoſtle aſſures him, that in the <hi>great day</hi> God will proclaime them in the eares of all the world. (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5.) <hi>Judge nothing before the time, till the Lord come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darknes, and will make manifeſt the Councels of the heart.</hi> So then a day is coming which will make <hi>thorough lights</hi> in the world, and bring to light the moſt hidden things of the darkeſt darknes. And by <hi>theſe hidden things of darknes, and Counſels of the heart,</hi> wee are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not onely evill things, and wicked counſels (ſure enough God will bring them to light) but even thoſe righteous things, and good Councels of the heart, which have layne in the darke, or unrevealed: God will bring to light all the hidden things of darknes, the good as well as the bad, and then ſhall every man, that is, every good man, every godly man, have praiſe of God. The praiſe of man is very pleaſing unto man, but O how unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keably pleaſing is the praiſe of God! And this opens a vaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, between the hypocrite and the ſincere; Can a hypocrite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in ſecret, ſaying thus; God knoweth the way that I take?
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:153845:202"/> Hee cannot ſay thus; and I may ſay three things of the hypocrite in oppoſition to this.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The hypocrite endeavours to hide and put his wayes out of the ſight of God, as much as he can; As he hath not the light of Gods countenance, or of his favour ſhining upon him, ſo he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires not to have the light of his knowledge ſhining into him. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.15.) the Prophet deſcribes ſome <hi>ſeeking deep to hide their Councels from the Lord, and their workes are in the darke</hi> (both in natural and moral darknes) <hi>and they ſay, who ſeeth us, and who knoweth us?</hi> The endeavour of the hypocrite is that he may be hid. And</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>He cryes alls hid;</hi> as it is his endeavour, that God ſhould not, ſo it is his hope that God doth not know his wayes, much leſſe his heart; He is often ſure that men doe neither ſee nor know, &amp; he alwayes preſumes that God doth not; and therefore as one out of doubt he puts his doubts, <hi>who ſeeth? and who knoweth?</hi> Though flaſhes of feare come in upon him, ſometimes, yet he flatters himſelfe with preſumptious hopes and falſe perſwaſions, that God knowes him not, ſees him not, and that his dark way ſhall never be diſcovered; and as in that place of the Prophet, they ſpeake indefinitely, thereby inferring that God doth not ſee them; ſo wee have them in the Pſalme ſpeaking directly that God ſhall not. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.5, 6, 7.) <hi>They breake in pieces thy people O Lord, and ſlay the widdow and ſtranger, and murther the fatherles; yet they ſay, the Lord ſhall not ſee, neither ſhall the God of Jacob re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it;</hi> As if they had ſayd, though God ſhould ſet himſelfe to ſearch us out, and would never ſo faine ſee what we are doing, yet he ſhall not. We will carry it ſo cloſely and cunningly, that the eye of God ſhall not reach us. Their workes were ſo foule and bloody, that the Sunne might be aſhamed to looke upon them, and they were ſo cloſe that they beleeved God could not look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, or bring them to ſhame for them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, 'Tis a terror to an hypocrite to remember, that God knoweth his wayes. That which <hi>Job</hi> ſaith of the wicked in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, is moſt proper to hypocrites (<hi>Chap.</hi> 24.17.) <hi>The morning is to them even as the ſhadow of death; if one know them, they are in the terrours of the ſhadow of death.</hi> The Hebrew is very conciſe, <hi>if know;</hi> we make up the ſence thus, <hi>if one know them,</hi> that is, if God or man know them and their wayes, if they be apprehended
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:153845:203"/> and diſcovered, any way, in their abominable wayes, <hi>they are in the terrours of the ſhadow of death;</hi> that is, they are ready to dye with the fright and terror of it. Hypocrites are ſo farre from rejoycing in this, that God knowes the way which they take, that to be knowne eyther of God or man is their torment.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider why doth <hi>Job</hi> appeale to God in this Cauſe depending between him and his friends? The reaſon was, becauſe he knew his friends miſ-judged him through their ignorance; Therefore he deſiered to be heard by a Judge, that perfectly knew his wayes, and ſo was able to make a righteous judgement of him.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve;
<q>God is every way fitted to be a righteous Judge.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are two things eſpecially that fit a man, to be a Judge.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That he hath a principle of righteouſnes in him, that he be not byaſſed and turned aſide from doing right indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently without reſpect of perſons.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That he hath a principle of light in him, that he be (as <hi>Jethro</hi> adviſeth <hi>Moſes</hi>) a man of knowledge. Both theſe meete perfectly in God; He is juſt and righteous in all his wayes, and hee knowes all our wayes. Some Earthly Judges erre for want of a Principle of righteouſnes; and ſo in things which they plainely know and ſee as cleare as the light, are ready to be drawne and wrought off by reſpects and intereſts. Againe, there are other Earthly Judges, who are right and honeſt enough in their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, nothing can take them off, or miſlead them to the right hand or to the left, but they want knowledge and underſtanding to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne between good and evill, right &amp; wrong, they cannot ſee into the merit of the Cauſe, or the integrity of the perſon before them, and thereupon ſtumble in Judgement. Indeed the beſt of Earthly Judges cannot alwayes (when they have done their beſt) finde out who hath the good Cauſe, and who hath the bad; and many times they that plead blinde them with their Rhetorick, ſetting a faire gloſſe upon a foule Cauſe, or making a faire Cauſe looke foule, and ſo the Judge is deluded; ſeing he judgeth of things as witneſſed and repreſented, as alledged and legally proved, and ſo it may fall out that while he judgeth righteouſly, his judgement may not be right. But we (as <hi>Job</hi> here) have cauſe to rejoyce
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:153845:203"/> that we have to doe with a Judge, who as he is both righteous and knowing, ſo he knowes all things and perſons in themſelves, and not from others. <hi>He needs not that any ſhould teſtifie of man, for he knoweth what is in man</hi> (Joh. 2.25.) <hi>Hee knowes the way that is in me,</hi> or <hi>the way that I take:</hi> and as it followes;
<q>When he hath tryed mee I ſhall come forth as gold.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Broughton</hi> reads thus; <hi>Tryed he me I ſhould come forth Gold;</hi> that is, if God (as I deſire) would vouchſafe to try me, I ſhould appeare what I am indeed, not what I now appeare.</p>
                  <q>When he hath tryed mee.</q>
                  <p>There are divers wayes of tryall, three eſpecially; God tryes, firſt, by proſperity, that's a tryall; a full eſtate diſcovers a man, as well as a low and empty eſtate doth. To know how to abound is as high a poynt of grace as how to want (<hi>Phil.</hi> 4.12.) to have power in our hands, diſcovers us as well as to be oppreſt by power. <hi>Magiſtracy ſhewes the man, and it ſhewes many to be but men.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Magiſtratus indicat virum.</note> Great power over men is a great temptation to man, and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is the praiſe of men. (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.4.) <hi>But in all things appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our ſelves as the Miniſters of God in much patience, in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in neceſſities, in diſtreſſes,</hi> &amp;c. and by what elſe? <hi>by the Armour of righteouſneſs on the right hand, and on the left, by honour and diſhonour, by evill report and good report.</hi> We approve our ſelves, and tryall is taken of us as well by things on the right hand, as by thoſe upon the left, as well by honour, as by diſhonour. The good report or praiſe which a man meets with in the world is as great a tryal as the ill report or diſpraiſe which he meets with in the world; 'tis a great tryal to be diſpraiſed, to have dirt throwne in our faces, and it is a great tryal to be prais'd, to be commended, and applauded, to be lifted up in the thoughts &amp; upon the tongues of men. <hi>Solomon</hi> hath an excellent paſſage (<hi>Prov.</hi> 27.21.) <hi>As the fineing pot for ſilver, and the furnace for gold, ſo is a man to his praiſe;</hi> that is, a man is tryed by his praiſe, as the ſilver is tryed in the fineing pot, and as the gold is tryed in the furnace. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you are praiſed, you are tryed; Then your humility and ſelfe-denyall are tryed; Then you are tryed whether when you are praiſed by men, you can give the whole glory to God. <hi>Herods</hi> praiſe was the fineing pot, and the furnace wherein he was tryed,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:153845:204"/> it made him appeare to be but droſſe indeed. His hearers <hi>Cryed the voyce of God and not of man;</hi> When you cry up ſuch a Preacher, ſuch a Magiſtrate, ſuch a Souldier, ſuch an Oratour, you put him into the fineing pot, &amp; he that is but droſſe conſumes. <hi>The wormes eate up Herod, becauſe he gave not Glory to God</hi> (Act. 12.23.) As it was a moſt dreadfull, ſo it was a moſt righteous judgement, that he ſhould be eaten up of <hi>wormes,</hi> who forgot that he was <hi>one,</hi> and forgot it ſo farre that he was pleaſed with their applauſes, who cryed him up for a God. Worldly proſperity, power and praiſe are the <hi>right hand, way,</hi> by which God tryeth the ſonnes of men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God doth uſually try by affliction, and that's the <hi>left hand way. (James</hi> 1 12.) <hi>Bleſſed is the man that endureth temptation</hi> (meaning affliction) <hi>for when he is tryed he ſhall receive the crowne of life,</hi> &amp;c. That is, when thoſe temptations and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have tryed him, and he hath approved himſelfe in the tryall; then, <hi>he ſhall receive the crowne of life,</hi> &amp;c. (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6.) <hi>Though now for a ſeaſon (if need be) yee are in heavines through manifold temptations, that the tryal of your faith being much more precious then of gold that periſheth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cos aurum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat rectam ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamina men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. Natura vexata p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>though it be tryed with fire, might be found to praiſe,</hi> &amp;c. Affliction is the tryall of our faith in God, and of our patience under the hand of God. <hi>When nature is vext it ſhewes it ſelfe, and ſo doth grace. Affliction diſcovereth both what our vertues and what our corruptions are.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God tryeth man by a kinde of examination; <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes of that (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.3.) <hi>Thou haſt proved mine heart, thou haſt viſited mee in the night, thou haſt tryed mee and ſhalt finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> In the night the ſoule is free from buſines with the world, and therefore freeſt for buſines with God, &amp; then did God prove and viſit <hi>David,</hi> that is, examine and ſift him, by calling to his minde all his wayes and workes in former paſſages; And the iſſue of this tryall was, <hi>he found nothing,</hi> not that his ſoule was empty of good things, or that there was nothing evill in him, but God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on examination found nothing of that evill in him, which ſome men ſuſpected him of, Namely, eyther any ill will or evill deſigne againſt <hi>Saul,</hi> in reference to whom he called his cauſe a righteous cauſe, <hi>or the right</hi> (ver. 1.) <hi>Heare the right, O Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Thus God tryed <hi>David;</hi> And thus earthly Judges try men; They exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them, and their caſe, that's cald a tryall; in this third ſence
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:153845:204"/> wee are chiefly to underſtand the meaning of <hi>Job</hi> in this place. <hi>Job</hi> had long before undergone a tryall by proſperity and praiſe, <hi>Job</hi> was at that time under tryall by affliction, he had paſt the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and was under the latter, yea, he was deep in it,<note place="margin">Intelligitur de ſtricto dei exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in ſuo ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicio ad quod Job provocave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. <hi>Merc:</hi>
                     </note> but as yet hee had not come to this tryall of Examination, or to a judiciary try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, which hee earneſtly beggd of God. All men ſhall come to ſuch a tryall in <hi>the Great day. Wee muſt all appeare before the Judgement ſeate of Chriſt, that every one may receive the thingt done in his body, accordeng to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad</hi> (2 Cor. 5.10.) Some expound <hi>Job</hi> appealing here to that Judgement. But I conceive that the whole tendency of his diſcourſe aymes at an earlyer Judgement or day of tryall then that. And though (poſſibly) his expectation was not great, if any at all, that God would grant him a private Seſſion (as we may call it) for his perſonall tryall, yet (to ſhew that he had not the leaſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of being acquitted in that day whenſoever it ſhould be, he importunately profeſſeth he could wiſh it might be the next day, and that he would refuſe no paines nor travell, for the procuring of ſuch a day, were it to be obtained; being fully ſatisfied from the light and dictates of his owne Conſcience, that when the Lord had ſo tryed him, he (as <hi>David</hi> ſpake in the place lately opened) <hi>ſhould finde nothing,</hi> no ſuch fault or guilt as was charged upon him. Chriſt writing to the Angel of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> gives him this among other commendations, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2.) <hi>Thou hast tryed them which ſay they are Apoſtles and are not, and haſt found them lyars.</hi> Many appeare fayre in holines, and boaſt highly of their priviledges, (even as high as an infallible Spirit and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate miſſion) who yet being tryed and throughly examined by the Church, or by thoſe who are ſpirituall, and have ſences exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed to diſcerne both good and evill, will be found <hi>lyars,</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit ſtuffe, and lighter then vanitie. But <hi>Job</hi> was perſwaded that though God ſhould try him, not onely ſhould nothing be found againſt him, nor he found a lyar, but that much would be found for him, and himſelfe be found in the truth, as he plainely expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in the cloſe of the verſe; <hi>when hee hath tryed mee,</hi> whut then?</p>

So (<hi>Jer.</hi> 51.7.) <hi>Babylon hath been a golden Cup in the hand of the Lord;</hi> Which ſome expound tropically; taking the Continent for the thing contained; The cup for the wine, <hi>Called golden wine,</hi> becauſe of the ſplendidnes and beauty of it (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Pro.</hi> 23.31.) <hi>When it giveth his colour in the cup.</hi> Or <hi>Babylon</hi> is called a <hi>Golden cup;</hi> firſt, becauſe of the great glory, wealth, and illuſtrious pomp of that Empire, deſcribed in <hi>Daniel</hi> (Chap. 2.32.38.) by <hi>a head of Gold,</hi> and marked out in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> by the name of the <hi>Golden City</hi> (Iſa. 14.4) and ſecondly, becauſe God had cauſed other Nations to drinke deep of his wrath by the power of the Babylonian Empire.

Whether it be the fire of perſecution, tribulation, and temptation (nothing but holy truth can abide theſe fires) or the fire of the holy Spirit (who in Scripture is often compared to fire, and) who together with the light of the Word revealeth the ſoundnes or falſenes of all doctrines delivered by men, and like fire conſumes what is falſe, but gives a further brightnes and luſtre to the truth. Even truth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryed may be counted droſſe, but being tryed it comes forth like gold. Now, as the truth of doctrines, ſo the truth of perſons, in their workes and graces will abide when they come to the Teſt or tryall; God who puts away all the wicked of the earth as droſſe, will gather up all the godly of the earth as Gold, when he hath tryed them, and try them he will. We read (<hi>Dan.</hi> 7.9, 10.) how dreadfully God comes to Judgement; <hi>I beheld till the thrones were caſt downe, and the ancient of dayes did ſit; his Throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheeles as burning fire; a fiery ſtreame iſſued and came forth from before him, the judgement was ſet, and the bookes were opened.</hi> Which whether it be meant of the laſt Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or of ſome ſpeciall Judgement upon a particular ſtate or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:153845:206"/> power, comes all to one as to the poynt in hand; while it ſhewes that God in the tryal of men will examine their perſons, and their actions, as by fire. Of every ſuch tryall it may be ſayd (as <hi>Mala.</hi> 3.2, 3.) <hi>Who may abide the day of his coming? and who ſhall ſtand when he appeareth?</hi> (The Prophet ſpeakes of the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh, at which time he was alſo mighty in Spirit) <hi>for he is like a refiners fire, and like fullers ſoape, and he ſhall ſit as a refiner and purifier of ſilver.</hi> When Chriſt came in the fleſh to redeeme us, he came with fire alſo to purge and ſanctifie us, and he comes with fire whenſoever he comes in the Spirit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and enlighten us, and at laſt when he comes in glory, he will come with fire to try, examine, and judge us. When he comes to try us thus, All the faithfull ſhall come forth as Gold, but the wicked and their works will burne and be conſumed. When Saints come to tryal at laſt they will ſtand, and when they are tryed here, they will mend; firſt, their Corruptions will be the more outed, and, ſecondly, their graces will be the more acted. We may read this iſſue of their tryal (<hi>Zech.</hi> 13.9.) <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe that in all the Land, ſaith the Lord, two parts therein ſhall be cut off and dye, but the third ſhall be left therein.</hi> Whether we take <hi>the Land</hi> in particular for <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the people of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> or typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, for all profeſſors thorowout the world, <hi>two parts ſhall be cut off and dye, but the third ſhall be left therein.</hi> And what will God doe with them? or how will he deale with them? We may ſee what at the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe. <hi>And I will bring the third part thorow the fire</hi> (of affliction and examination) <hi>and I will refine them as ſilver is refined, and try them as gold is tryed</hi> (and what will be the iſſue of this?) <hi>And they ſhall call on my name, and I will heare them.</hi> Here faith and prayer (in which all graces are exerciſed) are put for all graces.

                     </gap>, we ſhall ſee what an anſwer there is in them as to this poynt. At the firſt verſe <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>O Lord, thou haſt ſearched mee and knowne mee:</hi> at the 23 verſe hee prayes; <hi>Search mee O God, and know my heart;</hi> why did <hi>David</hi> pray thus to God; <hi>Search mee and know my heart?</hi> having ſaid before, <hi>Thou haſt ſearched mee and knowne mee.</hi> Seing <hi>David</hi> knew that God had ſearched him, what needed he to pray that God would ſearch him? why did he begge God to doe that which hee had done already? The anſwer is at hand. <hi>David</hi> was a diligent ſelfe-ſearcher, and therefore he was ſo willing to be ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, yea he delighted to be ſearched, by God; and that not (as was ſaid) becauſe himſelfe had done it already, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew God could doe it better. Hee knew by his owne ſearch, that he did not live in any way of wickednes againſt his knowledge, and yet he knew there might be ſome way of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in him that he knew not of. And therefore he doth not onely ſay, <hi>Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts;</hi> but he adds (<hi>ver.</hi> 24.) <hi>ſee if there be any wicked way</hi> (or <hi>any way of paine and griefe) in me.</hi> (The ſame word ſignifies
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:153845:207"/> both, becauſe wicked wayes lead in the end to paine and griefe) <hi>and lead me in the way everlaſting.</hi> As if he had ſaid; Lord, I have ſearched my ſelfe, and can ſee no wicked way in me, but Lord thy ſight is infinitely clearer then mine, and if thou wilt but ſearch me, thou mayeſt ſee ſome wicked way in me which I could not ſee, and I would faine ſee and know the worſt of my ſelfe, that I might amend it and grow better, therefore Lord, if there be any ſuch way in me, cauſe me to know it alſo; O take that way out of me, and take me out of that way, <hi>lead me in the way everlaſting. David</hi> had tryed himſelfe, and he would againe be tryed by God, that he being better tryed, might become yet better. He found himſelfe Gold upon his owne tryall, and yet he feared there might be ſome droſſe in him that he had not found, And now he would be re-tryed that he might come forth pureſt gold. Pure gold feares neither the furnace nor the fire, neither the Teſt nor the Touchſtone, nor is weighty gold afraid of the Ballance; He that is weight will be weight, how often ſoever he is weighed: he that is gold will be gold, how often ſoever he is tryed, and the oftener he is tryed the purer Gold he will be; what he is he will be, and he would be better then he is. Every man of <hi>Jobs</hi> mettal ſaith or may ſay, <hi>Let him try mee, and I ſhall come forth as gold.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, For thoſe ſteps which God hath appointed man to take,<note place="margin">Veſtigia dei i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem ſignificare, poterunt quod via dei, <hi>ſc.</hi> illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us precepta &amp; legem, quam no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis tenendam commonſtrat. <hi>Pined.</hi> Greſſum ejus accipe paſſivè id eſt ab eo defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum &amp; mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratum. <hi>Jun.</hi> Veſtigia dei ſunt divinae a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiones quibus ille preit; vel ſunt ejus effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus ad extra, <hi>ſc.</hi> Charitatis, clementiae, ju<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtitiae veritatis. <hi>Pined.</hi>
                     </note> walking as and where God would have him; ſo theſe ſteps are the ſame with the law or way of God: not actively for the ſteps which God takes, but paſſively for the ſteps which he directs and appoints us to take.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may expound theſe ſteps for Gods own ſteps, not for the ſteps which he ſhews us in his word that we ſhould take, but for the ſteps which he ſhews in his practiſe, or in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample that himſelfe hath taken. <hi>My foote hath held his ſteps;</hi> ſo to follow the ſteps of another is to imitate him, and to follow the ſteps of God is to imitate him; the ſteps of God are thoſe holy actings wherein he goeth before us, and ſets us an example. Some of the workes of God are a rule, his actions are directions to us. Then <hi>Jobs</hi> meaning is, I have imitated God, and followed his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:153845:209"/> in all things that are imitable by man, I have ſo much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted my ſelfe with God, and have been ſo familiar with him that I have as it were coppied out his way in my life and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Thus he ſpeakes of God as leading the way, and going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us; and (ſaith he) I have not ſatisfied my ſelfe to follow him at large, or in the ſame common path, but I have ſet my feete in his very ſteps, or I have followed him ſtep by ſtep.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>That a godly man doth example himſelfe by God.</q>
                  <p>He followeth the way of God in his workes, as well as in his word, or he obeyeth God doing as well as commanding. Many of the workes of God are infinitely beyond our imitation, yet he workes ſo in other things that he hath deſcended to our imitation. And though we cannot follow God in any thing as to an equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet we may follow him in many things as to the ſimilitude of his workings; we may goe the ſame way that he goeth, and take the ſame ſteps that he hath taken, though we cannot take them in that perfection, nor goe with ſuch exactnes as he hath gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us. A childe may write the ſame letters, the ſame words and lines, which the moſt acurate penman or artiſt in writing hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed him for a copie, and ſo the childe may be ſaid to hold the ſteps of his Maſter, letter for letter, word for word, line for line, though there be a wide difference diſcernable between their writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. To follow God is our dutie, <hi>Godlineſſe is Godlikeneſſe,</hi> or, <hi>an imitation of God, And practicall Chriſtianity is nothing elſe but our imitation of Chriſt,</hi> and that not onely in doing but in ſuffering (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21.) <hi>For even hereunto are we called; becauſe Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an example that we ſhould follow his ſteps.</hi>

                     </note> Chriſt is not onely a principle of holineſſe in us, or our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life, but he is alſo a patterne of holineſſe according to which we ought to live. And the ſame Apoſtle repreſents the holineſſe of God, both as a rule, and as a motive of that holineſſe which ſhould be acted by us (1 <hi>Ep:</hi> 1.15, 16.) <hi>As he that hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of converſation,</hi> becauſe it is written (<hi>Lev:</hi> 11.14.) <hi>Be ye holy for I am holy.</hi> To be holy <hi>as God is</hi> in all manner of converſation, is ſtedfaſtly to hold the ſteps of God. And when (as Chriſt exhorts <hi>Math.</hi> 5.55.) <hi>Wee are mercifull as our father which is in heaven is mercifull.</hi> When as
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:153845:209"/> the Apoſtle exhorts (<hi>Eph.</hi> 4.32.) <hi>Wee forgive as God for Chriſts ſake hath forgiven us;</hi> when we are patient and long-ſuffering one towards another, as God is towards us all, then we take hold of his ſteps; this ſhould be our buſineſſe every day, to follow God in his word, and in his workes, <hi>to follow him fully.</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leb (Num.</hi> 14.24.) <hi>My ſervant Caleb hath another ſpirit, he hath followed me fully.</hi> Here ſome may object, to follow the counſel of God fully, is the dutie of all, but to follow the example of God is ſurely beyond the attainment of any. This ſeemes to be a hight of holineſſe too high for man; For if <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid (<hi>Eccl:</hi> 2.12.) <hi>What can the man doe that cometh after the King? even that which hath been already done,</hi> or (more cloſe to the Original) <hi>in thoſe things which have been already done.</hi> How much more may we ſay, What can the man doe that comes after God the King of Kings? can he doe that which hath been done already? I anſwer, no man can paralel the workes of God, but all men are called to imitate him in his workes; though we cannot follow him with equall ſteps, yet we may follow the equity and holines of his ſteps. This <hi>Job</hi> did and we (through grace) may doe. <hi>My foote hath held his ſteps,</hi>
                     <q>His way have I kept, and not declined.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The way of God is his Law, in that he will have us to walke, and that is called <hi>his way,</hi> becauſe he hath preſcribed it, and is the author of it; as that is mans way wherein he walks, ſo that is Gods way wherein he will have man to walke; <hi>Bleſſed is the undefiled in the way</hi> (Pſal. 119.1.) What the way is, he tels us in the next words, <hi>Bleſſed are they that keepe his teſtimonies, and who walke in the Law of the Lord.</hi> His law and teſtimonies are his way: now ſayth <hi>Job, As I have held his ſteps,</hi> or followed his example, ſo <hi>I have kept his way,</hi> that is, I have done that which he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. The way of God is put ſometimes in Scripture for that which himſelfe hath done (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.25.<note place="margin">Via del &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis ſumitur; <hi>1</hi> Pro itinere &amp; greſſibus. <hi>2</hi> P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And as the workes of providence, ſo the worke of Creation is called the way of God (<hi>Pro.</hi> 8.22.) <hi>The Lord poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed me in the beginning of his way,</hi> (that is, before he came forth in the worke of Creation) <hi>before his workes of old;</hi> his way and his workes are the ſame, or his workes are his way. But in this Text
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:153845:210"/> (as I touch't before) we may rather take <hi>way</hi> for that which God would have us doe, or for the way in which we ought to walke. And ſo we have the compleatnes of <hi>Jobs</hi> obedience, he imitated the example and he obeyed the command of God.</p>
                  <q>His way have I kept.</q>
                  <p>Yet further, There is a twofold keeping of the way of God;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by practice and obedience, thus we keepe the way of God by ſubmitting to it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a keeping the way of God by protection and defence; Thus we keepe the way of God, when we ſtand up to maintaine it. We may take it here in both ſenſes; and in both, doubtleſſe, <hi>Jobs</hi> Spirit was led out to <hi>keepe the way of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>A godly man keepes cloſe to the word of God.</q>
                  <p>He keepes cloſe to it by obeying it, and he keepes it cloſe by defending it; and this he doth as <hi>Job</hi> did it univerſally (for ſo this indefinite propoſition, <hi>His way have I kept,</hi> is to be underſtood) it was not this or that way, but any or every way of God which he kept. And thus a godly man keepes the way of God, though it be a difficult and (to the fleſh) an uneaſie way, though it be (among men) a reproachfull, and ignominious way, though it be (as to his outward concernements) a diſadvantageous and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous way, yet he keepes it: he that is through with God, doth not onely keepe thoſe wayes which ſuit with his owne pleaſure and credit, with the ſafety of his owne intereſts and accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the world, but if the way of God lie through difficulties, through dangers and diſgraces, he will yet keepe it. And if we thus keepe the way of God, we may be ſure, that the way of God, or rather the God of this way will keepe us, and keepe us in perfect peace, in ſpirituall freedome, ſafetie, and honour, though we have trouble in and from the world. <hi>His way have I kept,</hi> and which doth heighten his obedience, care, and zeale in keeping it.</p>

There is a twofold declining. Firſt, a declining from the way of God to evill and ſinfull wayes; and theſe are of two ſorts, firſt, erroneous opinions; ſecondly, wicked practices; ſecondly, there is a declining in the way of God, when though we keepe the good way, yet we are not ſo good in the way as we were, but ſlacke our pace &amp; coole in our zeale to the good wayes of God. We may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound <hi>Jobs</hi> negative in reference to both theſe; as if he had ſayd, I have neither gone out of the way of God, nor have I been ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in it. 'Tis the higheſt commendation of man, thus to keepe the way of God, <hi>and not decline.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>A godly man is, or ought to be, and 'tis his honour to be ſteady in a good way.</q>
                  <p>Perfeverance is our Crowne. The Apoſtle (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58.) <hi>Exhorts to be ſteady and unmoveable, alwayes abounding in the worke of the Lord.</hi> We ſhould be alwayes moving in the worke of the Lord, but never moving out of the worke of the Lord: wee ſhould be as a rock in regard of ſtedfaſtnes, and as fire in regard of activenes. The Author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> (Chap. 10.23.) gives this admonition to beleivers, <hi>Let us hold faſt the profeſſion of our faith, without wavering,</hi> or without declining. There are ſome of whom we may ſay, they hold nothing, they hold no profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they dare not make a profeſſion leſt they ſhould be bound to ſtand to it, or they ſtand not to that which they have made; and as they hold no profeſſion, ſo they hold no poſition, but as to the doctrine of faith are meere ſcepticks, they are alwayes que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, but never concluding. The Apoſtle ſpeakes of ſome (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.7.) <hi>who are ever learning, but never able to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth;</hi> and there are others ever learning, but never willing to declare their knowledge of the truth; and they who hold nothing in doctrine, will not hold long in practice. Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle; <hi>Let us hold faſt our profeſſion,</hi> let us be ſteady in it, and that without wavering. And this is the great argument which the Apoſtle carries through that whole Epiſtle, to eſtabliſh the Saints, that ſo they might hold faſt, without wavering, and
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:153845:211"/> declining in the profeſſion of the faith. Let us take heed of eyther of thoſe waverings and declineings, before explained. Firſt, Let us not decline in the way, but keepe up in the ſame degree of holines and love to Chriſt. The Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> is charged with this ſort of declineing; and therefore after Chriſt had given that Church a great and a deſerved commendation (<hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2.) <hi>I know thy workes, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canſt not beare them which are evill, and haſt tryed them that ſay they are Apoſtles, and are not, and haſt found them lyars;</hi> yet Chriſt comes with a <hi>rebuking, nevertheleſſe</hi> (at the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe) <hi>I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what againſt thee, becauſe thou haſt left thy firſt love;</hi> that is, <hi>thou haſt declined</hi> from, or abated in thy firſt heate of love. <hi>Epheſus</hi> did not totally forſake, nor caſt off Chriſt out of her love; <hi>Epheſus</hi> did not chooſe other lovers, nor ſay, ſhee would have no more to doe with Chriſt: The chiefe object of her love was the ſame, but her actings were not the ſame. The ſtreames of her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection did not run into another channel, but they were fallen and ebb'd in their former channel. 'Tis ſad, when Saints decline thus; we ſhould keepe up to the ſame height, to the ſame heate, to the ſame degree of love without declineing, we ſhould not onely run at firſt ſetting out, but continue running, or as the Apoſtle ſpeakes (<hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1.) <hi>Run with patience,</hi> that is, run conſtantly, or with perſeverance, <hi>the race that is ſet before us.</hi> They that run in a worldly race, the neerer they come to the Goale, the faſter they run, and the more they ſtrive; ſo ſhould we in our holy race; we ſhould ſtill be growing and <hi>encreaſing with the encreaſe of God.</hi> A Saint ſhould be thankfull for the leaſt degree, but he ſhould not ſit downe in the greateſt degree he hath already attained unto. And though ſome who have grace doe not actually reach after more, yet they who ſay they have enough, or need no more, give too cleare an evidence againſt themſelves, that they have none at all. As the higher degrees of grace (under a temptation or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion) may be unthriving and unſtriving after perfection, ſo the loweſt degree of ſaving grace is (in its owne nature) thriving and ſtriving after more perfection. He that beleeves, truely, would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve more, and he that loves truely, would love more and more, till his love become a vehement flame, ſo vehement a flame that many waters ſhall not be able to quench it, nor the floods (of trouble and perſecution from the world) drowne it.</p>
                  <pb n="395" facs="tcp:153845:211"/>
                  <p>Secondly, as we ſhould thus take heed of declining in the way of grace, ſo we ſhould much more take heed, that we decline not from the way of grace, or as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> expreſſeth it (2 <hi>Ep:</hi> 2.31.) <hi>that we turne not from the holy commandement delivered unto us.</hi> This declining or turning from the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is twofold; firſt, to the right hand; ſecondly, and to the left. The Scripture gives warning againſt both (<hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.7.) <hi>Be thou ſtrong and very corragious, that thou mighteſt obſerve, and doe according to all the Law which Moſes commanded, turne not from it to the right hand, or to the left.</hi> Againe (<hi>Pro.</hi> 4.25, 26, 27.) <hi>Let thine eye look right on, and let thine eye-lids look ſtreight before thee; ponder the path of thy feete, and let all thy wayes be eſtabliſhed, turne not to the right hand, nor to the left, remove thy foote from evill;</hi> As if he had ſayd, there is evill both on the right hand, and on the left, therefore turne neyther to the one, nor to the other, that thou mayeſt <hi>remove thy foot from evill.</hi> But ſome may ſay, What is here meant by the right hand, and what by the left? and what are theſe declineings, or turnings? I anſwer; To turne <hi>to the right hand,</hi> notes exceſſe, when we will take upon us to doe more then God hath commanded, when we will needs over-doe, this is to decline to the right hand; for though, when man hath done his utmoſt through grace in this life (conſidering his in dwelling corruption) he alwayes falls ſhort of that exactnes which the Law requires, and ſo cannot poſſibly exceed the Law in holines; yet all they may be ſaid to act beyond the command, or to out-act the Law of God, as to the matter of their obedience, who doe that which God never commanded, nor ever <hi>came into his heart</hi> (as the Prophet ſpeakes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.31.) to command them. They who thus doe what God requires not, and as if God had been too ſcant in his rules, will needes give a new rule eyther to themſelves or others, and as if God had not given them lawes enow, will (in this ſence) be a law to themſelves or others, eyther in matters of practiſe or worſhip (And ſo indeed make voyd the Law of God by their tradition) theſe exceeders are the men who turne to the right hand, though indeed (except they repent this raſhneſſe) themſelves are likely to be ſet upon the left hand. Men never act more left-handedly then when they thus turne to the right hand, nor doe they ever wrong God more, then when they doe that which is right in their owne eyes: men never ſhew themſelves
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:153845:212"/> ſo fooliſh, as when they will be wiſer then God.</p>
                  <p>Againe, Declining or turning to the left hand, implyeth a ſinne in defect, when we doe leſſe then God commands, when we ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and ſtreighten the will of God in our obedience to it. Every naturall man thinkes a little much, yea he thinkes much to doe a little; and may therefore be ſayd to turne to the left hand, becauſe that is the unworking hand, or the hand which doth the leaſt work. A natural man eyther makes the Law of God voyd by doing that which is againſt it, or he lets it lie voyd by not doing it, and would be glad that this talent committed to him might for ever be wrapt up in a napkin, or be buryed in the earth. Both theſe turnings, whether to the right hand, or to the left, are evill. The way of holines, the good way lieth ſtreight forward, right on; It hath no turning either to the right hand, nor to the left. All the wayes of ſinne are called <hi>crooked wayes,</hi> and they are our owne wayes. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.5.) <hi>As for ſuch as turne aſide to their crooked wayes, the Lord ſhall lead them forth with the workers of iniquitie.</hi> The Pſalmiſt calls them, <hi>Their crooked wayes;</hi> that is, wayes of their own deviſing; whereas the way of holines is the Lords way. To exceed or to doe more, to be deficient or to doe leſſe then God requires, both theſe are crooked wayes; the way of the Lord lyes ſtreight forward, right before us. (<hi>Pro.</hi> 28.18.) <hi>Who ſo walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vprightly ſhall be ſaved, but he that is perverſe (or crooked) in his wayes ſhall fall at once.</hi> The motion of a godly man is like that of the kine that carryed the Arke (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.12.) <hi>Who tooke the ſtreight way to the way of Bethſhemeſh, and went along the high way, lowing as they went, and they turned not aſide to the right hand, or to the left.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, Doe not good men, even the beſt of good men, decline ſometimes, and goe aſide? or doth it argue every man to be wicked who declines at any time? I anſwer; <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes of what he had not done, not of what it was impoſſible for him to doe; he had not declined, yet he might have declined. Wee finde many declinings among the godly; how many are there that decline in degrees, who are godly in the maine; They love ſtill, but they have not the ſame warmth of love, the ſame heate of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; They obey ſtill, but they have not the ſame ſtrength of obedience. There may be a declineing alſo not onely in the way, but from the way, to the right hand ſometimes, and ſometimes to
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:153845:212"/> the left; there may be an exceeding, and there may be a coming ſhort in thoſe, as to actions, who, as to their ſtate, are come home to God; theſe things are poſſible, yea common, but we ſpeake of what many godly men doe, and what ſhould be the aime, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of every godly man, that is, to keepe the way of God, and not to decline, to keepe himſelfe up in ſpirituall ſtrength, and to keepe himſelfe onne in a ſpirituall courſe; yea every godly man may, and can ſay as <hi>David</hi> did (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.21,) <hi>I have kept the wayes of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</hi> Though every godly man cannot ſay as godly <hi>Job</hi> did, <hi>I have kept his way, and not declined,</hi> yet every godly man may ſay as <hi>David, I have kept his wayes, and have not wickedly departed from my God;</hi> we ſhould be afraid of declineing and decaying, we ſhould ſtrive to be alwayes advancing and encreaſing. And as Saints are under a command to be ſuch, ſo they are under a promiſe to be ſuch, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.12, 13, 14.) <hi>The righteous ſhall flouriſh like a Palme tree: he ſhall grow like a Cedar in Libanon. Thoſe that be planted in the houſe of the Lord, ſhall flouriſh in the Courts of our God, they ſhall ſtill bring forth fruit in old age: they ſhall be fat and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Here is not onely a mention of growing, but of flouriſhing, and here's flouriſhing three times mentioned, and 'tis growing and flouriſhing not onely like a tree, but like a Palme-tree, (which flouriſheth under opreſſion) and like a Cedar (not growing in ordinary places, but) in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> where were the goodlieſt Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars. Nor doth the Spirit promiſe here a flouriſhing in boughes ane leaves onely (as ſome trees doe, and doe no more) but in fruit; And this not onely fruit for once in a yeare, or one yeare, but they <hi>ſtill bring forth fruit,</hi> and that not onely in the yeares of their youth, or beginnings in grace, but <hi>in old age,</hi> and that not only in the entrance of that ſtate which is called <hi>old age,</hi> threeſcore yeares, but that which the Scripture calls the perfection of <hi>old age,</hi> threeſcore yeares and ten, as the learned Hebrewes obſerve upon the word uſed in the Pſalme. What a <hi>divine climax</hi> doth the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God make in this Scripture, to ſhew that the godly man, as to his ſtate, is ſo farre from declining, that he is ſtill climbing high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and higher? And if any ſhall aske how comes it to paſſe then, that ſome godly men are obſerved not onely by themſelves, but by others, to decline often in and ſometimes from the wayes of God?</p>
                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:153845:213"/>
                  <p>I anſwer, theſe declinings may be aſſigned to ſeverall Cauſes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To the power of ſome Corruption remaining much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified in them; as in a garden when the weeds grow high, the good herbs decline; And as in a field, when the weeds are ſtrong, the corne is weake; ſo it is here; the prevailing or grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Corruption, is the declining of Grace in degree, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it, ſome (for a time) decline from the way.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Declinings are from the prevalency of temptation; while Satan plieth ſome with temptation, he turneth them out of the way, or cauſeth them to walke but ſlowly in it. As temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a tryall of, ſo a hindrance unto grace, yea though corruption be kept much downe, yet ſome through a violent guſt of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have been over-borne.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Declinings are cauſed in the good by the example of thoſe that are evill, therefore the Apoſtle gives that Caution (<hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2.) <hi>Not to be conformable to the world.</hi> A godly man is apt enough to write by a falſe copie, and to doe as he ſees the world doth. What was all their way, or their onely way before converſion, they after converſion (through neglect of their watch) may be found ſtepping into, or taking a ſtep or two in. Before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion our whole courſe, ſayth the Apoſtle (<hi>Ephe.</hi> 2.2.) <hi>is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the courſe of this world;</hi> And the examples of the world have drawne many aſide, after they have come out from the world. The faſhions and vanities of the world, in pride and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, are very drawing. All examples, eſpecially evill examples (like the Loadſtone) have an attractive vertue in them; and many of the godly have been drawne aſide thus, and have declined, with much ſcandal, fot a while from the way of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Declinings are ſometimes from afflictions; and thoſe we may conſider of two ſorts, perſonall, or publique: both or ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe have cauſed many to decline. The cold froſt of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction hath nipped the graces of ſome, and made them to turn aſide from the way of God. Therefore the Church (having reported her great troubles) ſpeakes it as an argument of much ſinceritie towards God, and ſtrength of Grace received from him. (<hi>Pſal</hi> 44.17, 18.) <hi>All this is come upon us</hi> (that is, all theſe common cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and afflictions) <hi>yet have we not forgotten thee, nor dealt falſely in thy Covenant; our hearts are not turned back, neither are our ſteps declined from thy way;</hi> As if ſhe had ſaid, Theſe afflictions
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:153845:213"/> have been ſtrong temptations upon us to cauſe us to decline from thy wayes, but through grace we have kept our ground, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained conſtant in thy Covenant, <hi>yea though thou haſt ſore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the ſhadow of death.</hi> As, many, yea moſt of the Saints have improved under the croſſe, ſo there have been ſome who either through their preſent unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, or forgetfulnes of <hi>the exhortation which</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5.) <hi>ſpeaketh unto them as unto children,</hi> have had their faintings and declinings under it.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Others decline through proſperitie, and worldly injoyments; when they grow rich in temporalls, they grow poorer in ſpiritualls. As their outward man encreaſeth, ſo their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner man decayeth; and as they flouriſh in the fleſh, ſo hey wither in ſpirit. Hence holy <hi>Agur</hi> prayed (<hi>Pro.</hi> 30.8, 9.) <hi>Give me not poverty, leaſt I be poore and ſteale, and take the name of God in vaine,</hi> (that would be a ſad declining) <hi>give me not riches, leſt I be full and deny thee, and ſay who is the Lord?</hi> That's a ſadder declining then the former. Povertie endangers grace much, but riches more. To be rich or great in the world, is a great temptation; <hi>Food con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient</hi> is the moſt ſweet and moſt untemptationleſſe condition. As hypocrites fall quite off from God, when they come onne much in the world; ſo the ſincere may be much hindred in their way. And as many godly men have declined through their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie, ſo ſome have declined, or at leaſt have been in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of declining by the proſperitie of others. <hi>David</hi> was readie to decline from God, when he ſaw the proſperitie of ungodly men. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.2.) <hi>As for me my feete were almoſt gone, my ſteps had well nigh ſlip't, when I ſaw the proſperitie of the wicked. David</hi> was almoſt downe, when he ſaw the wicked up Their ſtanding had almoſt given him a fall; <hi>My ſteps</hi> (ſayth h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>had well nigh ſlipt;</hi> now if it put <hi>David,</hi> a man eminent in godlineſſe, ſo hard to it to keepe his ſtanding (all the grace in his heart, and aſſiſtance from God could ſcarce hold him up) how much more may they who come farre ſhort of <hi>David,</hi> decline by ſeing the proſperitie of wicked men? are not they readie to conclude, ſurely we ſhall thrive, and doe well enough, though we doe as others doe, who doe not trouble themſelves in a ſtrictnes about matters of religion as we have done, <hi>Verily</hi> (as it follows at the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe) <hi>we have cleanſed our heart in vaine, and waſhed our hands in innocency.</hi>
                     <pb n="400" facs="tcp:153845:214"/> If we had ſpared our paines of labour, we could not have endured more paine of trouble; <hi>for all the day long have we been plagued, and chaſtned every morning.</hi> Such arguings as theſe ſhew great declinings. Yet they who are ſincere will ſoone recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againe, and ſay as <hi>David</hi> after he had reviewed this Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation (<hi>ver.</hi> 15.) <hi>If we ſay we will ſpeake thus, we ſhould offend againſt the Generation of the righteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now ſeing the Godly are ſo many wayes endangered to decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, let us be warned of it, and beware of it. Theſe are declining times, many profeſſors have ſhamed themſelves, and the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpel. He is a Chriſtian indeed that can ſay in truth as <hi>Job</hi> did, <hi>I have kept his words and not declined;</hi> they that knew me many yeares agoe may finde me in as good, yea in a better plight then I was then. Hypocrites &amp; true beleevers may look &amp; act very like one another, but as the nature of their eſtates have alwayes a vaſt difference to the underſtanding, ſo the event gives a vaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them to the eye. Hypocrites keep the word of God a while, but they ever decline in the end finally from it, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims throw it off in the way totally. When they are in the way they grow weary of it, &amp; a ſmal matter working either upon their hopes or fears, will put them quite out of it. Every difficulty, every danger is to them a Lion in the way, cauſing them to decline from it; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as to thoſe that are ſincere, difficulties are not ſtops, but incitements and ſpurres, they doe but provoke their zeale, they cannot quench it. And hence the holy Apoſtle ſends a challenge (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35.) to all the troubles, afflictions, and evills in the world: he bids them doe their worſt, and when they have done it, they ſhall not be <hi>able to ſeperate him from the love of God,</hi> neither from the love wherewith Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <q>That ſinne is a declining from the way of God.</q>
                  <p>That's the Apoſtles definition (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.4.) <hi>Sin is the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law;</hi> And tranſgreſſion is a going aſide, or a going over the line by which God hath chaulked us out our way. God hath not left us at our liberty, though he hath left us (as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> calls it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.25.) <hi>a perfect law of liberty.</hi> He
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:153845:214"/> hath not left us to travell over hedge and ditch, but hath ſhewed us our way, <hi>a high way and a way</hi> (as the Prophet ſpeakes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.8.) <hi>And it ſhall be called the way of holines, the way-faring men, though fooles, ſhall not erre therein.</hi> Yet fooles are alwayes erring from it, all their walkings are wandrings, and their goings are goings aſtray who walke and goe on in a ſinfull way. The word which ſignifies ſinne in the Hebrew, imports moſt properly the miſſing of a mark; becauſe ſinning is a miſſing of the mark, and a declining from the way; <hi>I have kept his way, and not declined.</hi>

                     <hi>neither have I gone backe from his commandement;</hi> I have kept cloſe to it without the leaſt willing declenſion. I have not layd the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement out of my hand, much leſſe have I put it out of my heart.

<pb n="402" facs="tcp:153845:215"/> and reſolvedly.</hi> The Scripture is full of ſuch negatives. Thus when the Lord makes that promiſe (<hi>Joel</hi> 2.26.) <hi>My people ſhall never be aſhamed;</hi> It ſeemes to be but a ſmall matter, that the people of God ſhall not be aſhamed, but the meaning is, they ſhall be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honoured, they ſhall have a name and reputation in the world, they ſhall make their boaſt in &amp; of me their God all the day long. So when the Apoſtle gives that negative counſel; (1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.18.) <hi>Deſpiſe not propheſie,</hi> his purpoſe is to exhort the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> and us in them to the readieſt embraces and higheſt eſtimations of it. Not to deſpiſe, is to <hi>honour propheſie,</hi> that is, the preaching of the word in a due expoſition and application of it to <hi>exhortation, and edification and comfort.</hi> So then, there is much more in theſe words, <hi>I have not gone backe from the commandement;</hi> then thus, I have not turned, or apoſtatized from the commandement, I have not throwne up, nor abjured my profeſſion; <hi>Jobs</hi> meaning is, <hi>I have kept ſtrictly and firmely to it, I have aſſerted it, and affirmed it, and will maintaine it to the end:</hi> as I have hitherto lived, ſo I am purpoſed to dye in the obedience of it. <hi>I have not gone backe from the commandement of his lips.</hi> We finde the word uſed in ſuch a ſignification (<hi>Prov.</hi> 17.13.) <hi>Who ſo rewardeth evill for good, evill ſhall not depart from his houſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Semper fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liariter in illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us domo verſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur.</note> or, <hi>evill ſhall not goe backe from his houſe.</hi> As evill ſhall come, ſo evill ſhall not goe backe, he ſhall not be able to diſmiſſe it when it cometh; evill ſhall keepe cloſe to his houſe, dwell and abide in his houſe, or hang upon him like an unwelcome gueſt, he ſhall not get it out for ever.

                  <p>Yet further, that which before, he called <hi>the way of God,</hi> here he calls <hi>the commandement of his lips;</hi> lips are the inſtruments of ſpeech.

God is the onely Law-giver, and we muſt receive the Law from his mouth. He that will pleaſe God, muſt ſhutt all his own imaginations out of doores, and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe with them; 'Tis not what man hath a minde to doe, but what the minde of God is he ſhould doe, that pleaſeth him, or is eyther a worſhip or a ſervice acceptable to him. We never diſhonour God more then when we take upon us to ſerve him our owne way, and leaving his rule make a rule for our ſelves. Such a ſerving of God is rebellion againſt him; as was told <hi>Saul</hi> by the Prophet (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.22.) <hi>Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings, and ſacrifices, as in obeying the voyce of the Lord. Saul</hi> thought he had done very well when he ſaved the ſheep and oxen for ſacrifice; But he was told, <hi>that to obey is better then ſacrifice, and to hearken then the fat of Rams.</hi> God had commanded burnt
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:153845:217"/> offerings, and ſacrifice, but he had no delight in them when his owne voyce was not obeyed, or when they were offered, eyther beſide or againſt his command. (<hi>Luk.</hi> 16.15.) <hi>That which is highly eſteemed among men, is an abomination to the Lord:</hi> His thoughts are not our thoughts, eyther in the doing of what is good, or in the pardoning of what is ſinfull. As man is apt to thinke, that God will not pardon what he hath done ſinfully, ſo that he will accept of what he thinkes he hath done holyly, though he hath no rule for the doing of it, but what himſelfe hath deviſed. We alwayes fayle in our meaſure, while we meaſure God by our ſelves. And it is as dangerous to take the rule of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from men, as not to take the rule of God. In this ſence we muſt call no man Maſter, nor may we be the ſervants of the wiſeſt men. And as we muſt not be <hi>the ſervants of men,</hi> becauſe (which is the Apoſtles reaſon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.23.) <hi>We are bought with a price;</hi> that is, dearely redeemed by Chriſt; ſo neyther may we be the <hi>ſervants of men,</hi> in following their dictates, becauſe we have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a word from God, whom alone we ought to follow, and none elſe, but in ſubordination to or complyance with his word and the commandement of his lips, or as it followes in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this verſe, <hi>the words of his mouth.</hi>

<pb n="407" facs="tcp:153845:217"/> in the former part it conſents with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Broughton; I have hid, or layd up the words of his mouth more then my daily bread.</hi> And as this tranſlation holds out a truth in it ſelfe, ſo the ſenſe meets with ours; for as the Originall word doth as properly ſignifie to hide, or lay up, as to eſteeme, ſo thoſe things are layd up or hidden by us, which are of moſt eſteeme. And this action of hiding or laying up the word, is often ſpoken of in Scripture, both as the practiſe, and as the duty of the Saints. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.11.) <hi>I have hid thy commandements in my heart.</hi> And the rule is given by wiſedome (<hi>Prov.</hi> 2.1.) <hi>My ſonne, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandements with thee.</hi> Wiſdome counſelleth us not onely to receive, but to hide the commandements. And (<hi>Pro.</hi> 4.20, 21.) Wiſdome goeth yet further; <hi>My ſonne, attend to my words, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline thine eare to my ſayings, let them not depart from thine eyes, keepe them in the midst of thy heart.</hi> The heart (as Naturaliſts ſay) is in the midſt or center of the body. Holy truths muſt be kept in the midſt of the heart, in the midſt of the middle, that is, in the ſafeſt place, in that moſt retyred chamber, the midſt of the heart. But why ſhould theſe words be hidden in the heart, which are and ought to be proclaimed in the eare and upon the houſe-top? I anſwer; wee hide things, firſt, that we may know where to have them; what is throwne at our heeles, wee know not where to have. Secondly, We hide things for ſafety, or from danger as well as to have them ready at hand for uſe. There are enemies who watch their opportunity to ſteale the word away from us, and therefore, it is our wiſdome as well as our duty to hide it or lay it up ſafe. So that in both notio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s we ought to hide the word of God; firſt, that wee may have it at hand for uſe: as it is ſayd of the Good houſe-holder in the Goſpel, that he layeth up, and hath in his treaſure, things both new and old. Secondly, that it may be kept out of the hand of the theife, who would rob us of that precious treaſure. Satan and the world, are <hi>Word-ſtealers,</hi> and they ſteale away the Word, not becauſe they deſire to make any uſe of it, but leſt we ſhould; therefore as <hi>Gideon</hi> (Judg. 6.11.) <hi>threſhed wheat by the wine-preſſe to hide it from the Midianites,</hi> ſo, ſeing there are myſticall <hi>Midianites,</hi> who dayly ſteale away the Word (that moſt neceſſary and precious wheat) from thouſands who have heard and received it, we ſhould (in a holy jelouſie and ſuſpition of them) hide it out of their reach. In converſion God
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:153845:218"/> puts the Law in our minde, and writes it in our heart; And through that grace received and dayly renewed, we alſo are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to lay it up there.<note place="margin">Pectus meum feci Bibliothe cam dei. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron: de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiano.</hi>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon election and deliberation, I eſteeme the word of his mouth;</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>I doe not eſteeme the word of God for nothing, or as not having conſidered it, and judged of the excellency of it, but upon long debate, conſultation, and tryall, I have pitcht my election upon it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, Some in theſe words conceave <hi>Job</hi> alluding to thoſe things which men doe out of long cuſtome, or according to their ancient courſe of life. As if he had ſayd; There is nothing more fixed and ſetled, eyther in my heart, or in my practiſe, then the Law of God; Obedience to it is now become to me as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature. I ſlight in compariſon of that, all humane Lawes and Conſtitutions; as alſo all my owne moſt practiſed formes and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes.</p>
                  <p>We render, <hi>I have eſteemed the words of his mouth more then my neceſſary food.</hi> The Original word ſignifies <hi>a ſtatute,</hi> or <hi>a law,</hi> and ſo any thing which is eſtabliſhed or appointed for our uſe, as a law, or ſtatute is. And becauſe our food, our neceſſary food, is that which is cut out or appoynted to us, eyther by God or man, therefore this word is applyed to ſignifie dayly bread, or neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry food. Banquets, and great feaſts, are without all meaſure, and bounds, they know no law, but are uſually full of exceſſe, both as to what is prepared, and to what is conſumed, 'tis ſeldome that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther providers or eaters keepe the rule in feaſting. But a due neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary food, which is for the maintaining of our lives, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of our ſtrength, to goe on in our callings, this food hath a bound, and we eate (as it were) by meaſure, or by ſtatute; therefore we tranſlate <hi>neceſſary food,</hi> others <hi>appoynted food, or a
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:153845:219"/> portion.</hi> So the word is uſed (<hi>Gen.</hi> 47.22.) <hi>Onely the Land of the Prieſts bought he not, for the Prieſts had a portion aſſigned them of Pharoah, and they eate the portion which he gave them;</hi> their aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned portion is expreſſed by this word; a portion it was to live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſuch as Schollers have in Colledges, and Almes-men in Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitalls by the Statute of their Founders. And in the booke of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> we have it twice uſed in ſuch a ſenſe (<hi>Pro.</hi> 30.8.) <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from me vanity, and lyes, give me neither poverty nor riches, feed me with food convenient for me,</hi> or <hi>with my ſtatute bread;</hi> that is, give me ſo much onely as the law of nature, or the law of my neceſſity and conveniency calls for, to fit me for duty; with this ſtatute bread let me be fed, let others have their full tables, this ſhall ſerve my turne. Againe (<hi>Pro.</hi> 31.15.) <hi>Shee ariſeth alſo while it is yet night</hi> (ſpeaking of the good houſe-wife) <hi>and ſhe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth meate to her houſe-hold, and a portion to her maidens;</hi> ſhe doth not throw the houſe out at windows, or make havock of all, as not caring which end went forward. And as ſhe is no prodigal waſter, ſo ſhe is neyther niggardly nor ſcraping, neither pineing nor pinching, but giveth a meete portion to her maidens. So here, <hi>I have eſteemed the word of thy mouth more then my neceſſary food.</hi> This ſmall proportion of food greatens the ſenſe of the Text, and heightens <hi>Jobs</hi> holineſſe and piety very much; for when we come to full tables, where there is exceſſe, our ſtomacks loath the meate, and the more meate there is, the leſſe ſome are able to eate, becauſe the ſtomacke is over-charged with the ſight of it. Appetie may be dull'd with abundance; but when we finde onely a convenient, neceſſary ſtatute portion, as it were, ſo much as is needfull to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie hunger, and give ſome moderate delight, this pleaſeth moſt, and is more eſteemed by temperate perſons then the greateſt feaſt in the world. A man doth not nautiate his neceſſary food, or loath what hunger craves; a cruſt of bread, and that which is courſe is pleaſant then; neceſſary food is the ſweeteſt food, and we are beſt ſatisfied with that which breeds no ſatiety. <hi>We live moſt comfortably with that food, without which we cannot live at all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably.</hi> So then, when <hi>Job</hi> ſaith here, <hi>I eſteemed the word of his mouth more then my neceſſary food,</hi> it is as if he had plainely ſayd, I tooke more care for, and had a higher eſteeme of the food of my ſoule, then for that food of my body, which neceſſity forceth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man to eſteeme.</p>
                  <pb n="411" facs="tcp:153845:219"/>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That, a godly man hath a high eſtimation of the word of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, He doth not onely eſteeme it, but he eſteems it as food.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He eſteemes it as neceſſary food.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He eſteemes it more then neceſſary food.</p>
                  <p>Here are three ſteps, by which his eſtimation of the word of God is to be taken. <hi>David</hi> ſaith of a godly man (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2.) <hi>His delight is in the law of the Lord.</hi> The word there uſed ſignifies both <hi>will, and delight.</hi> Some render it <hi>(voluntas) will,</hi> and others <hi>(voluptas) delight.</hi> We may take in both, his will, and his delight is in the law of the Lord, or he delightfully wills it. Would you know where the delight and joy of a Godly man is; it is in the law of the Lord, there 'tis fixed, and no where elſe comparatively, but in the Lord of the Law. Theſe two are inſeparable, he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in the Law hath firſt delighted in the Lord, and he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in the Lord, cannot but delight in the Law. There are two metaphors uſed in Scriptute, which ſhew the eſtimation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light which Saints have in the law of God, or in the word of his mouth.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As the word is compared <hi>to food;</hi> ſecondly, as the word is compared <hi>to treaſure:</hi> the word is often compared to food, and the moſt delicious food (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.103.) <hi>How ſweete are thy words unto my taſte, yea ſweeter then honey to my mouth.</hi> And (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.10.) <hi>They are ſweeter then the honey and the honey-combe:</hi> He doth not meane the honey-combe barely, as the veſſell wherein the honey is kept, but by the honey-combe he means the honey that flows or drops immediately and (as I may ſay) natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally without any art, or preſſing out of the combe, which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed the pureſt honey; ſuch is the law of God to the ſpirituall palate of a Godly man. That feaſt (<hi>Math.</hi> 22.2. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.16.) to which ſinners are invited, is onely the declaration of the word, and minde of God in the Goſpel. The word of Grace is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt feaſt which God makes his people. Againe, the word is as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten compared to treaſure: what the eſteeme, and deſire of man is to treaſure, I need not ſtay to tell you. <hi>The Judgements of God</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 19.10.) <hi>are more to be deſired then Gold, yea then much fine gold.</hi> And againe (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.72.127.) <hi>The law of thy mouth is better to me then thouſands of Gold and ſilver.</hi>
                     <pb n="412" facs="tcp:153845:220"/> And (<hi>ver.</hi> 127.) when he ſaw how ſome made voyd the Law of God, he ſayth, <hi>Therefore I love thy commandements above Gold, yea above fine Gold.</hi> As if he had ſayd, becauſe I ſee ſome men eſteeme and reckon thy law as if it were droſſe, and throw it up as voyd and antiquated, or taking the boldnes, as it were, to repeale and make it voyd, that they may ſet up their own luſts and vaine imaginations, becauſe I ſee both prophane and ſuperſtitious men, thus out of love with thy Law, therefore my love is more enflamed to it, <hi>I love it above gold,</hi> which leads the moſt of men away cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives in the love of it; and I eſteeme it more then that which is moſt eſteemed by men, and gaines men moſt eſteeme in this world, <hi>Fine Gold;</hi> yea as he ſayd (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.) <hi>more then much fine Gold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>A high and reverentiall eſteeme of the word of God, workes the heart and keepes it cloſe to the obedience of the word.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> having ſaid before, <hi>I have kept the commandements of his mouth, I have kept his wayes, and not declined, I have not gone back,</hi> now comes to the ſpring of all this conſtancy in obedience, <hi>I have eſteemed the words of his mouth,</hi> &amp;c. Love is the ſpring of action, and eſteeme is the top of love; we love nothing which we doe not eſteeme, and what we love much we thinke we can never eſteeme enough; And what we thus love and eſteeme, we ſtrive to keepe cloſe unto. They that receive the truth, and doe not receive the love of it, quickly turne from it to beleive a lye, yea God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſends them <hi>ſtrong deluſion to beleive a lye, becauſe they received not the love of the truth.</hi> As not to love, the truth is a ſin, ſo it is puniſhed with another ſin, the love of error. Though we have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken much truth into our underſtandings, yet unleſſe we take it into our affections alſo, we cannot hold it long. 'Tis love which holds the heart and the word together. No man willingly obeyes that Law which he doth not love. Before <hi>David</hi> could ſay, <hi>The Law is my meditation all the day,</hi> he ſayth, <hi>O how I love thy law</hi> (Pſ. 119.97.) The hypocrite, <hi>who hates inſtruction, and caſts the word of God behinde his backe;</hi> that is, ſlights and vilifies it to the utmoſt (for ſo much to caſt behinde the backe imports, the hypocrite, I ſay, who thus caſts the word of God behinde his backe) will be talking of the word, and have it much in his mouth, yea he will mouth it ſo, or be ſo talkative about it, that God reproves or
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:153845:220"/> checks him for it (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.16.) <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the wicked ſaith God, What haſt thou to doe to declare my ſtatutes, or that thou ſhouldeſt take my Covenant in thy mouth.</hi> So then, the hypocrite was very buſie with his tongue, and he could ſpeake much of that which he loved ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a whit. But was the hypocrite a man of his hands alſo? was he buſie in obeying the word which he had caſt behinde his back? The next words of the Pſalme (<hi>ver.</hi> 18, 19, 20, 21.) tell us what he was buſie about, even this, he was breaking the Law as faſt as he could; <hi>When thou ſaweſt a theife, then thou conſenteſt with him, and haſt been partaker with Adulterers,</hi> &amp;c. The inditement is large, and upon many heads, yet all true, and is therefore cloſed with, <hi>Theſe things haſt thou done</hi> (ver. 21.) I the Lord am wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and ſo is thy owne Conſcience. That Scripture is a cleare glaſſe, wherein we may ſee how all they will uſe the Law of God, who doe not highly eſteeme the words of his mouth. We may read <hi>Jobs</hi> text backward for their character; <hi>Their feete have not held his ſteps, his way have they not kept, but declined, they have gone back from the commandement of his lips.</hi> And why ſo? <hi>for they have eſteemed the words of his mouth no more then their un-neceſſary food, no more then the ſcraps that fall from their Table, no more then</hi> (as the Proverb ſaith) <hi>their old ſhoes. I have eſteemed the word of his mouth more then my neceſſary food.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have eſteemed the word of his mouth,</hi> &amp;c. It is, as if he had ſayd, this is enough for me that God hath ſayd it, to make me eſteeme it.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whatſoever God ſaith, is to be eſteemed for his owne ſake, or becauſe he hath ſayd it.</q>
                  <p>As God needs not borrow light from any what to ſpeake, ſo he needs not borrow teſtimony or Authority from any to ratifie what he hath ſpoken. <hi>He is to be beleeved for himſelfe.</hi> His words need no ſanction, but <hi>(ipſe dixit) I the Lord have ſayd it, or thus ſaith the Lord;</hi> that is enough to ſilence all queryes and diſputes both about the truth of what is delivered, and the neceſſity of our obedience to it. As the word of Gods mouth is to be obeyed, ſo it is therefore to be obeyed, becauſe it is the word of his mouth. That he hath ſayd it muſt command our faith; As he is the true God, ſo he is the God of truth. Every word of his mouth is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:153845:221"/> As what God hath ſpoken muſt be the rule of our faith, ſo that he hath ſpoken it muſt be the reaſon of our faith. <hi>I have eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the words of his mouth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, From both theſe verſes, we may take notice of the ſeverall ſteps, by which <hi>Jobs</hi> piety did ariſe to ſo eminent a hight.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He ſtrongly tooke hold of the ſteps of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He diligently kept his way.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He declined not, eyther to the right hand, or to the left.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, He went not backe from the Holy commandement, both which negatives may be reſolved into this affirmative, He walked very cloſely and exactly with God, in utmoſt perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, He tooke a delightfull care about all thoſe things, which the word of God called him unto, even beyond all the care which he tooke for thoſe things which are moſt conduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to and neceſſary for the comforts of his body or natural life.</p>

                     <p>But he is in one minde, and who can turne hinc? and what his ſoule deſireth, even that he doth.</p>
                  </q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>IN this verſe, <hi>Job</hi> is conceived by ſome, at once making diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his owne infirmitie, and of the ſoveraignty of God; But though all agree that they carry a full diſcovery of the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of God, yet many are ſo farre from judging them a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of <hi>Jobs</hi> infirmitie, that they rather diſcover the ſtrength and hight of his Grace and holines. To cleare the whole matter, we may take notice, That there are three apprehenſions about the ſcope and ſence of theſe words.</p>
               <p>Firſt, As if in them <hi>Job</hi> renderd a reaſon of what he ſpake in the verſe immediatly foregoing, here giving an account, why he had kept ſo cloſe to God, and to his wayes; <hi>My foot hath held his ſteps, his way have I kept, and not declined, neither have I gone backe from the commandements of his lips,</hi> &amp;c. And why all this? <hi>for he is of one minde.</hi> That is, God will have his way, there's no reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his commandements muſt be obſerved; that which he once made a law, and rule for me to walke by, continueth ſo ſtill: <hi>He is of one minde.</hi> Therefore I muſt keepe cloſe to his minde. It were a vaine thing, for me to turne any other way, when God holds the ſame way. It were folly for me to change my practice, when I finde no change at all in his precepts; they being ſtill one and the ſame in themſelves, and having the ſame obligation upon me.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Theſe words may give an account, or a reaſon of his afflictions; As if he had thus expreſſed himſelfe; <hi>Though my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience beareth me witneſſe, that I have not gone onne in any ſuch ſinfull way, as ye tax me with, nor defiled my ſelfe with ſuch groſſe iniquities, as uſually draw downe the viſible Judgements of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men; Yet I finde God going on ſtill to afflict me, he keeps his rod upon my backe, and his burden upon my ſhoulders, his terrors ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp about me, and his arrowes drinke up my ſpirit. Nor will he be moved by any entreaty of mine to withdraw his hand from me; What ever pleaſeth him, he will doe, how unpleaſant ſoever it is to me.</hi> And what's the reaſon of all this? <hi>He is in one minde:</hi> God is
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:153845:222"/> unalterable: therefore doe not thinke, that becauſe he continueth theſe afflictions and burdens upon mee, that therefore all muſt be reſolved into my ſinne. No, we may reſolve all this into the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie, and unchangeablenes of God, he is in one minde, and he will doe what his minde is, and none ſhall turne him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Egregie tuetur divinam provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiam nam cum amici illa tantum ratione pro divina pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntia pug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, quod ſcele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra puniat, at Job illam agno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcit cum aerum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas ille immit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit propter prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claros fines no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis occultos ſoli deo notos. <hi>Pined:</hi> Juri &amp; liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tati dei aſſignat afflictiones, quas amici pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catis. <hi>Coc:</hi>
                  </note>Thirdly, (which ſutes the former) That <hi>Job</hi> here ſhewes his friends, the true way of reconciling his owne innocency, with the ſharp afflictions and troubles which were upon him, <hi>Job</hi> felt and ſaw (and others eyther did or might) that he was ſorely afflicted, And <hi>Job</hi> knew (though others did not) that he was innocent, as to the charge brought againſt him. Then how ſhall he reconcile the juſtice of divine providence, with his owne innocence? His friends knew not how to reconcile, the innocency of an afflicted man, and the Juſtice of an afflicting God. This was a riddle which they could not unfold. And therefore when they ſaw God thus afflicting him, they concluded as ſtrongly as if they had ſeene it, that <hi>Job</hi> had greatly offended God. But <hi>Job</hi> knew how to unlocke this ſecret, and expound this riddle; Hee knew how to maintaine and aſſert his owne integritie while he ſuffered, and yet acquit the Juſtice of God in laying thoſe ſufferings upon him. He could ſay, <hi>God is ſupreame; He is in one minde;</hi> And what he doth, he may doe becauſe he hath a minde to doe it. He hath deep purpoſes and deſignes, which I am not able to reach or fathome: Therefore though I complaine, I doe not complaine as if God had done me wrong, but becauſe I ſmart, becauſe I feel ſuch paines, and ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie a preſſure upon me. I am far from ſaying that he hath injured me, though he hath thus afflicted me; nor can any thing which he hath done or ſhall further doe, be an injury to me, for I confeſſe that he hath a right to doe whatſoever he pleaſeth to doe. Thus we have an excellent defence made by <hi>Job</hi> in theſe words, to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Lords ſharp dealings with him from the leaſt ſuſpition of injuſtice, and to accord the aſſertion of his owne afflicted inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, with a beleeving reverence of the righteouſneſſe of God; and ſo theſe words of his are the breathings of a very gracious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: teaching us far better then his friends had done, how to anſwer for God in his ſaddeſt diſpenſations towards man. They knew no other way to doe it, but by rendering <hi>Job</hi> a notorious hypocrite, an haynous offender, and theſe his ſufferings to be the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his hypocriſie and offences. But <hi>Job</hi> reſolves all into the
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:153845:222"/> unchangeablenes of Gods will, and the ſoveraignty of his power. Thus much for the generall ſcope of theſe words.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others conceave there is a redundancy in the affix <hi>(beth,)</hi> in. And ſo in ſtead of <hi>He is in one,</hi> the words are thus gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>He is one;</hi> As if <hi>Jobs</hi> meaning were this, There is none <hi>One but He,</hi> or none <hi>One as He.</hi> As Chriſt ſaith, <hi>There is none good but God,</hi> or <hi>there is but one good,</hi> that is, <hi>abſolutely good;</hi> ſo there is none one but God, that is, <hi>abſolutely One,</hi> God is ſuherlatively one, <hi>the one-moſt-one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Thus; <hi>But if he act againſt one, who can turne him?</hi> And ſo M. <hi>Broughton; Yet when he is againſt me, who can ſtay him?</hi> This hath a cleare truth in it, and fully hits the ſcope of the place.</p>
                  <p>But I conceive a fourth reading, (which leads to ours) to be yet more cleare, and that is, <hi>He is in one, and who can turne him?</hi> In one; what one? we anſwer, <hi>in one minde;</hi> noting the ſtabilitie of the thoughts, and purpoſes of God, his minde is one, his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is one, his decree is one, he is alwayes like himſelfe in all theſe. He doth not change his minde, as man doth; He is conſtant and fixed to his owne purpoſes, to the dictates of his owne will and wiſdome; <hi>He is one</hi>
                     <q>And who can turne him?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or, <hi>Who can turne him away?</hi> Or, as another renders, <hi>Who can make him returne backwards?</hi> that is, who can make him goe back from what he hath determined and once reſolved upon. True re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance or converſion is the change of the minde in man. Every man that is converted from his ſinfull ſtate &amp; courſe by the power of God, becomes another man (as to his morals and ſpiritualls)
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:153845:223"/> then he was before, but man cannot turne God, and make him any other then he is. God can cauſe man to change his minde; but man cannot make God change his minde, nor turn him backward. The Prophet ſaith of God (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.25.) <hi>That he turneth wiſe men backward, and maketh their knowledge fooliſh.</hi> The turning of the wiſe backward, is the altering of their councells. When they will not alter them, God can. He ſaith, Their councells ſhall not ſtand, nor ſhall they reach the end to which they were appoynted. And it is ſo.<note place="margin">Sed quid ego? ſimilis cum ſit ſibi ſemper &amp; idem. Quis rationem ab eo facti di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctivè repoſcat.</note> But can the wiſeſt of men, or all wiſe men plotting and laying their heads together, turne the moſt wiſe God back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? They cannot. So that theſe words hold forth the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and ſtabilitie of the purpoſes, counſells, and decrees of God. <hi>Who can turne him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>And what his ſoule deſireth, even that he doth.</q>
                  <p>God is not like man, conſiſting of a ſoule and body; Man is the reſult of ſoule and body united together. A ſoule is not a man, nor is a body a man; man is a third thing riſing out of both; But <hi>God is a ſpirit.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Animam ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cujus ſumi pro eo cujus eſt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma res eſt nota, quare anima dei, deus eſt. <hi>Sanct:</hi>
                     </note> And when <hi>Job</hi> ſayth, <hi>What his ſoule deſireth;</hi> The meaning is, what himſelfe deſireth. The ſoule of a man, is indeed the man, becauſe the choyceſt part of man; though man hath another part, namely, a body, yet <hi>the ſoule is he.</hi> The ſoule of man, being his beſt part, is often put for the whole man. But the ſoule of God is not put here for God, becauſe it is the beſt part of Him; <hi>His ſoule is himſelfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, This phraſe or manner of ſpeaking, <hi>what his ſoule de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth,</hi> notes onely the intenſnes and ſtrength of his deſires, or what he deſiereth ſtrongly. The Lord ſometimes makes offers to doe that which is not in his heart or deſire to doe: But what ever his ſoule goes out upon indeed, or would have done, that ſhall be done. Thus the word is uſed frequently, to ſet forth the full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God to doe a thing (<hi>Levit.</hi> 26.30.) <hi>And I will deſtroy your high places, and cut downe your images, and caſt your carkaſes upon the carkaſes of your idols, and my ſoule ſhall abhorre you.</hi> That is, extreamly abhorre you, I will abhorre you with the utmoſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence. And againe (<hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.14.) <hi>Your new moones, and your appointed feaſts, my ſoule hateth.</hi> That is, I hate them with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect hatred, to ſhew how deepe his hatred was of thoſe things (as done by them) he ſaith, <hi>my ſoule hateth them;</hi> As if he had ſayd,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:153845:223"/> I hate your formality in my worſhip, from the bottome of my heart. We have the ſame ſence (<hi>Jer.</hi> 6.8.) <hi>Be thou inſtructed O Jeruſalem, leſt my ſoule depart from thee.</hi> That is, leſt I totally depart. I will depart not onely by withdrawing ſome of your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts, but even thoſe which are the more intimate and immediate diſcoveries of my love, <hi>my ſoule ſhall depart from thee,</hi> or, <hi>be looſed and diſ-joynted from thee</hi> (as we put in the Mergin) that is, I will be of no more uſe to thee, or a helpe to thee, then a member of the body is to the body, when it is diſlocated or remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from its proper joynt. Once more (<hi>Jer.</hi> 32.41.) <hi>I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce over them to doe them good, and will plant them in this land aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly, with my whole heart, and with my whole ſoule;</hi> That is, I will doe it for them entirely and affectionatly, or with entireſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                  <q>What his ſoule deſireth.</q>
                  <p>That is, <hi>What he deſireth,</hi> or whatſoever pleaſeth him;<note place="margin">Velle eſt hoc lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co aliquid pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarius expetere, concupiſcere, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let ad rem quam piam delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilem referri.</note> We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire onely thoſe things which are very pleaſing, And thoſe things which are moſt pleaſing to us, are, to us, very deſirable. <hi>The deſire of man is love in motion, as his joy is love at reſt.</hi> But in God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and joy are not diſtinguiſhable, in him there is no motion, all is reſt. <hi>What his ſoule deſireth,</hi>
                     <q>Even that he doth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Hebrew is very conciſe, <hi>His ſoule deſireth, and doth.</hi> That is, he no ſooner deſireth a thing, but he doth it,<note place="margin">Optat tantam &amp; protinus fectum eſt. <hi>Merc:</hi>
                     </note> or when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth, it is done. <hi>The will of God is execution;</hi> though he willeth many things, which (as to man) are not preſently, no nor till a long time after executed, yet as to himſelfe whatſoever God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth is executed, and whenſoever he pleaſeth, his will is actually executed among men. <hi>He deſireth, and it is done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the words thus opened, we may obſerve according to the firſt reading of the former part of the verſe. That
<q>God is one.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is one God, and but one. Thus the Lord ſpeaks of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by the Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.8.) <hi>Is there a God beſides me? Yea there is no God. I know not any.</hi> (Iſai. 45.5.) <hi>I am the Lord, and there is none elſe, there is no God beſides me.</hi> He is one himſelfe, and
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:153845:224"/> he hath not a ſecond. The Heathens having many gods, when they were oppreſſed by any one god,<note place="margin">Saepe premente deo dat deus alter opem.</note> they ſought reliefe from another. As Sorcerers and Witches goe to a ſtronger ſpirit, for help againſt what a weaker ſpirit hath done. Heathen gods were devill-gods, and they are many. The <hi>Jewes</hi> degenerating into Idolatry, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed their Gods according to the number of their Cities (<hi>Jer.</hi> 2.28.) But <hi>Jehovah, The living God, The Lord, is one God.</hi> We af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme from Scripture that there are three Hees or ſubſiſtences in the God-head (commonly called perſons) Father, Sonne, and Spirit; but theſe three are <hi>one,</hi> not onely by conſent, but by nature and eſſence. <hi>Heare O Iſrael</hi> (ſayd <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 6.4.) <hi>The Lord our God is one Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, From our reading; <hi>He is in one,</hi> or (as we ſupply) <hi>He is In one minde.</hi> Obſerve that great truth.</p>
                  <q>God is unchangable.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I the Lord change not</hi> (Mal. 3.6.) The unchangeablenes of God may be conſidered in divers things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In his eſſence or nature; God knoweth no decay. He is a ſpirit, an eternall ſpirit; He hath nothing mingled or mixed in him which ſhould worke or tend to alteration. God is ſimple, He is moſt ſimple, even ſimplicity it ſelfe. There is no compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in him, no diverſitie of qualities in him. Man changeth in his natural conſtitution, becauſe compounded and made up of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent elements, qualities, and humours, which contending and figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one with another, neceſſitate his change. Every day brings ſome, though inſenſible, changes upon us; And in a few yeares our changes are very viſible, and ſenſible. The Pſalmiſt ſpeaking of the heavens, which of all viſible creatures are in nature moſt unchangeable, yet calls them changeable in compariſon of God (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.26.) <hi>The heavens are the work of thy hands; They ſhall periſh, but thou ſhalt endure; yea all of them ſhall wax old like a garment; as a veſture ſhalt thou change them, and they ſhall be changed.</hi> The heavens are the pureſt part of the creation, and freeſt from elementary mixtures, yet they ſhall wax old, they ſhall be changed. In oppoſition to which the Pſalmiſt adds (<hi>ver.</hi> 27.) <hi>But thou art the ſame, and thy yeares ſhall have no end.</hi> Nor are the yeares of God onely without end, but himſelfe is without change. Indeed there is no change of time to God; paſt, preſent, and to
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:153845:224"/> come, are all the ſame to him, and he is the ſame in all; <hi>Thou art the ſame,</hi> or more emphatically according to the ſtrictnes of the Hebrew phraſe, <hi>Thou art thy ſelfe, alwayes thy ſelfe.</hi> As thou art thou waſt, and as thou art and waſt thou wilt be for ever. When <hi>Moſes</hi> deſiered to know the name of God, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 3.13.) wee finde it at the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe; and God ſaid unto <hi>Moſes, I am That I am; And he ſaid, thus ſhalt thou ſay to the children of Iſrael, I AM hath ſent me unto you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, As God is unchangeable in his eſſence, ſo in all his divine perfections and attributes; all which are eſſentiall unto him. God is as powerfull and ſtrong as ever he was (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.1. As high and ſoveraigne as ever he was, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.8. as wiſe and omniſcient as ever he was, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17.) As gracious and mercifull as ever he was, <hi>his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> (Pſal. 100.5.) As faithfull and true as ever he was (<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.3, 4.) And as juſt and righteous as ever he was, he doth and will reward every man according to his workes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God is unchangeable in his purpoſes, decrees, and counſells. The <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> boaſted of their decrees, that they alterd not (<hi>Dan.</hi> 6.18.) But the very unalterablenes of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Decrees is alteration it ſelfe compared with the unalterable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of divine decrees. We have the Lord thus ſpeaking in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet (<hi>Iſai.</hi> 46.16.) <hi>I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times, the things that are not yet done, ſaying my counſell ſhall ſtand, and I will doe all my pleaſure.</hi> And as the Lord eſtabliſheth his owne counſel, ſo he can unſetle the beſt layd counſels of the ſons of men (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.10, 11.) <hi>The Lord bringeth the counſel of the Heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect: The counſel of the Lord ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.</hi> And hence the Lord, by his Prophet, challengeth the deepeſt politicians, the Oracles for counſel, the <hi>Achitophels</hi> of this world <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſtraine their wits to the utmoſt, for ſecuring of their owne counſels from diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyntment (<hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.10.) <hi>Gird your ſelves, and ye ſhall be broken in pieces, take counſel together, and it ſhall come to nought; ſpeake the word, and it ſhall not ſtand; for God is with us;</hi> he is with us as to protect us againſt your open oppoſition, ſo to blaſt your moſt ſecret conſultations againſt us. And as the Lords counſels are immutable in themſelves, ſo he hath condeſcended to aſſure us of
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:153845:225"/> their immutabilitie (<hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18.) <hi>Wherein God willing more abundantly to ſhew unto the heirs of promiſe the immutability of his counſel, confirmed it by an oath, that by two immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to lie, we might have ſtrong conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> &amp;c. Oaths are ſacred and the ſtrongeſt confirmations between man and man, and therefore though the counſel of God be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable without an oath, yet that we might have the greateſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that it is ſo, God hath confirmed it by an oath. That ſo the heyres of ſalvation having two immutable things to reſt their ſoules and build their faith upon, might not onely have conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſtrong conſolation; ſuch conſolation as might maſter and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all the feare and unbeliefe of their owne hearts, and the gaineſayings of Satan.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, God is alſo unchangeable in his promiſes; what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he hath ſayd he will doe for his people, <hi>(He is in one minde)</hi> it ſhall be done. A promiſe from God is the beſt ſecuritie; halfe a promiſe, an <hi>it may be</hi> (as he ſpeakes to <hi>the meeke of the earth</hi> (Zeph. 2.3.) <hi>Seeke righteouſnes, ſeeke meeknes, it may be ye ſhall be hid in the day of the Lords anger;</hi> this halfe promiſe (I ſay) is better ſecurity then the hand or ſeal, yea then the oath of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt man on earth. (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20.) <hi>All the promiſes of God in him</hi> (that is, in Chriſt) <hi>are yea and in him amen;</hi> That is, they ſhall certainly be performed and accompliſhed. God doth not give promiſes (as many men doe) to rayſe and then diſappoynt and abuſe our Hopes; He doth not make promiſes rather for ſnares to catch others, then for bonds to tie himſelfe, as ſome men doe, (which is not only a great unworthines, and diſingenuitie in them, but a great iniquity and ſin) the Lords promiſes are our richeſt inheritances; and that not onely becauſe he hath promiſed greater and better things then are in the compaſſe of any mans power to make good, or in the compaſs of any mans underſtanding to make, but becauſe h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> will certainly be as good to us in performance as he hath been in promiſe. For <hi>He is in one minde</hi> concerning all that he hath promiſed. He will be mercifull as he hath promiſed, and pardon ſin as he hath promiſed, He will deliver us from trouble as he hath promiſed, and ſanctifie all our troubles to us, as he hath promiſed. He will give us his Spirit, as he hath promiſed, and ſave us eternally, as he hath promiſed.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, He is alſo in one minde, concerning his threatnings.
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:153845:225"/> He will be as good as his word in the evill which he hath ſpoken againſt ſinners, as well as in the good which he hath ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his ſervants (<hi>Zech.</hi> 1.5.) <hi>Your fathers where are they? and the Prophets doe they live for ever? But my words and my ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, which I commanded my ſervants the Prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? And they returned and ſayd, like as the Lord of hoaſts thought to doe unto us, according to our wayes, and according to our doings, ſo hath he dealt with us.</hi> That is, his threatnings have arreſted us as Sergeants doe a malefactor, or a debtor, and carryed us away their priſoners. As if the Lord had ſayd, <hi>Your fathers are dead, and my Prophets are dead alſo,</hi> but the words which my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſpake to your fathers concerning the ſword, famine, and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie which ſhould ſhortly come upon them, theſe dreadfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies dyed not, yea theſe are not yet dead but alive and in force againſt you. <hi>If we doe not take hold of the preceptive part of the Law by obedience, the poenal part of the Law will take hold of us for our diſobedience.</hi> Thus the Lord profeſſeth (<hi>Mal.</hi> 3.5.) <hi>And I will come neare to you to Judgement, and I will be a ſwift witnes againſt the ſorcerers, and againſt the adulterers, and againſt falſe ſwearers, and againſt thoſe that oppreſſe the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherleſſe, and that turne aſide the ſtranger from his right, and feare not me ſaith the Lord of hoſts, for I am the Lord, I change not.</hi> I will certainly be not onely a <hi>Judge</hi> but a <hi>witneſſe,</hi> and that a <hi>ſwift one,</hi> againſt ſuch wicked ones. There is no evading my Judgement, ſeing I am both witnes and Judge; as a witnes I know all that ye have done, and as a Judge I have power not onely to condemne you, but alſo to give you up into the hand of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner; for <hi>I am the Lord of hoſts;</hi> I have all the Armyes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth at my command and bidding. Thus I will doe, and be ye aſſured of it, that I will doe ſo; <hi>for I am the Lord, I change not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, God is unchangeable, or of one minde in his gifts. (<hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29.) <hi>The gifts, and calling of God are without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;</hi> That is, The gifts of his effectuall calling ſhall never be repented of; As they who receive them, will have no cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent (yea they will have cauſe to reioyce in them for ever) ſo God who gives them will not repent. <hi>He is in one minde,</hi> he will not alter his gifts. As <hi>Pilate</hi> when he was moved to alter his writing upon the Croſſe of Chriſt, anſwered, <hi>What I have written I have
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:153845:226"/> written;</hi> that is, what I have written ſhall ſtand; ſo what motion ſoever ſhould be made to God to recall the gifts of effectuall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, he would ſurely anſwer, <hi>What I have given I have given, my gift ſhall ſtand.</hi> There are gifts of a meere outward calling, which God takes away againe. His gifts doe not ſtand with ſuch, becauſe they ſtand ſtill with his gifts. That was the doome of the idle ſervant who had one talent given him; <hi>Take the talent from him, and give it to him that hath ten Talents</hi> (Math. 25.15.28.) But the gifts of effectuall calling ſhall not be taken away. (<hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17.) <hi>Every good gift, and every perfect gift</hi> (ſuch is the gift of effectuall calling) <hi>is from above, and cometh downe from the father of lights, with whom is no variablenes, nor ſhadow of turning.</hi> And as there is no variablenes in God, as to the matter or generall nature of the gifts which he beſtoweth (they are all good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect gifts in their kinde, though they are not all in the ſame degree of goodnes and perfection; God doth not give his people, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bread, and ſometime a ſtone, now an egge and anon a ſcorp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, now, I ſay, as there is no variablenes in God, as to the nature of the gifts which he beſtoweth) ſo there is no variablenes in him as to the act of giving or beſtowing. As the Lord <hi>giveth liberally, and upbraydeth not</hi> (Jam. 1.5.) ſo he giveth liberally and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth not. Thus we ſee he is not onely <hi>one, but in one minde;</hi> He is unchangeable; And that not onely in his eſſence and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attributes or perfections, but in his counſels, and decrees, in his promiſes, and threatnings, in his gifts and bounties to all his people; He giveth and repenteth not.</p>
                  <p>Before I paſſe from this poynt, it will be needfull to anſwer ſome Objections which are raiſed againſt it from thoſe Scriptures, which ſeeme to ſay, that <hi>God is not of one minde,</hi> or that his minde doth alter and change.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That report which <hi>Moſes</hi> makes of God, ſeemes to ſay ſo, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 6.6.) <hi>And it repented the Lord, that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart:</hi> What is repentance, but the change of the mind? therefore he that repents is not in one mind. Seing then God repents, how is he unchangeably in one minde? A like appearance of contradiction, we find (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.) not onely with this text in <hi>Job,</hi> but between the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe compared with the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the ſame Chapter. The 11<hi rend="sup">•h</hi> verſe ſpeakes thus; <hi>Then came the word of the Lord unto Samuel, ſaying, it repenteth me that
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:153845:226"/> I have ſet up Saul to be King</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>ver.</hi> 29.) <hi>And alſo the ſtrength of Iſrael will not lie, nor repent; for he is not a man that he ſhould repent.</hi> The ſtrength or victory of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is God, for it was by his ſtrength that <hi>Iſrael</hi> had all his victories; and of him <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaith, <hi>He will not repent,</hi> when as himſelfe had ſayd a little before, <hi>It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth me</hi> &amp;c. To theſe Scriptures we may adde 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, which in words holds out a great change in the minde of God concerning <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> if we compare the firſt and the fift verſes of that Chapter together (<hi>ver.</hi> 1.) <hi>In thoſe dayes Hezekiah was ſicke unto death, and the Prophet Iſaiah, the ſon of Amos, came to him and ſaid unto him, thus ſaith the Lord, ſet thine houſe in order, for thou ſhalt dye and not live.</hi> Here is a ſtrong affirmation that <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> ſhould dye; And to the affirmative the negative is alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; <hi>Thou ſhalt dye, and not live.</hi> 'Tis the ſtrongeſt manner of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting any thing, when the contrary is denyed. As it is ſayd of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt (<hi>John</hi> 1.20.) <hi>And he confeſſed, and denied not; but confeſſed, I am not the Chriſt</hi> &amp;c. So here, <hi>Thou ſhalt die, and not live.</hi> Yet we read (<hi>verſ.</hi> 5.) <hi>And it came to paſſe before Iſaiah was gone out of the middle Court, that the word of the Lord came to him, ſaying, Turne againe, and tell Hezekiah the Captain of my people, thus ſaith the Lord, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayers, I have ſeene thy teares: behold I will heale thee; on the third day thou ſhalt goe up unto the houſe of the Lord, and I will adde unto thy dayes fifeene yeares.</hi> Doth not this import an evident change in the minde of God? Having diſpatcht the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to tell <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that he ſhall die, and not live, He preſently after, even before he was got out of the Court, ſends the ſame Prophet backe to tell him that he ſhall live and not die. We have the ſame difficulty in that knowne place in the Propheſie of <hi>Jonah (Chap.</hi> 3.4.) <hi>Jonah</hi> is ſent to <hi>Nineveh</hi> with a direct meſſage; <hi>Yet fourtie dayes and Nineveh ſhall be overthrowne.</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as ſoone as the faſt was proclaimed and kept, and the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevites</hi> had repented and turned from their evil wayes, <hi>The Lord alſo repented of the evil denounced againſt them;</hi> (ver. 10.) <hi>And God ſaw their workes, that they turned from their evil way, and God repented of the evil that he had ſaid, that he would doe unto them, and he did it not.</hi> Here God repented of his threatning. He had ſaid <hi>Nineveh</hi> ſhould be over-throwne, yet when they turned from what they had done, God turned from what he ſayd he would
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:153845:227"/> doe. And did he not change his mind, in reference to his promiſe to <hi>Zion,</hi> as there in reference to his threatning againſt <hi>Nineveh?</hi> The promiſe to <hi>Zion</hi> runs in this tenour; <hi>This is my reſt for ever; here will I dwell, for I have deſired it</hi> (Pſal. 132 14.) Yet the Lord remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of <hi>Zion,</hi> he departed from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and gave it into the enemies hands. How many miſeries, and captivities did that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple undergoe, long agoe? and how are they ſcattered from <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> into all Lands unto this very day? How then ſhall we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the Text, and poynt in hand, with theſe quoted Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and many others of a like interpretation?</p>
                  <p>How is God unchangable, or, <hi>in one minde,</hi> when we read of his repenting what he had done, of his ſaying what he would doe, and yet not doing what he had ſaid, both in his promiſes &amp; in his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings? How can theſe changes and the Lords unchangeablenes ſtand together? or how is he but <hi>in one minde,</hi> the tenour of whoſe doings doth ſo often vary, both from what he hath formerly done, and from what he hath profeſſed he would doe. In a word, How is the Lord conſtant to what he ſayth he will doe, when eyther he doth it not, or doth the quite contrary to it? He that repenteth is not in one minde, ſeing repentance is a change of the minde.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I anſwer; Repentance properly taken notes a change of the minde; But in an improper or alluſive ſence, there may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance without any the leaſt change of the minde. When God is ſayd to repent (as in thoſe texts alledged) we are to underſtand it improperly, or onely in alluſion unto man. The Scripture in many other things ſpeakes of God, eyther as condeſcending to mans underſtanding, or as alluding to the common actions of man. God doth not act as man doth, yet by ſuch expreſſions as hold out, what and how man acts, we may come the more eaſily to underſtand what God doth. As in the preſent inſtance, when man repents, he doth theſe two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He ceaſeth to doe, what he began to doe, he breakes the thread of his former motions.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When man repents that he hath done, or made ſuch a thing, he is ready to deface and deſtroy that which he hath made or done: When man repents that he hath ſet up ſuch or ſuch a thing, he removes and takes it downe. Thus God is ſayd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, not becauſe his minde is changed, but becauſe (as a man that repenteth) he ceaſeth to doe what he did, or he deſtroyeth that
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:153845:227"/> which he had made. Thus the Lord is ſaid to repent his making of <hi>Saul</hi> king, becauſe he meant to remove him from being king; And to repent that he had made the world, becauſe his purpoſe was, for the ſin of man to deface and deſtroy the preſent beautie and excellency of the world which he had made. God often puts forth the effects of repentance toward man, but the repentance of a man never put forth any effect upon God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may anſwer thus; <hi>God often minds a change:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aliud eſt muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re voluntatem, aliud velle mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationem. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin: par: 1. q. 19. art. 7.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>But he never changes his minde.</hi> And ſo all thoſe Scriptures before mentioned, note onely that God did minde a change, or make a change: But not that he did change his minde. There is a vaſt difference between theſe two, to minde or determine a change, and to change the minde or determination. As for inſtance, a man that is reſolved to weare garments ſutable to the ſeaſon of the yeare, and temperature of the weather; in the heate of ſummer it is his minde to weare light and thinne garments that he may be coole, and in the cold of winter, his minde is to weare heavier and thicker garments that he may be warme. Now if this man when winter comes leaves off his light thinne garments, &amp; puts on thoſe that are heavier and thicker, he cannot be ſayd to change his mind, for his minde was alwayes to weare change of garments accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſeaſon of the yeare, and temper of the weather. And thus the Lord according to the changes which he finds among men for the better or for the worſe, doth both minde and make eminent changes among them, as to his providentiall adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whether in wayes of Judgement or of mercy, but in theſe he never changes his own minde, foraſmuch as his mind was everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly fixed, in caſe of ſuch emergencies, to make thoſe changes in his adminiſtrations and dealings with the ſons of men.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, For further anſwer, We are to diſtinguiſh between the outward ſentence, and declaration of God, and his ſecret pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or decree. God doth often change his ſentence, or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration: But he never changeth his purpoſe, decree, or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quaeſt:</hi> But is not that externall declaration, the minde of God alſo?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw:</hi> I anſwer; Theſe denounced ſentences or declarations are the minde of God, yet they are not the ſame with the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and purpoſes of God, but ſerve for the fullfilling and bringing
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:153845:228"/> of them about; for by the change which the ſentence revealed worketh in man, the counſel of God not revealed is effected. The fruſtrating of the one, fulfills the other; And the Lords deſigne in ſuch declarations of his minde, is to bring about or accompliſh his purpoſes and counſells. God did purpoſely declare or pronounce a ſentence of death againſt <hi>Hezekiah</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> to the intent that his counſell concerning the continuance of <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> life might be fulfilled. And he ſent the Prophet <hi>Jonah</hi> to publiſh a ſentence of utter deſtruction againſt <hi>Nineveh,</hi> purpoſely that his counſel concerning the preſervation of <hi>Nineveh</hi> might be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. The Lords counſel and purpoſe was that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſhould live, and recover out of that diſeaſe. But how did he fulfill this? even by ſending him a meſſage of death, which cauſed him to weepe ſore, and pray and cry earneſtly to the Lord for life. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, ſet thine houſe in order, for thou ſhalt die and not live. Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the Lord, ſaying,</hi> &amp;c. But then it may be queſtioned, was that word of the Lord true which he ſent to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> by the Prophet, ſaying, <hi>thou ſhalt dye.</hi> The ſentence publiſhed was true, and would certainly have come to paſſe according to the order and working of ſecond cauſes, for looking to them, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> muſt die, his ſicknes was unto death; <hi>In thoſe dayes was Hezekiah ſicke unto death.</hi> Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe his Phyſitians and all that were about him gave him over for a dead man. Onely God could reſtore him, and the way wherein he would reſtore him was by prayer. So for <hi>Nineveh,</hi> if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the deſert of their ſin, the ſentence was true, <hi>Nineveh</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed. But the Lord ſent his Prophet to tell them of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching deſtruction, that they might faſt and turne from their evill wayes, and ſo his purpoſe for their preſervation might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. Thus the outward ſentence is changed, but the minde of God is not changed. And theſe changeable ſentences were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by God, to bring about his unchangeable decree.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I anſwer; When God is ſaid to repent, the change is not in God, but in us, God is alwayes the ſame, but wee are not. God is ſo much the ſame, that he never alters, and man is ſo little the ſame, that he is alwayes altering; and, when he hath done evill, it is good for him that he is ſo. God did not change, but <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neveh</hi> changed by turning from ſin, and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> changed by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving more in prayer, and therefore he dyed not at that time,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:153845:228"/> nor were they then deſtroyed. The change is in the creature, not in God, when that is changed which God ſpeakes concerning the creature. He is ſtill unmoveable in the ſame minde; all the motion is in the minde of man. It is in this caſe as with a ſhip putting out to Sea. When a ſhip ſets out from the harbour, and ſayles by the ſhoare, the unexperienced paſſenger thinkes the ſhore moves from the ſhip, whereas indeed the ſhip onely moves from or by the ſhore. So when we thinke God changeth, or is moved, the change or motion is onely in our ſelves In one diſpenſation we take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the love of God, and in another of his wrath, in a third of his juſtice, and in a fourth of his mercy. Theſe are changes upon us, but not in God. And theſe ſhew that God changeth his courſe towards us, but they are no proofes of a change in God. For the love of God, and the wrath of God, the juſtice of God, and the mercy of God are ſtill the ſame, but we changing are caſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time under the effects of his love, and ſometimes of his wrath, we are ſometimes under the ſaddeſt droppings of his juſtice, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times under the ſweeteſt influences of his mercy. As when a man changeth his aſpect, and turnes about his body to another poynt, That part of the heaven which was before at his right hand, is now at his left; yet the heavens are as they were, they doe not change eyther their poſition, or their motion, but the man hath changed his. Thus the wrath, and love, the Juſtice, and the mercy of God ſtand alwayes at the ſame poynt; but man turneth ſometimes <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice-ward,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>mercy-ward;</hi> now he faces the wrath, and anon the love of God. And doing ſo, he meetes with many changes in the diſpenſations of God toward him, but there is no change in the minde of God toward him.</p>
                  <p>And ſeing God is unchangeable, or, <hi>in one minde,</hi> take this by way of deduction from it.</p>
                  <q>'Tis the duty of man to ſubmit himſelfe unto and acquieſce in the minde of God.</q>
                  <p>Seing the mind of God reſts, we ought to reſt in the mind of God; that is, we ought to reſigne up our ſelves, and to reſolve our minds into the mind, and our wills into the will of God. What ever plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God, ſhould pleaſe us. He is in one minde, and that one minde of his hath nothing in it but juſtice, and righteouſnes toward all, nothing but goodnes, and mercy, nothing but loving kindneſſe,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:153845:229"/> and faithfullneſſe toward his peculiar people. As the minde of God revealed in his word, ſhould be the <hi>rule of our actions,</hi> ſo the minde of God revealed by his workes, ſhould be the reſt or <hi>eaſe of all our paſſions.</hi> The minde of God is that by which we are to guide our ſelves in all we doe, and to that we muſt yeeld in all we ſuffer. While we ſee ſome ſorely diſcompoſed in their ſpirits, yea vext be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all reaſon at the diſpenſations of God, have we not reaſon to beleive, that they have never heard, or at leaſt not well learnt and digeſted this great truth, <hi>That God is in one minde.</hi> When the minde of God is done, himſelfe is pleaſed, and ſhould not what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever pleaſeth God, pleaſe us alſo, yea though it be in it ſelfe, bitter and unpleaſant to us? A gratious heart taſts ſweetneſſe in Gall and Wormewood, conſidered under this notion, as it is the will and minde of God he ſhould drinke it, or feed upon it. It was a ſtrange power that <hi>David</hi> had over the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or it ſhewes that they had a very ſtrong opinion of his juſtice and integrity, when it is ſayd (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.36.) <hi>Whatſoever the King did, pleaſed all the people.</hi> What was ſayd of him, we ſhould ſay in the higheſt ſence of God, whatſoever he doth ſhould be pleaſing to all his people. It was once the ſaying of a Court-flatterer; <hi>That which pleaſeth the King,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Placet mihi quod regi pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet; dixit <hi>Harpalus, Apud Herod: lib. 1.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>pleaſeth mee.</hi> We cannot flatter God in ſaying ſo. It is but our duty to ſay ſo; we ſin if we ſay not, and ſay not with our hearts, <hi>Whatſoever pleaſeth God, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us.</hi> He acts below both the duty and priviledge of a man, who reſolves himſelfe into the will of any man, how high ſoever, or though he be <hi>King-High,</hi> and he acts above both the ſtate and proportion of a man (though much below the duty of a Chriſtian) who doth not reſolve himſelfe into the will of the moſt high God, who is higher then the higheſt of the Kings of the earth. <hi>He vainely ſuppoſeth himſelfe God-High, who ſubmits not to the will of the moſt High God.</hi> Whatſoever God doth or will have done, man ſhould ſay, <hi>Even ſo be it, as God will have it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſome may ſay, if it be ſo, then it ſeemes we may not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to extricate our ſelves from, or to get a removall of any of thoſe evills, troubles, or afflictions, which at any time preſſe and greive us.</p>
                  <p>For anſwer to this ſcruple, I ſay.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is our duty in every trouble that God layeth upon us, to ſeeke unto God, and to uſe all good meanes for the taking of it off from us. But</p>
                  <pb n="431" facs="tcp:153845:229"/>
                  <p>Secondly, We muſt not ſeeke unto God for the removing of any evill from us, as being diſpleaſed with his laying it upon us: we muſt be quiet under our troubles, and yet we may both deſire and endeavour to be quit of them. Though God be <hi>in one minde,</hi> yet that doth not neceſſitate man to one condition, nor hinder him from ſeeking a better then that wherein he is.</p>
                  <p>I have inſiſted the longer upon this poynt, becauſe <hi>Job</hi> gives it as a general anſwer to all his friends queryes about him, and as the beſt expedient for reconciling the difference between them and him. <hi>He is in one minde,</hi>
                     <q>And who can turne him?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence learne.</p>
                  <q>That as God is unchangeable in himſelfe, ſo none can alter or change him.</q>
                  <p>Some men are of a very ſteady ſpirit, they are not in and out, as we ſay, forward and backward: let them alone, and they are true to their own principles, and they will be true to others ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their promiſes. Yet, poſſibly, theſe men may be turned aſide, and led out of the way, by the perſwaſion of others. A ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle head and a ſmooth oyly tongue, may worke them off from their owne reſolutions. It hath been a queſtion diſputed among moral Philoſophers, <hi>Whether a wiſe man may be an uncertaine or a various man;</hi> And they reſolve it Negatively; Wiſdome is as balaſt, which keeps the minde from floating. And it hath been ſayd of a wiſe man among the Heathen, that the Sun might as ſoone be thruſt out of his line, as he from the line of Juſtice; yet let no man glory in man, no not in wiſe men. The wiſeſt, and moſt conſtant among men may doe unwiſely and prove unconſtant. The moſt reſolved among the children of men, may be wrought upon, and brought over to what they purpoſed not. But this is the glory of God, that as he is in one minde, ſo none <hi>can turn him,</hi> or make him in two. None can turne him out of the way, eyther of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Judgements, or promiſed mercies; what he hath a minde to doe, he will not be put by the doing it.</p>
                  <p>We may affirme three things concerning the workes of God, or concerning God in his workings.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The workes of God are ſo full of myſtery, that none can
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:153845:230"/> fully comprehend them; there is much in his ordinary workes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond man, and his extraordinary workes are all beyond man. We (by reaſon of our indiligence) ſee but little of any of his workes, and ſome of his workes are ſuch, as we can ſee but a little way into them with all our diligence.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The workes of God are ſo full of righteouſneſſe, that no man can juſtly reprove, or finde fault with them. They who come with the moſt curious &amp; critical eyes to examine the workes of God, ſhall not finde any flaw or defect in them. There have been many, who (through their preſumptuous folly) have found fault with the workes of God, but there was never any (who with his moſt refined wit) could finde a fault in them. The <hi>Jewes</hi> of old complained of, and quarrel'd at the wayes of God as unequall (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.25.) but when it came to tryall, they could prove nothing but the inequality of their owne.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The workes of God are ſo full of power, that <hi>none can put a ſtop to,</hi> or hinder the accompliſhment of them. Theſe are three excellent perfections of the workes of God; And the laſt is that which is here under hand. <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> though a great King, was not able to bring a worke about which he had a minde to, The reſcue of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> out of the hand of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and therefore he ſends this pitifull cry to the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (2 King. 19.3.) <hi>The children are come to the birth</hi> (that is, the buſines is ripe for execution) <hi>and there is no ſtrength to bring forth.</hi> The workes of the ſtrongeſt men may ſticke in the birth for want of ſtrength to bring them forth. But the workes of God never ſticke in the birth upon that or any other account. <hi>He is in one minde, and who can turne him?</hi> There are foure wayes by which men are uſually turned off from or ſtopped in their workes, but by none of them will God be turned, when he hath a minde to worke.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Men are often ſtopt by outward power; they doe not eyther that good or that evill which they would, becauſe they cannot, and their <hi>cannot,</hi> poſſibly, doth not lie in this, that they have not a power in themſelves proportionable to the worke, or becauſe they have medled with a matter too great for them, and for which they are no match; but they therefore onely <hi>cannot</hi> doe what they would, becauſe they are hindered from doing it. A man may have ability to maſter the worke he is about to doe, yet not
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:153845:230"/> to maſter the impediments that ſtand in the way of it. But all the power of the creature cannot hinder God; <hi>If he will worke, none can let him</hi> (Iſa. 43.13.) <hi>The power of men is weakneſſe unto God.</hi> And that which lookes like weakneſſe in God, is ſtronger then the united ſtrength of all men (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.25.) <hi>The fooliſhnes of God, is wiſer then men; and the weakneſſe of God is ſtronger then men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Men are, or may be turned by counſel or advice: and ſome who could not be ſtopt by power, have yet been ſtopt by perſwaſion. An eloquent tongue hath prevailed, where a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hand could not. We read how <hi>Abigail</hi> prevailed upon <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> a mightie warrier, and mightily reſolved to deſtroy <hi>Nabal,</hi> and all his houſe (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.22.) <hi>So and more alſo doe God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light, any that piſſeth againſt the wall. David</hi> ſpake not onely peremptorily, but with a kinde of adjuration; And he was upon his march with foure hundred armed men at his heeles to put his purpoſe into Execution: Yet a diſcreet woman goes out to meet and turne him from his courſe, and turne him ſhe did; ſhe did it effectually. But what could <hi>Abigail</hi> a woman doe, to prevaile with <hi>David</hi> and his Souldiers? What ſhe did, ſhe did by perſwaſion, ſhe layed arguments before him, and managed them with ſo much pathetical rhetoricke, and clearnes, that he could not withſtand her (<hi>ver.</hi> 32.33.) <hi>And David ſaid unto Abigail, Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, which ſent thee this day to meete me; and bleſſed be thy advice, and bleſſed be thou which haſt kept me this day from coming to ſhed bloud, and to avenge my ſelfe with mine owne hand.</hi> Thus men may be turned from what they have reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, eſpecially when they doe not well deliberate before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve. But God cannot be turned by any counſel or advice, ſeing whatſoever he purpoſeth to doe, he doth it upon the unerring ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and counſel of his owne will. Thoſe paſſions of anger and jealouſie, in which (as he is ſet forth to us in Scripture) God is ſayd to act, are yet the iſſues of infinite deliberation. <hi>He that doth all things by the beſt counſel, can never be turned by any.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Men are often turned by petition, when they will not by argument, and you may entreate them to deſiſt from what they were about to doe, though you cannot adviſe them out of it. And we know that of all things prayer is the moſt prevailing with God. Nothing hath ever turned God ſo much as prayer
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:153845:231"/> hath; and yet prayer it ſelfe (in the ſence here intended) cannot turne God. We muſt not thinke that we change God by our prayers, though when we pray, God often makes a gratious change for us. Whatſoever his minde is to doe, he doth it, yea though prayer ſtand in his way. Wee may ſay that the greateſt providentiall changes that were ever made in the world, God hath made them upon the prayers of his people; yet he never changed his owne minde in the leaſt at the prayer of his people. The Lord calls his people earneſtly to call upon him ſo, and meeting him by prayer to ſtop him when he is preparing to doe ſome great thing againſt them, or to bring ſome great evill upon them. (<hi>Amos</hi> 4.12.) <hi>Therefore thus will I doe unto thee O Iſrael, and becauſe I will doe this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God O Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> Wee may take thoſe words <hi>prepare to meete thy God O Iſrael,</hi> not ſo much for a challenge as for a direction. But how ſhall <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael prepare to meete God?</hi> Not with weapons of warre, not with ſword, and ſpeare, theſe will make no defence againſt God. No: but with teares and prayers, theſe are the armes and amunition of a Saint, there's no contending with God, but onely by humbling our ſelves before him.</p>
                  <p>But you ſay, prayer cannot turne God.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer; prayer hath cauſed and may cauſe God to turne from his outward actings and diſpenſations, onely, it cannot turne God from any of his counſels or reſolutions. And becauſe prayer hath ſo great a power upon God, to turne him from his outward diſpenſations, therefore he ſometimes hath forbidden prayer, when he was reſolved not to turne from ſuch threatned diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (<hi>Jer.</hi> 14.11.) <hi>Then ſayd the Lord unto me, pray not for this people for their good.</hi> As if the Lord had ſayd; if any thing could prevaile with me, thy prayer would; But becauſe I am fully purpoſed to viſit their iniquities, therefore I will not have thy prayers run waſte. As for them let them pray as long as they will, as their prayers come, onely from their neceſſities, not from their hearts, ſo they ſhall not come neere mine; nor doe I care how long their prayers (which are but pudle water) run waſte; let them pray and ſpare not; but let them be ſure of this, that though they pray I will not ſpare; ſo it follows (<hi>ver.</hi> 12.) <hi>When they faſt I will not heare their cry, and when they offer burnt offering, and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will conſume them, by the
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:153845:231"/> ſword, and by the famine, and by the peſtilence.</hi> Their owne prayers had no power in them to turne God; and he who had a power to ſtop God by prayer, is himſelfe ſtopt from prayer, as in the place laſt quoted, ſo once before (<hi>Jer.</hi> 7.16) <hi>Therefore pray not for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make interceſſion to me, for I will not heare thee.</hi> And as the Lord ſtopt <hi>Jeremie</hi> from prayer for them, ſo he profeſſeth that if they who in former ages had been moſt prevailing with him, ſhould now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine mannage their ſuite before him, yet he would not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by it. (<hi>Jer.</hi> 15.1.) <hi>Then ſaid the Lord unto me, though Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Samuel ſtood before me, yet my minde could not be toward this people.</hi> As if the Lord had ſayd; Though they ſhould get my chiefe favorites, to ſollicit their cauſe, and plead on their behalfe, yet they ſhould finde me <hi>in one minde, and that even they could not turne me.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt never ſolicited any cauſe but he ſped in it, but the beſt of men may be earneſt ſoliciters and not ſpeed. For though good men will not ſolicit a bad cauſe before God, or pray againſt his revealed will, yet they doe not alwayes hit his ſecret will. And God who ſayth to his people generally (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 50.15.) <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee:</hi> yet in ſome particular caſes he will not deliver them, though they call upon him. Prayer is not onely an allowed, but a commanded meanes, and ſo the moſt probable meanes to obtaine deliverance, yet that cannot alwayes obtaine or fetch it. Yea God who often brings his people into trouble, on purpoſe to provoke them to ſeeke his helpe, yet, ſometimes, will not helpe them though they ſeeke him. And the reaſon is, becauſe <hi>he is in one minde, and will not be turned from his purpoſes, no not by prayer.</hi> If once the Lord be reſolved to deſtroy, prayer cannot ſave; Though <hi>Moſes and Samuel ſtood before me, yet</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>my minde could not be toward this people, caſt them out of my ſight, and let them goe forth, ſuch as are for the ſword to the ſword,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But if prayer cannot turne God, then you lay a temptation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us to turne away from prayer.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer; firſt, as was ſhewed before; prayer may turne God in reference to his outward diſpenſations, though it cannot turne him from any of his counſels and reſolutions.</p>
                  <p>But then it may be enquired; how ſhall I doe to direct my prayer? For I know not what the purpoſe or reſolution of God
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:153845:232"/> is, I onely ſee what his diſpenſations are. And if ſo, I may pray againſt the minde or purpoſe of God; I may aske for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or taking away of that, which he is purpoſed ſhall continue; and I may aske the gift of that, which he is reſolved not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer; Firſt, That though the minde of God to give us ſuch a mercy, or to withdraw ſuch an affliction, be a ſecret to us; yet this is revealed, that it is our dutie to pray about theſe things. What God will give or doe for us when we pray is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret; but this is revealed, that <hi>in all things</hi> we ought to pray. That's the Apoſtles rule (<hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6.) <hi>Be carefull in nothing, but in every thing by prayer and ſupplication with thanksgiving make your requeſts knowne unto God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Suppoſe the things we pray about, whether for the having, or removing of them, be ſuch as it is not the minde of God either to give or to remove. Yet we may pleaſe God, in praying for the attainement of thoſe things, which it is not his pleaſure to give, and in praying for the taking away o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> thoſe things, which it is not his pleaſure to remove. We doe not offend God, by asking that which he will not give, if the thing be ſuch, as is in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall nature of it according to his will. The Lord takes it well at our hands that we pray, and is well pleaſed to heare us pray, when he is not pleaſed to heare, (that is, to grant) our prayers.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Be not turned from prayer, becauſe prayer cannot turne God, for it is a great argument that the minde or purpoſe of God and his decree is to give ſuch a mercy, or to remove ſuch an evill, if we have an heart to pray much for or about it. For God who hath ſayd, <hi>I will be ſought unto, that I may doe it for them</hi> (Ezek. 36.) <hi>hath not ſayd unto the ſeed of Jacob, ſeeke ye me in vaine</hi> (Iſa. 45.19.) And when God ſtirres up his people to pray, it is an argument he is ready to heare. <hi>Thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cauſe thine eare to heare. (Pſal.</hi> 10.17.) So that as God takes it well at our hands that we pray for many things which he hath no purpoſe to give us; ſo it is a good ground of faith that he hath a purpoſe to doe ſuch or ſuch things for us, when he puts it into our hearts to pray for them.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Let not any ſtumble at the dutie of prayer, becauſe of Gods unchangeablenes; for wee pray, not to change the minde of God, but to fullfill it; wee pray for the fullfilling of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:153845:232"/> not for the altering of them, for the fullfilling of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, not the voyding of them. And becauſe God <hi>is in one minde, and none can turne him,</hi> we have the more incouragement to pray. For all the good things that are in the minde, counſel, and purpoſe of God to doe for us, and beſtow upon us, are borne, and brought into the world uſually by the hand of prayer: Prayer is (as it were) the midwife, to bring our bleſſings to the birth. Therefore though prayer cannot turne God, yet we have no reaſon to turne from prayer.</p>
                  <p>There is yet a fourth thing which may ſtop men, but cannot ſtop God; And that is nearnes of relation. Men are often turned out of the way when a neare relation ſtands in their way. They purpoſed to doe this or that, but that ſuch a friend, or ſuch a kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath turned them from their purpoſe. 'Tis rare to finde ſuch a ſpirit as the Lord by <hi>Moſes</hi> obſerved and highly commended in the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> (Deut. 33.9.) <hi>Who ſaid unto his father, and to his mother, I have not ſeene him, neyther did he acknowledge his Brethren, nor knew his owne children.</hi> That is, hee was not turned by the neareſt relations from executing that terrible ſentence of the Lord upon the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> his Brethren after they had made the Golden Calfe, of which you may read at large (<hi>Exod.</hi> 32.26, 27, 28, 29.) It is truely ſayd, That <hi>relations have little entity in them, but they have the greateſt efficacy in them:</hi> And their effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy hath never appeared more in any thing then in this, The turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of man from his purpoſe or his duty. But relations have no efficacy in them to ſtop or turne the Lord from his purpoſes. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.11.) <hi>It is a people that have no underſtanding, therefore he that made them, will not have mercy on them, &amp; he that formed them will ſhew them no favour.</hi> As if the Prophet had ſayd; When the Lord threatens to bring evill upon you, poſſibly ye will ſay, we are the worke of thy hands, he hath made us, ſurely then he will not deſtroy us. We finde that argument pleaded (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.8.) <hi>But now O Lord, thou art our father, we are the clay, and thou our pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and we all are the worke of thy hand: Be not wroth very ſore O Lord,</hi> &amp;c. To plead our relation to God by Chriſt is the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt plea in prayer, and to plead any relation to God, hath a great ſtrength in it. Yet while ſome urge theſe, they ſignifie nothing, and have no force at all. They who are like that people in the Prophet, <hi>a people of no underſtanding,</hi> ſpirituall idiots, ſuch as have
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:153845:233"/> no knowledge to doe good, or no practicall underſtanding in the things of God; ſuch, I ſay, may urge their relation, and get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by it; <hi>He that made them, will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them, will ſhew them no favour.</hi> The Lord profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſtrongly againſt any power which a relation ſhall have upon him to turne him, or take off the proceſſe of his Judgement under high provocations from the higheſt of men. (<hi>Jer.</hi> 22.24.) <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, though Coniah the ſon of Jehoiakim King of Judah were the ſignet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence, and give thee into the hand of them that ſeeke thy life,</hi> &amp;c. To be as the ſignet upon the right hand, notes the moſt intimate neerenes of relation, yet the Lord breakes thorough this, and will not be turned away by it, from the ſevereſt actings of his owne purpoſes. Thus it hath appeared that as the Lord is unchangeable in himſelfe, ſo nothing can change him. <hi>He is in one minde, who can turne him?</hi>

                  <q>That God doth whatſoever he will, or whatſoever he deſires to doe.</q>
                  <p>There is no bound to the power of God, but his owne will. When the Heathen asked in ſcorne, <hi>Where is your God?</hi> The Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt tells them plainely both where he was, and what he had been doing, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.3.) <hi>But our God is in the heavens, he hath done whatſoever he pleaſed.</hi> The doings of God know no bounds, but his owne pleaſure; <hi>He hath done whatſoever he pleaſed.</hi> He will not indure to have any articles put upon him, nor any circles or limit-lines drawne about him. The power of God is regulated and determined by nothing but his will. A great Prince once ſayd, <hi>That he had indeed a circle about his head</hi> (meaning his Crowne) <hi>but he would not beare it to have a circle about his feete; he muſt goe which way himſelfe pleaſed, and doe whatſoever his ſoule deſired.</hi> Yet there are circles drawne <hi>about all the powers of the world, only God hath none.</hi> His government is purely arbitrary. Nor is it fit that the government of any but his ſhould be ſo; <hi>'Tis neither fit nor ſafe that any ſhould governe arbitrarily or purely at will, but he whoſe will is altogether pure, but he whoſe will is ſo farre from need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a rule, that it is one, yea the onely unerring One.</hi> (Ezek. 24.14.)
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:153845:233"/> 
                     <hi>I the Lord have ſpoken it, it ſhall come to paſſe, and I will doe it, I will not goe backe, neither will I ſpare, neither will I repent; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thy wayes, and according to thy doings, ſhall they judge thee, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid, It is my will to have it thus, and therefore it ſhall be thus. That which is moſt ſinfull in man, is moſt holy in God, to act according to his owne will. Mans will is to crooked a rule, for others to guide their actions by, or for himſelfe to guide his actions by. He that ſaith, I will doe this or that, becauſe I will, doth nothing as he ought. There ſhould be much willingnes, but none of our owne will in what we doe. But as Gods will ſhould be both the rule and reaſon of our act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſo it alwayes is of his owne. There is (as I may ſay) an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wilfulnes in God, <hi>He will have what he will, and he will doe what he will.</hi> God will not doe many things which he can, but he can doe whatſoever he will, and whatſoever he will doe, he is juſt and righteous in doing it. And this is the glory of God, to have ſuch a power, and ſuch a will. And there being ſuch a power in God, with ſuch a will, we need not feare his power. We leave men to their will as little as we can, whom we truſt with much power. When men in power, have nothing but their will to guide them, wee preſently feare oppreſſion and tyranny, and that we ſhall be farre from leading peaceable and quiet lives under them in all godlines and honeſty, which is the moſt deſireable and bleſſed fruit of Magiſtracy. Nor is this a pannicke or groundleſſe feare, ſeing the will of man is corrupt and ſinfull, ſelfeiſh and revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. And who can but feare to be under that power which hath no limits but a corrupt will? But who would feare to be under the power of God, acted by his will, ſeing he willeth nothing but what is righteous, juſt, and good. What can we expect but right from him, who is righteouſneſſe? what but good from him (in a good cauſe) who is goodnes it ſelfe, how great or how unlimited ſoever his power is? If ſome men might doe what they would, what evill would they not doe? There's nothing ſtands between ſome men, and the wronging of all men they have to doe with, but the want eyther of power or of opportunity to doe it. The Lord can doe what he will, but he will doe nothing but what is good. He is able to ruine all men, but he will wrong no man, no not the worſt of men. <hi>What his ſoule deſireth, even that he doth;</hi> but it is impoſſible his ſoule ſhould deſire to any thing but what is right.</p>
                  <pb n="440" facs="tcp:153845:234"/>
                  <p>Laſtly, When it is ſayd, <hi>Whatſoever his ſoule deſireth, even that he doth,</hi> or more cloſe to the Originall, <hi>He deſireth, He doth.</hi> We learne, That,
<q>It is as eaſie with God to doe a thing, as to deſire to have it done.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>All men would doe what their ſoules deſire, but moſt men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that which they cannot doe; yea though men have a deſire to doe a thing, and a power to doe it alſo, yet it is not ſo ſoone done as deſired; there muſt be a preparation and the uſe of meanes before man can doe what he hath a power to doe; ſo that though a man hath power proportionable to his deſire, yet he is not preſently a partaker of his deſire. But God can make his power as ſpeedy as his deſire. He can make the declaration of his will, and the execution of it contiguous. For though many things lie long in the will of God before they are done, and what he willed from eternity is don in time, and the time of doing it be yet a great way off, yet he can doe any thing as ſoone as will it, and whatſoever he willeth or deſireth, is, to him, as done already. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.30.) <hi>Thou ſendeſt forth thy Spirit, they are created.</hi> The creation there ſpoken of is providence, for that is a continued creation. The firſt creation was the production of all things out of nothing to that being which they had, but there is another work of creation which is the continuing or renewing of things in their being, and of this he ſayth; <hi>Thou ſendeſt forth thy Spirit,</hi> that is, thy power, <hi>they are created, And thou reneweſt the face of the earth.</hi> Thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt a new world; And thus God makes a new world every yeare, ſending forth his Spirit, or quickning power in the raine, and Sun to renew the face of the earth. And as the Lord ſends forth his power in providenciall mercies, ſo in providenciall Judgements. <hi>He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; He toucheth the hils, and they ſmoake</hi> (ver. 32.) A man can ſoone give a caſt with his eye, ſo ſoone can God ſhake the earth, that is, eyther the whole maſſe of the earth, or the inferior ſort of men on the earth. When he <hi>looketh,</hi> or caſts an angry eye upon <hi>the earth it trembleth. He tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the hils</hi> (that is, the powers and principalities of the world) <hi>and they ſmoake;</hi> If he doe but <hi>touch them they ſmoake,</hi> that is, the dreadfull effects of the power and Jugement of God are viſible upon them. As ſoone as the Lord calls, all creatures readily ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their ſervice. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.31. <hi>&amp;</hi> 34.) <hi>He ſpake, and there
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:153845:234"/> came divers ſorts of flies, and lice in all their coaſts.</hi> (ver. 34.) <hi>He ſpake, and the Locuſts came; and caterpillers, and that without number.</hi> If the Lord ſpeake the word, it is done. God ſpake the world into this beautie, he did but ſay, <hi>Let there be light, and there was light.</hi> And he can ſpeake the world into trouble and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; He doth but ſay, <hi>Let there be darknes, and there is darknes.</hi> It was an high ſpeech of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who meeting with ſome oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from that yong noble Roman <hi>Metellus,</hi> ſayd, <hi>Let me alone, leſt I deſtroy thee.</hi> And preſently added; <hi>It is eaſier for me to doe this, then to ſpeake it.</hi> Such was his power, that he could eaſier take away a mans life, then give ſentence of death againſt him. This is moſt true concerning the great God of heaven and earth, there is no more difficultie in his doing of a thing, then in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring and willing it to be done.</p>
                  <p>The generall truth of this verſe carryeth in it a twofold infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Of terrour to the wicked, <hi>God is in one minde,</hi> the ſame opinion which he had of their wayes, and perſons heretofore, the ſame he hath ſtill. The ſame curſes and Judgements which he hath denounced againſt them formerly, are in force ſtill. Is it not a terrible thing to incorrigible wicked men, to remember that what the ſoule of God deſireth, he doth, when his ſoule deſireth nothing but vengeance and wrath for them. <hi>Therefore tremble before the Lord ye wicked, and be ye ſore affraid at the remembrance of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeablenes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Of abundant comfort to the faithfull and righteous. The mind of God is mercy to them, and he is in this one minde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, none can turne him. His ſoule deſireth to doe them good; <hi>And whatſoever his ſoule deſireth that he doth.</hi> What can Saints deſire more, then that God ſhould doe all that for them which he deſireth? and all that he will aſſuredly doe. <hi>Therefore rejoyce in the Lord ye righteous, and give thankes at the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his unchangeablenes.</hi>

                  <p>This poynt was largely inſiſted upon from thoſe words of the former verſe; <hi>He is in minde, who can turne him?</hi> God doth what he hath a minde to doe, therefore I ſhall not here ſtay to ſhew the certainty of Gods performing what he hath appoynted, but to ſhew the appoyntment of all things which he performeth.

                  <q>Whatſoever God performeth, or doth to any man, was before ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted, or decreed for, or concerning him.</q>
                  <p>All the workes of God in time, were his decrees before time, hee performeth the thing that is appoynted, and appoynted by himſelfe, and his appoyntments are as himſelfe is from everlaſting. Whatſoever God doth, we finde it under an appoyntment.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, and eſpecially, as to (the buiſines in hand) the afflictions and ſuffering of his ſervants; All their ſufferings are under an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyntment. (<hi>Micah</hi> 6.9) <hi>The Lords voyce cryeth unto the City, and the man of wiſdome ſhall ſee thy name, heare ye the rod, and who hath appoynted it.</hi> As if he had ſaid; your ſelves by your ſins are the procurers of it; we the Prophets are onely the reporters and publiſhers of it; But God himſelfe is the appoynter of it. As pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique and national rods, ſo private or perſonall rods are appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; And as often as we feele their ſmart, we ſhould conſider their appoyntment. The Apoſtle (1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.3.) moves the Saints to a ſteadines of ſpirit under affliction upon this ground, <hi>that no man ſhould be moved by theſe afflictions</hi> (he doth not mean that wee ſhould be without ſenſe of our afflictions, ſtroakes, and ſufferings, but his meaning is, that we ſhould neither be moved by impatience under them, to murmure at them, nor be moved by undue feares to faint in them, why?) <hi>for your ſelves know that wee are appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereunto.</hi> The afflictions are appoynted to us, and wee are appoynted to them, and <hi>your ſelves know it.</hi> This doctrine hath been publiſhed to you, that afflictions are under a divine appoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that there is a decree of God about them. And that, Firſt, as to the matter, of what ſort the affliction ſhall be; ſecondly, as
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:153845:236"/> to the meaſure or degree; how great the affliction ſhall be. Thirdly, the appoyntment reaches the ſeaſon, and that twofold.

(<hi>Jer.</hi> 15.3.) <hi>I will appoynt over them foure kindes, ſaith the Lord, the ſword to ſlay, and the doggs to teare, and the fowles of heaven, and the Beaſts of the Earth to devoure and deſtroy.</hi> And as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying ſword, ſo the place whether the ſword ſhall goe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy is under an appoyntment. When the queſtion is put (<hi>Jer.</hi> 47.6.) <hi>O thou ſword of the Lord, how long will it be ere thou be quiet? put up thy ſelfe into thy ſcabbard, reſt and be ſtill;</hi> The anſwer is made (<hi>ver.</hi> 7.) <hi>How can it be quiet, ſeing the Lord hath given it a Charge againſt Askelon, and againſt the Sea-ſhore, there hee hath appoynted it.</hi> He hath appoynted this place, this ground, this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, this Citie, this ſhoare for the ſword; and the ſword being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an appoyntment, muſt doe as it is appoynted. If wee look all the Scripture over, wee ſhall finde all things under an appoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; As firſt our children are appoynted; when <hi>Adam</hi> had another Son, his wife <hi>Eve</hi> ſayd (<hi>Gen.</hi> 4.25.) <hi>God hath appoynted mee another ſeed in ſtead of Abel, whom Cain ſlew.</hi> Secondly, our wives are appoynted. When <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant was ſent by him
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:153845:237"/> to <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> for a wife for <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>If the woman come whom thou haſt appoynted to be wife to my Maſter Son,</hi> &amp;c. That this woman rather then any other ſhould be his Maſters ſons wife, was (he knew) by the appoyntment of God (<hi>Gen.</hi> 24.14.44.) Thirdly, All our Times are appoynted by God. (<hi>Exod.</hi> 9.5.) <hi>My times are in thy hand</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 31.15.) Fourthly, not onely things that are or exiſt, but things that as yet are not, come under an appoyntment. What ſhall be is as certaine to God, as what already is. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.7.) <hi>And who as I, ſhall call, and ſhall declare it, and ſet it in order for me, ſince I appoynted the antient peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? And the things that are coming, and ſhall come?</hi> The antient who have been long and ſtill are, were appoynted by me, and the things which are not but ſhall be in a continued ſucceſſion, like Linkes of a Chaine holding one in another, are appoynted by me. The things that <hi>are coming</hi> (or that are neere the birth) and <hi>ſhall come</hi> (things afarre off) all that is to be done, as well as all that hath been done, is under an appoyntment. Fifthly, as all the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of our lives, ſo death it ſelfe is under an appoyntment (<hi>Heb.</hi> 13.27.) <hi>It is appoynted for all men once to dye.</hi> And as death is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted, ſo the ſeaſon or the when of it is appoynted. (<hi>Job</hi> 7.1.) <hi>Is there not an appoynted time to man?</hi> Againe (<hi>Job</hi> 14.5.) <hi>Thou haſt appoynted his bounds that he cannot paſs.</hi> Sixthly, as the dayes of man, ſo <hi>The day of the Lord,</hi> the day of Judgement, is under an appoyntment. (<hi>Act.</hi> 17.31.). <hi>Becauſe he hath appoynted a day wherein he will Judge the world in righteouſneſſe by that man whom he hath ordained;</hi> the time is fixt, he hath appoynted a day, a day of Judgement. When the appoynted day ſhall be is a ſecret, but, that he hath appoynted a day is revealed, and that he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted all the motions and changes that are coming upon the world, till that day come. So then</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Wee are not governed by blinde fortune.</hi> Nor</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>By a Stoicall Fate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>But by a divine appoyntment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, The appoyntment of God determineth, firſt, the end; ſecondly, the meanes leading to and promoting the attainement of the end. Laſtly, as God appoynteth Great things, ſo the leaſt, <hi>A ſparrow falls not to the ground without him,</hi> that is, without his appoyntment, or without an order from heaven, yea <hi>the haires of our head are all numbred</hi> (Math. 10.29, 30.)</p>
                  <pb n="447" facs="tcp:153845:237"/>
                  <p>This truth well digeſted is enough not onely to ſupercede and ſtop all the undue feares, but to eſtabliſh the comforts of all the people of God. What can be better for us, then that all things are in ſo good a hand, that they are appoynted and meaſured out by God, that he cuts out our condition for us, that he formes and frames our ſtate for us. It hath been ſaid, <hi>Every man is the faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his owne Condition,</hi> there is ſome truth in that, mens condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are much according to their actings; but God is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame faſhioner and orderer of every mans ſtate and portion. The portion of the wicked is ſet out by God (<hi>Job</hi> 20.29.) <hi>This is the heritage of the wicked, and the portion appoynted to him of God.</hi> Theirs is indeed a ſad portion, but it is a juſt and a deſerved one. He alſo faſhions and cuts out a portion for his owne people; And though theirs is often for the preſent a bitter one, and ſo deſerved by them, yet he alwayes makes it a good one to them, and hath prepared a better for them, which they have not at all deſerved. <hi>Hee performeth the thing that is appoynted for me:</hi>
                     <q>And many ſuch things are with him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some expound this of the paralel dealings of God with other perſons; <hi>Hee performeth the thing that is appoynted for mee,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But, ſecondly, I conceive that wee may rather expound theſe words <hi>(many ſuch things)</hi> of ſuch things as <hi>Job</hi> had already ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; As if he had ſayd, The Lord bath <hi>performed the thing that hee hath appoynted for mee;</hi> hetherto (I have had my portion of trouble and ſorrow unto this day) and <hi>I am like to have more;</hi>

                     <hi>many ſuch things are with him,</hi> that is, hee hath bread enough for us for to morrow, and for next day, for this yeare and for the next, for all the dayes and yeares of our lives, <hi>many ſuch things are with him;</hi> So, when we have ſuffered and been troubled this day, we may ſay, hee hath other ſufferings and troubles for us againſt next day, when theſe are gone and blowne over; this I ſuppoſe is the thing that <hi>Job</hi> aymes at; ſo that he ſeemes to prepare himſelfe for new rods, and to ſay, in the ſweeteſt and humbleſt compoſure of a meek and quiet ſpirit, <hi>It is the Lord, let him doe with me, what ſeemeth good in his owne eyes. All that God hath performed to me-wards hee hath appoynted for mee, yet I am not of opinion that God hath ſpent all his appoyntments upon mee; ſurely hee hath not drawne his quiver dry, hee hath yet more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes to ſhoot at my poore already wounded and bleeding breaſt. My heart miſgives or rather gives me, that he hath not yet ſhewed me all the troubles which he hath appoynted for the tryall of my graces, for the exerciſe of my patience, and for the purging out of my corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For many ſuch things are with him.</hi> And this wee may take two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In reference to the power of God; hee can doe many ſuch things as theſe, he can doe what he hath done, his arme is not ſhortned.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In reference to his owne deſervings; many ſins are with me; and therefore I have reaſon enough to ſuſpect, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more ſorrowes are appoynted for mee. I may need more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and refining, and therefore it is like I ſhall have it, and that another furnace is heating for me. In how holy a frame was the ſpirit of this good man! He juſtifieth God in all that he had done, and he was ready to ſubmit (though it made his fleſh feare and tremble at the thought of it, as he confeſſeth it did in the next verſe; yet I ſay, he was ready to ſubmit) to whatſoever God would yet doe, knowing that he could, and being much perſwaded that he would doe much and many things more then he had done yet. For (ſaith he) <hi>Many ſuch things are with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>God hath variety of wayes to exerciſe and chaſten his in.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As hee hath more then one Bleſſing, ſo he hath more then one
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:153845:238"/> Chaſtening; as he hath many Comforts, ſo he hath many ſorrowes ready at his hand; as hee is <hi>the God of all Conſolation,</hi> ſo hee is the God alſo of all tribulation; and as hee can make all Conſolation to abound, ſo hee can make all tribulation to abound; <hi>many ſuch things are with him.</hi> When you have ſuffered one affliction, doe not thinke that you have ſuffered all, there may be a ſecond at hand. They are uſually <hi>twin-borne,</hi> and ſometimes we may ſay (as <hi>Leah</hi> in another caſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.11.) <hi>A troupe cometh.</hi> Troubles come by Troupes. We read the Lord threatning his antient peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the <hi>Jewes</hi> after great ſufferings, and Judgements had been upon them, with a ſucceſſion of new Judgements. The whole twenty eight Chapter of <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> is but a continued deſcription of that variety both of bleſſings and curſes which God hath at hand ſtored up in his Treaſures. Read how various his Judgements are (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.37. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.28.) <hi>I will puniſh you yet ſeaven times more for your ſins</hi> (Lev: 26.18.24.) And that <hi>ſeaven times more</hi> may be underſtood; Firſt, in reference to the variety of their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, you ſhall have ſeaven kindes of puniſhments more then you had; ſecondly, in reference to the degrees of their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I will make them ſeaven times greater then they were. As <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> commanded the fiery furnace to be heated ſeaven times hotter; ſo the Lord can command the furnace to be heated ſeaven times hotter: And as the Lord can chaſten and afflict his people ſeaven times more both in kinde and degree, ſo they may need ſeaven ſorts of afflictions more, and a furnace heated ſeaven times more then formerly, eyther for the purging out of their ſins, or for the exerciſe and proofe of their Graces. For though the Lord hath a great variety of afflictions at his command, yet he never layeth any one of them upon us, but when there is need. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> gives us aſſurance of this from God (1 <hi>Ep:</hi> 1.6.) For having ſaid, that Saints are <hi>kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation, wherein they greatly rejoyce,</hi> he preſently adds, <hi>though now for a ſeaſon (if need be) ye are in heavineſſe through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold temptations.</hi> Wee ſee the temptations wherewith the Lord exerciſeth the heires of heaven here on earth, are many, yet they never feele theſe but when <hi>need is;</hi> And many have as much need of the rod for their ſpirituall eſtate, as they have of bread for their naturall. <hi>Many ſuch things are with him.</hi>

                  <p>The word ſignifies both <hi>to make haſte,</hi> and <hi>to trouble,</hi> the reaſon is, becauſe, as ſome ſay, trouble makes haſt, <hi>ill newes comes apace;</hi> or, ſecondly, becauſe wee are very haſty to get out of trouble; and uſually over-haſty; he that is in trouble would faine be out of it; no man loves to ſticke in ſuch a condition: therefore the ſame word in the Hebrew elegantly ſignifies both to make haſt, and to trouble.

                  <q>God can eaſily vary the appearances of himſelfe to us.</q>
                  <p>He can diſcover himſelfe ſo to us, as that his preſence ſhall be better to us then life, better to us then ten thouſand of theſe lower worlds, or as the heaven of this lower world, yea as the onely fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of that heaven which is above. What is heaven, but this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God. <hi>Thou wilt ſhew me the path of life; In thy preſence is fullnes of Joy</hi> (Pſal. 16.11.) Thus God can make himſelfe knowne with a delightfull preſence, yet he can make himſelfe knowne, and often doth, even to his owne, with a dreadfull and an amazing preſence. God in whom there is no variablenes, nor ſhadow of turning, can vary the demonſtrations of himſelfe to us, as much as light varieth from darkneſſe, or life from the ſhadow of death. God hath a light ſide, and a darke ſide as to manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though in himſelfe he is light, and in him there is no darknes at all. Sometimes his preſence is ſweetnes and joy, even joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable and glorious; at other times, his preſence is bitternes and ſorrow, even ſorrow unſpeakeably grievous. There is nothing
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:153845:240"/> ſo dreadfull to wicked men at any time as the preſence of God. As it hath been their wretched care to hide their ſins from God as much as they could, ſo they would count it their happines to have their perſons hid for ever from the preſence of God. That which is both the ſin and trouble of the wicked at all times, is the trouble, if not the ſin of ſome godly men at ſometimes, namely, the preſence of God, not in it ſelfe, but with reſpect to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his manifeſting himſelfe to them, and dealing with them. As will appeare further in the next clauſe of this verſe. <hi>I am trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at his preſence,</hi>
                     <q>When I conſider I am afraid.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As if he had ſayd,<note place="margin">Cum diligentius conſidero ejus tantam potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, cujus nunc in me ſpecimen vides, noe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum quin expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcam, non quid in me, ſit iniquitas, ſed ne deinceps pergat ſua potentia me affligere. <hi>Merc:</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>When I ſeriouſly weigh and have deep thoughts in my minde, when I ſet my underſtanding throughly on work to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſeverity of Gods proceedings with me, and when I remember the wormewood and the gall, thoſe bitter taſts and ſad experiences which I have had already of his dreadfull power, then I am afraid.</hi> And this feare ariſeth not from the guilt or accuſations of my own conſcience, but leſt the Lord ſhould againe act and put forth that his terrible power upon me.</p>
                  <p>But what feare is here meant? or how was <hi>Job</hi> afraid upon the taking up of this conſideration? I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>There is firſt, a pure filial or ſon-like feare, when wee are afraid to ſin againſt and diſpleaſe our father. This feare is a ſpeciall grace promiſed in the new Covenant, and the beginning of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a pure ſlaviſh feare, when wee dread God as a Judge, and revenger. This feare is the iſſue of the Covenant of workes, and the beginning of ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is a mixt feare, not a pure filial, nor a pure ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh feare, but with a mixture or ingrediency of both. Such I conceive the feare of <hi>Job</hi> was; his was a mixt feare; it had ſome tang of ſlavery in it, and it had ſome touch of Son-ſhip in it; there was much of the ſpirit of Bondage in it; and ſomething of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Adoption in it. With the former feare many good men have been much exerciſed in all ages, eſpecially before Chriſt came in the fleſh, and the clearer breaking and beaming out of Goſpel light, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15.) <hi>Yee have not received the ſpirit of bondage to feare againe.</hi> And (<hi>Job.</hi> 14.27.) <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:153845:241"/> nor be yee afraid;</hi> that is, be not burdened and oppreſt with that ſervile and ſlaviſh feare which you are ſubject to Chriſt ſpake it to his owne Diſciples, for even at that time deep impreſſions of that feare were upon them, doubting much what would become of them, when he ſhould (of which he had told them) leave the world, and be gone from them. And beſides that ſpeciall reaſon which the Diſciples then had to feare at that time. This feare uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ariſeth from two reaſons, in others, at all times.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, From the Conſideration of their owne weakneſſe and faylings.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From the Conſideration of the Majeſty and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God; when they Conſider theſe things they are afraid. And though Beleevers are freed from the praedominancy of ſlaviſh feare, and are endued with infuſions of true filial feare, yet they are often taken with this mixt feare, as in reference to their owne weaknes, ſo reſpecting the Majeſty of God, with whom they have to doe. <hi>When I Conſider I am afraid of him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>That the Majeſty and power of God duely Conſidered, are terrible even to his owne people.</q>
                  <p>Many men have ſlight thoughts of the great God, they trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble not, they feare not; what's the reaſon? they Conſider not; <hi>they are careles, and therefore they are feareleſſe, they are ignorant, and therefore they are confident.</hi> There are none ſo bold as they who are thus blind. <hi>Who is the Lord</hi> (ſayd Hard-hearted <hi>Pharaoh) that I ſhould obey his voyce, to let Iſrael goe? I know not the Lord, neyther will I let Iſrael goe.</hi> That's a ſad Confidence that proceeds from ignorance, and a ſad feareleſnes that hath no ground but careleſneſſe. I remember what the anſwer was of a very Godly man upon his death-bed; who having much trembling upon his ſpirit at the apprehenſion of the greatnes, Majeſty, and glory of God, it was ſaid to him by a Godly friend that came to viſit him; <hi>Sir, you have knowne God, and been long acquainted with him, why are you thus full of feare and trembling?</hi> O, ſaith he, <hi>if I knew God more, I ſhould tremble more.</hi> If we were but more acquainted with, and did more Conſider of the Infinite greatnes of God, and of our owne diſtance from him as creatures, much more as ſinners, how ſhould we be ſwallowed up with divine amazements; ſo that we
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:153845:241"/> muſt charge it upon the want of Conſideration, that ſo many have ſuch undue and unbecoming thoughts of God, as alſo that their thoughts fall ſo much below both their duty, and their ſins: if wee did but Conſider how ſinfull we are, and how holy God is, we ſhould alwayes ſerve him with feare, and rejoyce with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling; <hi>When I conſider I am afraid of him. Job</hi> was afraid of him when he conſidered him; and ſo was <hi>Aſaph</hi> (Pſal. 77.3.) <hi>In the day of my trouble I ſought the Lord, my ſore ran in the night and ceaſed not, my ſoule refuſed to be comforted. I remembred God and was troubled, I complained and my ſpirit was overwhelmed.</hi> Such a remembering of God is not a bare act of the minde, in oppoſition to forgetfulnes, as if <hi>Aſaph</hi> had ſayd, <hi>I remembered God,</hi> that is, <hi>I did not forget him,</hi> but I <hi>remembered God,</hi> that is, I fixed my heart upon him, I minded him fully, or ſet him fully before my minde: though the rememberance of God is the ſpring of Comfort to us, and that many wayes, yet an <hi>Aſaph,</hi> a holy man, The holyeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many men, may be troubled when he remembers God, when he Conſiders his glory, greatnes, power, and Majeſty, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a poore worme. When the holy Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaw the Lord (in viſion) ſitting upon a throne high and lifted up, and ſaw the Seraphims covering their faces and their feete, and heard them crying one unto another, and ſaying, <hi>Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hoſts, the whole earth is full of his glory.</hi> Then he ſayd; <hi>Woe is mee for I am undone, becauſe I am a man of uncleane lips,</hi> &amp;c. What a concuſſion was there upon his ſpirit upon the meeting of theſe two viſions; firſt, that of the holines of God; ſecondly, that of his own uncleanenes, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.) <hi>Moſes</hi> who had ſuch intimacy with and acceſſe unto God, is yet deſcribed trembling at his giving the Law (<hi>Heb.</hi> 12.21.) <hi>And ſo terrible was the ſight, that Moſes ſaid, I am exceedingly afraid and tremble: Moſes</hi> knew that God was his friend, a God in Covenant with him, yet <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, <hi>I exceedingly feare and quake;</hi> the ſight and voyce o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> God is our Bleſſednes, yet there may be a troubleſome and a terrible both ſight and voyce of God, even <hi>Moſes</hi> was afraid: and ſo was <hi>Habakkuk</hi> (Chap. 3.16.) <hi>When I heard</hi> (that is, thy ſpeech, <hi>v.</hi> 2.) <hi>my belly trembled, my lips quivered at the voyce, rottennes entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my bones, and I trembled in my ſelfe,</hi> &amp;c. And at laſt wicked men (though now ſo unconſidering who God is) ſhall have ſuch Conſiderations of him as ſhall for ever drowne and ſwallow them
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:153845:242"/> up in a deluge of feare: the thoughts of the preſence of God will be Eternall terror to them, who now are unmoved with the thoughts of his preſence, or who have not God in all their thoughts. There is a preſence of God which ſhall be death to them, who have not lived in a due and awfull conſideration of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Thus the Apoſtle deſcribes the puniſhment of wicked men (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.9.) <hi>They ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord.</hi> Wee may underſtand it two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They ſhall be puniſhed by being put from the preſence of the Lord; That's the puniſhment of loſſe, they ſhall be for ever excluded and baniſhed from his preſence. That which was their deſire here, ſhall be their miſery hereafter. They who care not for the preſence of God in this world, ſhall be everlaſtingly curſed with the want of it, in the world which is to come.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I rather conceive the meaning of that Text to be this, there ſhall be a manifeſtation of the wrathfull preſence of God to them, and that ſhall be their puniſhment; the preſence of the Lord is everlaſting life, and light, and joy to his owne people; but the preſence of the Lord ſhall be terrible and dreadfull, even everlaſting deſtruction to wicked men; they ſhall at laſt Conſider it ſo much, that they ſhall feare to purpoſe. God will powre out ſuch a preſence upon them as they ſhall be equally unable to hide themſelves from or ſtand before, but muſt lie downe and ſinke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it into the bottomleſſe gulfe of deſpaire for evermore. If the Godly are ſometimes afraid, where ſhall the wicked appeare, when God appeares. <hi>When I conſider</hi> (with <hi>Job) I am afraid of him.</hi>

                     </note>This verſe is neere in ſence with the former. <hi>Job</hi> herein further ſhewing both a reaſon why he was afraid of God, as alſo the effect which Gods dealing with him had upon his owne heart, or how he was affected with it. For
<q>God maketh my heart ſoft.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word rendred, <hi>to make ſoft,</hi> ſignifies the abateing of the ſtrength of the heart.</p>
                  <p>But it may be enquired, what was this ſoft heart which God made him?</p>
                  <pb n="457" facs="tcp:153845:242"/>
                  <p>I anſwer; Firſt, Negatively, by a ſoft heart here wee are not to underſtand a penitent heart, or a heart broken with Godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row at the ſight, eyther of ſin acted or wrath threatned. (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.19.) The Lord ſaith by the Prophet to <hi>Joſiah, Becauſe thy heart was tender (ſoft or melted) and thou haſt humbled thy ſelfe before the Lord, when thou heardeſt what I ſpake againſt this place, therefore</hi> &amp;c. The heart of fleſh promiſed and given in the new Covenant, is a relenting and repenting heart (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26.) <hi>I will take away the heart of ſtone, and give you an heart of fleſh;</hi> that is, I will make your heart ſoft, which before was hard. <hi>Job</hi> had ſuch a heart, a ſoft heart in this notion, when he ſpake thus, but that's not the heart here meant; God had given him that ſoftnes of heart before; for he is deſcribed (<hi>Chap.</hi> 1.1.) <hi>A man that feared God;</hi> and a man that feareth God, is a man of a ſoft heart. (<hi>Prov.</hi> 28.14.) <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth alwayes, but hee that hardneth his heart ſhall fall into miſchiefe.</hi> Where the hard heart and the feare of God are oppoſed; For whereſoever the true feare of God is in the heart, that is a ſoft heart.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By a <hi>ſoft heart,</hi> is not here meant the patient heart; that's a ſoft heart in Scripture, a heart which is willing to ſubmit to and beare the burden that God layes upon it: in this ſence God makes the heart ſoft, when, as he accuſtomes his to ſufferings, ſo he fits them to ſuffer. Man naturally is (like <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Jer. 31.18.) <hi>As a Bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoake,</hi> both of active and paſſive obedience. Onely God makes man ſubmit his ſtiff neck and hard heart to a ſuffering condition, and to anſwer the call of his ſufferings. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is ſayd to have a <hi>hard heart,</hi> becauſe he did not yeeld to what God called him to by Judgements, he had not a patient but an unquiet ſpirit under the plagues ſent upon him, nor did he obey what he was ſummoned to by the Lords voyce in thoſe terrible plagues. Now, though I grant that an heart made ſoft in patience is an excellent frame of heart, yet wee cannot underſtand it ſo here; for <hi>Job</hi> had a patient heart, yea he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of patience before, as he fully diſcovered at the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and breaking out of his troubles; he did not flinch at the Croſſe, but did embrace it. The Apoſtle exhorts all Chriſtians to <hi>Remember the patience of Job.</hi> And wee muſt apply that Scripture to <hi>Job</hi> before he came to this poynt. Therefore the ſoftnes of heart intended in this text is ſomewhat beſides this.</p>
                  <pb n="458" facs="tcp:153845:243"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, Much leſs are wee to underſtand by <hi>a ſoft heart,</hi> a <hi>fearefull</hi> or <hi>a Cowardly heart;</hi> that's a ſoft heart indeed, but in a bad ſence. Wee have it ſo expreſſed (<hi>Deut.</hi> 20.3.) <hi>Heare ô Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, you approach this day unto Battell againſt your Enemies, let not your hearts be faint,</hi> &amp;c. The Hebrew is, <hi>let not your hearts be ſoft or tender:</hi> a ſoft heart is not for a ſword, nor for a battel. How ſhall they ſtand in dangers, who are fallen below them? A penitent heart, and a patient heart are proper in dangerous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, but a cowardly heart is the greateſt diſadvantage in the world; therefore the Lord commanded this to be proclaimed to his people, <hi>Let not your hearts be tender when yee goe forth againſt your Enemies,</hi> or as it is expreſt afterward; <hi>Feare not, neither trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, neither be yee terrified becauſe of them. Job</hi> had not ſuch a ſoft heart, he was no coward when he complained before, <hi>that the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Almighty did encamp againſt him as a dreadfull Army,</hi> nor while he ſayd here, <hi>God hath made my heart ſoft.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, A ſoft heart, is an effeminate, delicate, wanton heart. There are too many who have ſuch ſoft hearts. Men that are fit for nothing but what is worſe then nothing, to wallow in the ſinfull delicacies and delights of this preſent world. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle uſeth a word (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9.) which expreſſeth this fully. Wee render it <hi>effaeminate,</hi>

And <hi>Moſes</hi> applyes the very word of <hi>Jobs</hi> text to this kinde of ſoftnes (<hi>Deut.</hi> 28.56.) <hi>The tender (or ſoft) and delicate woman, that would not adventure to ſet the ſole of her foote upon the ground for delicatenes and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, (or ſoftnes) her eye ſhall be evill towards</hi> &amp;c. This is not onely a ſinfull ſoftnes of heart,<note place="margin">Liquefecit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictionibus &amp; conſumpſit. <hi>Merc:</hi> Haec mollitudo pertinet ad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morem vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quo quis corde &amp; mente cedit divinae majeſtati &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teſtati, cum quis facile recipit cogitationem et metum ſupernae magnitudinis.</note> but the worſt of ſinfull ſoftneſſes. <hi>Jobs</hi> heart was farre from this ſoftnes. As he was at that time a man of ſorrows, ſo he had not been at any time a man of pleaſure. But if <hi>Jobs</hi> ſoft heart were none of theſe, what was it then?</p>
                  <p>I conceive the ſoft heart proper to this place is, <hi>a heart weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and laid low through the burden of affliction.</hi> A heart ſo worne out and ſpent that it can hardly beare any more. God had ſoftned and even conſumed his heart with ſorrow and affliction. As he abhorred a hardnes of heart to reſiſt the hand of God, ſo now he feared that his heart was not hard enough to beare it with that chearefulnes and conſtancy of courage which he deſiered. Hard things are firme, compact, and knitt together; thoſe that are ſoft,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:153845:243"/> are weake and unable to beare any weight. So that <hi>Jobs</hi> ſoftnes of heart was his weaknes to beare;<note place="margin">Teneritatem &amp; imbecillitatem affert animo meo attendenti ad omnipotentiam ejus. <hi>Jun:</hi>
                     </note> And he gives this as an account why he was afraid of the power of God in any new ſufferings. <hi>O</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>God hath made my heart ſoft;</hi> that is, I begin to faint, I finde my ſelfe drooping, I have not that ſtrength of ſpirit (and though I am not a coward, yet) I have not that courage, that hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or hardines of ſpirit which I have had heretofore. He queried indeed (<hi>Ch.</hi> 6.12.) <hi>Is my ſtrength the ſtrength of ſtones, or is my fleſh braſs?</hi> He had much ſtrength, but not the ſtrength of ſtones, nor was he hard as braſs. Now he ſaith plainly, my heart is made ſoft, it mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth like wax at the fire; I am ſo litle like braſs or ſtones in ſtrength or hardnes, that I am altogether like wax or water. I am ſo far from having a minde to ſtrive with, or riſe up againſt God, that I know not how to ſtand before him, if he (which he ſeems to intend) ſhould ſtill goe on to afflict me. I am growne weake and unable to beare, yet my burden remaines, and will probably be made yet more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie. This interpretation carrieth a diſtinct ſence in it, and that which is moſt genuine to the ſcope of the place. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Broughtons</hi> tranſlation of the latter clauſe of the verſe, ſuites this expoſition of the former with much clearenes; <hi>For the Omnipotent hath ſoftned my heart, and the Almighty hath made me ſhrinke. Whereas wee ſay the Almighty troubleth me,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>The Almighty hath made me ſhrinke:</hi> For ſo a man commonly doth who eyther feares or feeles that which he is not well able to beare.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <q>The heart of a Godly man, even of the moſt Godly, may be ſo weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned under long continued ſufferings, that he may finde himſelfe utterly unable to beare them any longer.</q>
                  <p>Wicked men labour to ſtrengthen and harden themſelves all they can, to beare, in oppoſition to God, and Saints would ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and harden themſelves all they can to beare in ſubmiſſion to God. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> hardened his heart to oppoſe God ſtriking him; hee had ſtroake after ſtroake, and Judgement after Judgement, yet he would not yeeld; but at laſt God made his heart ſoft in one ſenſe, though hee hardened it in another. God appeared at laſt too hard for <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> hee could hold out no longer. And we finde the Lord ſpeaking thus by <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to his people, who (it ſeemes by the language which God uſeth concerning them) had,
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:153845:244"/> as it were, ſet themſelves with unholy reſolutions to ſtand or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtout it out with God, and beare the worſt that hee could doe unto them; <hi>But</hi> (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.14.) <hi>can thine heart endure? or can thine hands be ſtrong in the day that I ſhall deale with thee?</hi> When I deale with thee in wayes of Judgement, when I take thee in hand to puniſh and repay thee according to thy workes, can thine heart endure? no! it cannot endure, it ſhall not be able to endure. The Lord doth not meane it of an endureing with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and patience; So it is the honour of Saints to endure what ever God layes upon them, but to endure with ſtoutnes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; art thou able to ſtand it out, or can thine hand be ſtrong? no, thy heart and hand will be ſoft and weake, thou wilt not be able to beare it when I come to deale with thee. It is ſayd of Chriſt by <hi>David</hi> his type (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.13.) when hee was under thoſe terrible ſufferings for our ſins, that his heart was made ſoft (and if it were ſo with the greene tree, what muſt it be with the dry?) <hi>I am powred out like water, and all my bones are out of joynt: my heart is like wax, it is melted in the midſt of my bowells.</hi> Thus the ſufferings of Chriſt our head (who was alſo the Captain of our ſalvation, and the mighty God) made his heart ſoft and mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him. His heart was not melted with ſorrow for his owne ſin, (for he was without ſin) but the ſorrow that was upon him for our ſins melted his heart. Whoſe heart will not melt &amp; grow ſoft, (that is, unable to beare it) when God layeth his hand heavy and long upon him? Therefore we r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Whats the reaſon of it? not but that God is able to continue his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, and to carry on his warre, whether with perſons or with Nations for ever; but he hath reſpect to the poore Creature; <hi>for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I will not doe it, leſt the ſpirit ſhould faile before mee, and the ſoules which I have made.</hi> How can ſoules faile? the ſoule is an immortall ſubſtance, and ſhall not faile for ever. The ſoules of the damned ſhall be under everlaſting Contendings, and never faile, they ſhall beare wrath for ever and not faile, yea their bodyes ſhall not faile, but through the power of God (ſuſtaining them under his Juſtice) ſhall endure everlaſting torments. The meaning of that expreſſion in the Prophet, is the ſame with this in the Text,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:153845:244"/> 
                     <hi>Their heart will be made ſoft;</hi> as yet they have ſtrength, faith, and courage to beare theſe afflictions, but if I continue them longer, their ſpirit and ſtrength, their faith and patience will faile, and be ſo worne out that they will not be able to abide it. <hi>God would not Contend for ever,</hi> leſt (as <hi>Job</hi> here complaines) he ſhould make their hearts ſoft.</p>
                  <q>And the Almighty troubleth mee.</q>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>Here <hi>Job</hi> gives another reaſon of his being thus troubled at the preſence of the Almighty. <hi>It is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>becauſe I was not cut off before the darknes;</hi> or, <hi>becauſe I dyed not by thick darknes</hi> (ſo M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Broughton</hi>) we ſay, <hi>becauſe I was not cut off,</hi> hee, <hi>becauſe I dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not;</hi> both meete in the ſame meaning. For death is a cutting off, and death will cut off or mow downe the ſtrong, yea the ſtrongeſt, as the ſith doth eyther corne or graſſe. Thus ſpake <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in his ſicknes (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.10.) <hi>I ſayd in the cutting off of my dayes,</hi> that is, when I thought I lay a dying. <hi>Job</hi> was troubled becauſe <hi>he was not cut off.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Before the darknes, <hi>or,</hi> from the face of darknes.</q>
                  <p>Death it ſelfe is darknes,<note place="margin">Quòd me non interemerit, au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferens a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectu non tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam hanc cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginem &amp; tot mala. <hi>Merc:</hi>
                     </note> and yet <hi>Job</hi> would faine have dyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the darknes. There is a darknes of affliction and trouble ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of often in this booke and elſewhere, which is more bitter to man then death it ſelfe. Some had rather be taken out of the
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:153845:245"/> world, then endure the troubles of it. This is the firſt part of the reaſon, <hi>I am troubled,</hi> why? <hi>becauſe I was not cut off before the darknes,</hi> or before this trouble came; As if he had ſayd, <hi>I ſhould have been glad, or it had been good for me, if death had prevented theſe troubles; this troubles mee that I dyed not, that I went not to the grave before theſe troubles came upon mee.</hi> Thus <hi>Job</hi> gives way againe to his paſſion; hee broke out much in this ſtraine or lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage at the third Chapter, where at large he openeth his wiſh for death, either that he had dyed before, or preſently after hee was borne into this world, that hee might have been at reſt, and ſo out of the reach of thoſe evills and calamities that did encamp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt or beſet him round about. The reader may conſult what hath been done upon that Chapter, of which this verſe is an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, and there finde the nature of this wiſh for death explained, as alſo what lively deſires <hi>Job</hi> had of death, or as this text ſpeakes, that, <hi>he had been cut off before the darknes.</hi> I ſhall here onely take notice; That to ſome, the ſorrowes of this life are much more bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then death it ſelfe; yea that God himſelfe hath ſometimes in a way of mercy and favour called ſome out of the world before he would let great troubles in. There was a promiſe made to <hi>Joſiah</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> that, God being reſolved to bring trouble upon that people, yet he ſhould be <hi>cut off before the darknes.</hi> (2 Kings 22.20.) <hi>Becauſe thy heart was tender,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Behold therefore I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou ſhalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, and thine eyes ſhall not ſee all the evill, which I will bring upon this place.</hi> And when <hi>Ahab</hi> had humbled himſelfe before the Lord, even he went not without a reward for it, and his reward was this (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.29.) <hi>I will not bring the evill in his dayes.</hi> Hee ſhall be <hi>cut off before the darknes. Jerom</hi> ſpeaking of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that came upon the Church,<note place="margin">Foelix Nepotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus qui haec non vidit. <hi>Hier:</hi>
                     </note> doth as it were applaud the death of <hi>Nepotian</hi> upon that Conſideration, <hi>Happy he that dyed before theſe troubles lived.</hi> It hath ſomewhat of mercy in it, to goe out of the world before extraordinary affliction comes in; yet in theſe things wee muſt take heed of being our owne Carvers; it is one thing to have a promiſe from God, that the Cloud ſhall not breake in our time; and another thing for us to wiſh and deſire to be out of the world before the Cloud breakes: The former ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth the tendernes and care of God towards us, but the latter muſt needs argue eyther our unwillingnes to ſuffer eyther from or
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:153845:245"/> for God; Or our diſtruſt of his aſſiſtance and preſence with us to ſupport us in our ſufferings. If God will not cut us off by death before the darknes, wee ſhould be willing to live in the darkeſt darknes of outward calamity that ever fell upon this world. <hi>Job</hi> adds a ſecond reaſon of his troubled ſpirit in the laſt words of this verſe and Chapter.</p>
                  <q>Neither hath he Covered the darknes from my face.</q>
                  <p>I am troubled becauſe I have lived in troubleſome dayes, but though I have, yet God could have hidden me from thoſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, or thoſe troubles from me; but as hee hath let me live in the darknes of trouble, ſo he hath not at all covered the darknes of ttouble from me. I doe not onely live in troubles, but I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes looking troubles in the face. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Broughton</hi> renders thus, <hi>Nor he yet hideth gloomines from my face;</hi> which he alſo paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in theſe words; <hi>Becauſe I finde neyther death nor eaſe of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that I ſhould not feele theſe afflictions.</hi> So that as he complaines becauſe he dyed not before the darknes came; ſo becauſe God did not hide the darknes from him when it came, but let him have ſuch ſad viſions of it. This ſtill imports that <hi>Job</hi> had not that fullnes of ſubmiſſion to the diſpenſations of God, as duty called him to; and for this <hi>Elihu</hi> reproves him; yea God himſelfe chid and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked him, becauſe he tooke upon him ſo often <hi>to give the rule,</hi> and did not ſit downe more quietly under his appoyntment and portion for him. Though <hi>Jobs</hi> patience was great, yet he had not all patience, or all of patience. And though, I doubt not, but his patience had a perfect worke, yet he did not attaine to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of patience. This (according to our tranſlation) is the ſence and ſumme of theſe words, concerning which many things have been ſpoken in the former part of the Booke, whether I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the reader: yet before I paſſe them quite out of my hands, I ſhall gather up ſome other Renderings of this verſe, and leave them to the readers Judgement and conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Thus; <hi>when I was onely not Cut off by darknes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Nam ubi tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum non exciſus ſum propter te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebras a facie mea ſe operit caligine. <hi>Coc:</hi>

Secondly, that outward troubles are then moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to us, when God hides or withdrawes his preſence from us.</p>

                     </note>Another reading gives it as an admiration; <hi>I am exceedingly troubled becauſe I was not cut off by the preſent darknes, and that he hath turned away darknes from my face:</hi> As if <hi>Job</hi> had ſtood won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that his life was thus prolonged; that his ſicknes and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes had not made an end of him; that ever hee ſhould continue ſo long in ſuch a ſtorme as hee had done, and who or what power it was that in thoſe his great preſſures, both of minde and body, did hinder or ſtay him from being covered with the ſhadowes and darknes of death.</p>
                  <p>A third renders; <hi>Becauſe hee hath not cut mee off through dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Calvin.</note> 
                     <hi>but hid darknes from my face;</hi> and he gives the meaning of it thus; the reaſon why I am ſo much troubled and afflicted, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath not <hi>cut mee off through darknes;</hi> that is, becauſe I have not had ſome ſecret or private affliction, but all the world hath taken notice of what hath been done to mee. God hath not chaſtned mee in the darke; theſe things have not been done to me in a corner. <hi>Job</hi> might ſpeake as the Apoſtle, <hi>I am made a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to the world, to Angels and men,</hi> all beholding mee in this piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full condition. And this occaſions mee much trouble of minde, becauſe as I ſee plainely, that the hand of God is gone out againſt mee, ſo all others ſee it too, and they make ſeverall Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it. Had I been loſt in the darke I ſhould have borne it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, now I am made the common talke of the world, and how to anſwer their deſcants upon my condition, is more then a little trouble to mee. This tranſlation hath a faire ſence as to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:153845:246"/> truth; but the textuall Conſtruction (as they who are skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſull in the Grammer of the Hebrew know) will not beare it. And therefore I ſhall ſtay in our owne tranſlation, which is faire and cleare as to the ſcope of the Chapter, ſhewing this good mans paſſion, breaking forth into ſome kinde of quarrell with the diſpenſations of God, becauſe hee was not carryed out of the world before theſe troubles came in, or if hee muſt needs ſtay, and be contemporary with them, becauſe hee found no cover, no ſhelter from eyther the beholding or feeling of them.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have done with the firſt part of <hi>Jobs</hi> Anſwer to the third and laſt aſſault which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> made upon his Innocency; But as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpake much againſt him, ſo he could not be ſatisfied to ſpeake but a little for himſelfe; He had more to ſay, both for his owne vindication, and the refutation of his opponent. What he ſayd, the twenty-fourth Chapter will tell us, which comes next in order to be opened.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Chapter containeth the ſecond part of <hi>Jobs</hi> anſwer, to <hi>Eliphaz:</hi> the generall ſcope whereof, is to pull up the foundation of his friends ſuſpition of him, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute againſt him, ſhewing that many men doe much evill in this life, who ſuffer none, and that many who are innocent, ſuffer much evill, and are not releived: from both he concludeth, that the ſuffering of evill can be no concludeing argument that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man is ſo; for then it muſt be ſo with all men, which moſt mens experience contradicteth.</p>
               <p>So that here <hi>Job</hi> falls downe-right upon the poynt in debate, affirming what he had often affirmed before, that God both in aſſerting the innocency of the righteous, and in puniſhing the ſins of the wicked, uſeth much variety; and that his proceedings with the ſons of men, are ſo farre from being alwayes open, and plaine, that uſually they are very ſecret, concealed, and ſo much in the darke, that there is no print of his ſteps to be found. This ſeemes to be the deſigne and tendency of the whole Chapter; and the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of it may be formed thus;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yee, my friends have ſaid, that God puniſheth all evill doers in this life; ſeing then he knoweth the length and continuance of their dayes in this world, why doth he yet ſuffer them to ſlip out of this world un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed. And if they are ſo frequently puniſhed in this world (as ye affirme) why doe not they who know God ſee it, and take notice of it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſo it is, that many wicked men ſlip out of the world unpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and the godly who know him doe not ſee judgement executed, therefore ſurely it is not the way of God preſently in this life to puniſh every offendour; nor can yee conclude that they who are afflicted are
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:153845:247"/> wicked, ſeing many of his people are not onely afflicted by himſelfe, but lie under the rod of the wicked a long time unrevenged and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the whole Chapter we may obſerve theſe three parts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, A queſtioning propoſition in the firſt verſe, <hi>Why ſeing times are not hidden from the Allmighty, doe they that know him, not ſee his dayes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, We have the confirmation of this propoſition, and that in two branches; Firſt, of innocent perſons not releived; ſecondly, of wicked perſons not puniſhed; Thirdly, he concludes his whole diſcourſe in the laſt verſe of the Chapter by a ſtronger affirmation of what he had ſaid before; <hi>And if it be not ſo now, who will make me a liar, and make my ſpeech nothing worth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, More diſtinctly in this Chapter, we have the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in the firſt verſe; ſecondly, the confirmation of it, made by an enumeration, of many groſſe ſinnes, which wicked men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and feele no ſmart, but paſſe unpuniſht; and thoſe ſinnes are either, firſt, againſt man, or ſecondly, againſt God.</p>
               <p>Againſt man, firſt, by removing of the Land-markes in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verſe; ſecondly, violently taking away of cattell, in the third verſe. Thirdly, turning the poore out of houſe and home, in the fourth verſe; fourthly, lying in waite and watching their oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to rob &amp; get their prey like wilde beaſts, at the fifth verſe; fifthly, reaping and carrying away other mens corne out of the fields by violence, at the ſixth verſe; ſixthly, uſing all manner of oppreſſion upon the poore, 7, 8.9, 10, 11, 12 verſes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Job</hi> diſcovers their rebellion againſt God, &amp; their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his wayes: for though both theſe be included in the former acts (whoſoever ſins againſt man, ſins againſt God too) yet there are ſinnes that are more peculiar and immediate againſt God. And of theſe he ſpeakes at the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>They rebell againſt the light;</hi> againſt the light of the knowledge of God ſhining with much evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and clearenes, both in his word and in his workes; And then takes occaſion more perticularly to deſcribe, firſt, the murderer, and his darke wayes, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. Secondly, the adulterer and his dark wayes, (<hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16, 17.)</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Job</hi> ſheweth, that though the wicked doe all this, and are not preſently puniſhed, yet that they are under a ſecret curſe, which ſhall ſurely overtake them (<hi>ver.</hi> 18, 19, 20.)</p>
               <pb n="468" facs="tcp:153845:248"/>
               <p>Fourthly, Upon this, he againe revives the mention of their ſinne; firſt, againſt the poore, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. Secondly, againſt the rich, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. Together with their puniſhment, though late, yet at laſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 23, 24.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, He re-aſſerts all that he had ſayd, by challenging all men to diſprove him (if they could) in what he had ſayd, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. So much of the ſtate and generall ſcope of the whole Chapter.</p>

                     </note>This (as a learned interpreter gives his opinion of it) is a hard Text, and there are various renderings of it. I ſhall touch upon them, and then draw out that which may be ſuteable for obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The whole verſe may (as ſome conceave) be rather read thus; <hi>Why are not times hidden from the Almighty, ſeing they that know him doe not ſee his dayes?</hi> The meaning of which tranſlation is this; it might make a man that is not well inſtructed in the wayes and providences of God, to thinke that God takes no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the times that paſſe, nor of the things done here below, ſeing the beſt of his ſervants could never yet make it out, that he puniſheth ungodly men according to their deeds in this world. Surely then we may ſay, That times are hidden from God, for were it not ſo, godly men could not but ſee his dayes, his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-dayes upon the wicked, and things would not be in ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and diſorder as they are. So that <hi>Job</hi> either ſhewes what men doe ordinarily conclude from Gods indulgence and patience towards the wicked, and his ſeeming ſlacknes and ſlownes in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging the wrongs of his owne people, even that as God is in heaven, ſo thicke clouds are a covering to him there, and that he ſeeth not what is acted on the earth. As if eyther the Lords eye did not reach this inferior world, or that he would not trouble himſelfe about it. <hi>Surely times are hidden from the Almighty,</hi> or</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes his owne paſſions, and temptations about this poynt; As if he had ſayd, <hi>I am tempted to thinke that times are hidden from the Almighty, becauſe he doth not ſend preſent releife to his people, nor preſent wrath upon his enemies.</hi> Such temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are diſcovered in other Scriptures, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.2.) <hi>My feete</hi>
                     <pb n="469" facs="tcp:153845:248"/> (ſaith <hi>David) had almoſt ſlipt when I ſaw the proſperitie of the wicked,</hi> when the wicked and unholy were not puniſhed preſently according to Juſtice, he was urged and tempted to think that God did not regard juſtice, nor declare himſelfe in his holines as he ought. And though the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> durſt not queſtion the righteouſneſſe of God, yet he knew not (in this caſe) how to give an account of it, as hath been noted heretofore from his queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings (<hi>Jer.</hi> 12.1, 2.) <hi>Why doth the way of the wicked proſper?</hi> &amp;c. And with this the following parts of the Chapter ſeeme to carry a fayre correſpondence, wherein he enumerates many groſſe prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes &amp; impieties of wicked men, notwithſtanding which they paſſe out of this world in worldly peace.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, One of the antient Rabbins reads the words as a wiſh,<note place="margin">Quare non ſunt abſcondita, <hi>q. d.</hi> aequio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Times are not hidden from the Almighty, yet they that know him are ignorant of his dayes;</hi> and the reaſon why they leave out the interrogation is given thus; becauſe they thought there was a kinde of impiety, yea blaſphemy in it to ſay or querie, <hi>Why are not times hidden from the Almighty?</hi> As if <hi>Job</hi> muſt in ſaying ſo either af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that times were indeed hidden from the Almighty, or that he wiſhed they were. Therefore to avoide that inconveniency they turne it into a direct negative propoſition; <hi>Times are not hidden from the Almighty.</hi> And many of the Jewiſh Writers ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at the ſame ſtone, have judged <hi>Job</hi> as denying the providence of God, or his care of times, and ſeaſons here below; but (upon divers occaſions) <hi>Job</hi> hath been vindicated concerning this poynt, therefore I ſhall not ſtay upon it.</p>
                  <p>A fifth tranſlation gives it thus; <hi>If times are not hid, by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, how comes it to paſſe that they that know him doe not ſee his dayes?</hi> as if he had ſayd, were it not for this, or were it not thus, that God doth hide times, or that times are hidden by God, that is, that Gods providences are carried in ſecret, and run a great while (as ſome rivers doe) as it were under-ground, it could not be, but that they that know him, that is, wiſe and holy men (as we
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:153845:249"/> ſhall ſee afterward) ſhould ſee the effects, and iſſues of thoſe judgements. The judgements of God (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) are delayed in their execution or executed in ſo ſecret a way, that they are moſtly and to the moſt of men undiſcerned. Wherein he fully oppoſeth what <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſayd (<hi>Chap.</hi> 20.16.) <hi>They are cut downe out of time;</hi> that is, they are preſently cut downe, no, ſayes <hi>Job,</hi> God hideth their times, that is, he puts ſtops and delayes upon the times of his revenge; or as he ſpeakes (<hi>Chap.</hi> 21.19.) <hi>He layeth up wrath for his children, but themſelves are not preſently cut downe.</hi>

                     <hi>Broughton.</hi> As if he had ſayd, <hi>What rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be given of this, why times are not hidden by the Almighty? or why ſhould it not be thought right, and juſt, that times ſhould be hidden by the Almighty? who can queſtion God if he will hide times and judgements, or who ſhall ſay, it is unequall?</hi> The Hebrew par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>(Min)</hi> ſignifies as well <hi>by</hi> as <hi>from,</hi> we ſay, why <hi>ſeing times are not hidden from the Almighty;</hi> they ſay, <hi>why ſhould not times be hidden by the Almighty?</hi> This rendering beares a cleare and a profitable ſence, and therefore I ſhall give this obſervation from it.</p>
                  <q>God doth hide times from men.</q>
                  <p>The providences of God and their ſeaſons are not carried plaine to every mans eye; and why ſhould not times be thus hidden by the Almighty? God doth not hide that time from us wherein we ought to doe our worke (he ſheweth us plainely not onely what we ought to doe, but when we ought to doe it, to every worke there is an appoynted time, and the preſent time, is our time for moſt workes, yea for all thoſe workes which have a proper ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to eternity) but though God doth not hide the times from us wherein we ſhould doe our worke, yet he doth often hide the time from us wherein he will doe his own worke, and why ſhould he not? he hides the time wherein he will puniſh the wicked, and breake the power of his enemies, and he hides the time wherein he will revive his owne people, and deliver the afflicted. There are ſometimes which God keepeth,<note place="margin">Inſita eſt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talibus incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis quaedam ea quae futura ſunt praenoſcendi cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piditas.</note> and will keepe <hi>in his owne power;</hi> as Chriſt told the Diſciples (<hi>Act.</hi> 1.6, 7.) when they asked him, <hi>Lord, wilt thou at this time reſtore againe the kingdome unto Iſrael? It is not for you to know the times or the ſeaſons which God hath put
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:153845:249"/> in his owne power.</hi> That is, which he hath not put forth or diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the ſonnes of men. All times are in Gods power, but thoſe which he reſerves from men, and keepes under lock and key, theſe he hath more eſpecially put in his power. God will not let thoſe times appeare to men, wherein himſelfe is purpoſed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. The time of thoſe workes of God are wrapt up in greateſt darkneſſe when they ſhall be done, which being done ſhine forth with greateſt light and; God will have it ſo.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To reprove and ſtop the curioſity of man; There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more naturall to man then a deſire to know both what ſhall be hereafter, and when that hereafter ſhall be: we are very negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and careleſſe in ſeeking out the ſeaſon of that which we our ſelves ſhould doe,<note place="margin">Homo eſt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal curioſum.</note> but over-carefull and curious in ſeeking out the ſeaſon of what God will doe. Man is given to vaine curioſity, and he is in nothing more vainely curious, then in an itch to know the times which God hath hidden from him. Moſt men are great queſtioniſts, and their queſtions moſtly are about times, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, when ſhall this, and that be? The Diſciples of Chriſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered this ſpirit more then once; When Chriſt had told his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that of thoſe Goodly buildings to which they admiringly poynted him, <hi>There ſhould not be one ſtone left upon another, that ſhould not be caſt downe</hi> (Math: 24.2.) They a while after <hi>came unto him privately, ſaying, tell us, when ſhall theſe things be, and ſhall be the ſigne of thy coming, and of the end of the world?</hi> It did not ſatisfie them that Chriſt had told them ſuch ſhould be, unleſſe he alſo tell them the time and ſeaſon when they ſhould be. The Apoſtle found this humour ſtirring much in the Church of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> for having ſpoken of the reſurrection of the body, and that then <hi>the Lord himſelfe ſhall deſcend from heaven with a ſhout, with the voyce of the Arch-Angel, and with the trump of God</hi> (1 <hi>Thoſ.</hi> 4.15, 16.) He, to prevent their inquiſitivenes about the time when this ſhould be, begins the fifth Chapter thus; <hi>But of the times and ſeaſons brethren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yee have no need that I write unto you.</hi> Which implies, that either they had intimated ſuch a querie to him, deſiring to be acquainted with the time and ſeaſon of thoſe things, or that he foreſaw they would be enquiring and making it their next queſtion, <hi>when ſhall theſe things be?</hi> when ſhall the deceaſed Saints be raiſed, and the living caught up, when ſhall Chriſt deſcend from heaven with a ſhout, &amp;c? Some have made
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:153845:250"/> it their ſtudy to unvaile the times which God hath hid, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his ſecrets. And it is no part eyther of the honour or orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe times,<note place="margin">Mathematico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum &amp; gene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liacorum veſana temeritas.</note> that Aſtrologers and Mathematicians have been ſo bold in theſe ſtudyes. As if the ſtarres of heaven were ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther betruſted with the ſecrets of the God of heaven, or being ſo would be unfaithfull Secretaryes, bewraying his ſecrets, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe times and ſeaſons into the power of man which God hath put into his owne power. Ancient hiſtoryes tell us that the Princes of the world have been very greedy after this forbidden, or at leaſt unrevealed knowledge. Being more deſierous to know what ſhould come to paſſe in after times, then diligent in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the preſent time; Whereas indeed, which is</p>
                  <p>A ſecond reaſon why it is ſo, God therefore hides the iſſues and events of future times, that we might be kept to preſent duties, to the work and buſineſſe of the day. He conceales from man the preciſe day of his death, that he might every day be preparing to dye. If men had all times in their hands, they would quickly lay the greateſt and beſt part of their worke out of their hands.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God hideth times to try the faith of his own people, whether they can depend upon him in the darke; whether when they know not when the time ſhall be, or what a day may bring forth, they can yet freely truſt him for all their dayes. He that lives by faith at all times, troubles not himſelfe about what ſhall be next in time, nor what the next times may be.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, God hideth times, that we may be guided by rules, not by events; That we may ſteere our courſe through this world according to his divine appoyntments, not according to humane ſucceſſes. Upon all theſe and many more accounts, <hi>why ſhould not times be hidden by the Almighty?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I ſhall proceed with our reading, to open that, and give ſome notes from it.</p>
                  <q>Why ſeeing times, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>As if <hi>Job</hi> had ſayd, ſeing the Lord knoweth all times, ſeing times are not hidden from him, what is the reaſon why thoſe who know him, and are neereſt to him, doe not know times alſo? or thus; God knoweth times, they are not hidden from him, why doe not they know times that know him?</p>
                  <p>We are not to take time here nakedly or naturally as it notes
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:153845:250"/> dayes, moneths, and yeares, meaſured out by the motion of the Sunne, Moone, and Starres; but time is to be conſidered provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially as cloathed with all the varieties of action and event, which are imaginable, as incident to the affaires of mankinde in this life.</p>
                  <q>Why ſeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>When <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Seing times are not hidden from the Almighty,</hi> his meaning is, that Times are clearely and fully knowne to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</p>
                  <p>The whole verſe taken together ſeemes to be a deniall of what is in it ſelfe very probable; for ſeeing God knoweth times,<note place="margin">Poteſt eſſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gata connexio cauſae probabilis cum effecto. <hi>Coc:</hi>
                     </note> it is moſt probable that they who know him ſhould know times too: for to whom ſhould God communicate his ſecrets, but to thoſe who are neere to him, to thoſe that are his: As if he had ſayd; <hi>Give me a reaſon, if you can, why God, to whom all things and times are knowne from eternitie, ſhould not make knowne theſe times to thoſe that know him?</hi> And ſo the argument may be formed in this manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Such as know God, ſhould know his dayes, if any know them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But they that know God, doe not know his dayes;</hi> therefore God keepes his dayes cloſe to himſelfe; ſo that whereas <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <hi>Job</hi> as doubting the providence of God (<hi>Chap.</hi> 22. <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13, 14.) and asks the queſtion, <hi>ver.</hi> 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, <hi>Haſt thou marked the old way, which wicked men have troden. Job</hi> anſwers here, I deny not the providence of God, but I deny that all the wayes of Gods dealing with wicked men, are obvious to the eye of Godly men, and ſhew me reaſon, if you can, ſeing God knoweth all times, why the way of his judgements are ſo little viſible to them <hi>which know him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But who are they that are deſcribed by this circumlocution, <hi>They</hi> (or the men) <hi>that know God?</hi> We may take them in a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold notion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, More Generally for all godly men, for all who are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch know God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, More ſpecially for thoſe Godly men who know God more then others; there are ſome who have a peculiar knowledge of him, and dayly intimacy with him, who live as it were in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and ſee what is in his breaſts, comparatively to others.</p>
                  <pb n="474" facs="tcp:153845:251"/>
                  <p>And further (becauſe words of knowledge comprehend the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in Scripture) by thoſe that know him much, we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thoſe that love him much, that delight in him much, that feare him much, and obey him much. Now though we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this text of truely Godly men at large, yet the latter ſort are chiefly meant: why ſeeing times are not hidden from the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, doe not they that know him, godly men, yea his favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, who know moſt of his minde, who as they are after his heart, ſo in his heart eminently, why doe not they who know him thus, <q>See his dayes?</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Why ſeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, doe they that know him not ſee his dayes?</hi>

                  <p>From the former part of the verſe, Note.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That times are knowne, perfectly knowne to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea not onely are times perfectly knowne to God, but firmely fixed and moſt wiſely diſpoſed of by him; men may know that which they have no power to diſpoſe of; but the knowledg of God and his power run paralel through all times and things. So that as when the text ſayth, <hi>Times are not hidden from the Almighty,</hi> it notes that they are fully knowne to him, ſo alſo that they are uncontrouleably diſpoſed, and ordered by him. And as times are knowne to God, ſo he makes them knowne when and to whom he pleaſeth. When <hi>Joſeph</hi> had revealed to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> both the matter and the time concerned in his dreames, then (ſaith <hi>Moſes, Gen.</hi> 41.45.) <hi>Pharaoh called Joſephs name Zaphnath paaneah,</hi> which ſay ſome ſignifies in the Egyptian language, <hi>The Saviour of the world:</hi> Which name, ſay they, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> might give him, becauſe by his advice in laying up ſtores of corne in the yeares of plenty, ſuch a world of men, or ſo great a part of the world, was ſaved from periſhing by famine in the yeares of ſcarcity. But, ſay others, deriving the word from an Hebrew roote, it ſignifies <hi>a revealer of ſecrets.</hi> Which title of honour <hi>Joſeph</hi> well deſerved, and was moſt proper to him, ſeing he had revealed that Great ſecret unto <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> both that there ſhould be a famine, as alſo the time and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it. But where had <hi>Joſeph</hi> this ſecret? was it from any aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall skill of his owne? He tells us plainely whence it was at the 15th and 16th verſes of the ſame Chapter; for when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had ſayd to <hi>Joſeph; I have heard ſay of thee that thou canſt underſtand a dreame to interpret it;</hi> He preſently anſwers, firſt, Negatively, <hi>It is not in me;</hi> and then affirmatively, <hi>God ſhall give Pharaoh an anſwer of peace.</hi> See the like in that moſt remarkeable paſſage (<hi>Den.</hi> 2.17, 18, 19, 20, 21.) From all which we learne that God knoweth times and changeth times, that is, makes great changes in times according to the counſell of his owne will.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If we take time, for the ſucceſſion of dayes, weeks, months, yeares, and ages, thus the Lord knoweth times. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the dayes of man, the preciſe number of the yeares and ages wherein any worldly ſtate or power ſhall continue, are not hidden from him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Times are not hidden from God, as times are taken
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:153845:252"/> for the ſeaſons and opportunities of action. The Lord knowes what time will be as a wheele or as a ſocket fitted for the carrying on or eſtabliſhing of every worke. We are often troubled at this, and miſſe our ſeaſon, but God knoweth every ſeaſon, he knoweth the times, and therefore can time every worke exactly. And the Hebrew word here uſed,<note place="margin">

We neyther love nor feare him of whom we have no knowledge; nor can we beleeve in or truſt him, whom we know not. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10.) <hi>They that know thy name, will put their truſt in thee;</hi> That is, the truly godly will truſt in thee, for they know thy name, but they that know thee not, how can they truſt upon thee? and therefore the Prophet calls us to boaſt in, the knowledge of God. (<hi>Jere.</hi> 9.23.) <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſdome, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches, but let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he underſtandeth, and knoweth me, that I am the Lord whech exerciſe loving kindneſſe, judgement, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe in the earth, for in theſe things I delight ſaith the Lord.</hi> There is nothing in this world worth the boaſting in, but the holy knowledge of a holy God, or ſuch a knowledge of God, the fruit whereof is a godly life here, and the end whereof is an eternall life hereafter. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3. <hi>This is eternall life, that they may know thee the onely true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> This know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God doth not floate in the braine, but ſinkes into the heart, and is rooted in the affections. Thus the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues (1 <hi>Epiſt. Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6.) <hi>Hereby we know that we know him, if we keepe his Commandements, he that ſayth he knows him, and keepeth not his commandement is a liar, and the truth is not in him;</hi> As if he had ſayd, The true knowledge of God is an obedientiall knowledge, ſo that if any man ſayth he knoweth God, while his life is not ſutable to what he knoweth, this mans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is vaine, and himſelfe is a lyar; <hi>Whoſoever keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected,</hi> that is, he loveth God with a perfect or ſincere love, and the love of God is perfected towards him. The ſcope of his whole diſcourſe there is to ſhew that the true knowledge of God is the keeping of the word of God. Many are ſo ignorant of God, that they know not the word which they ſhould keepe, and all they who knowing the word keepe it
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:153845:253"/> not, will at laſt be numbered among the ignorant, or among thoſe that know not God: But their condition will be worſe, and their puniſhment greater then theirs who never knew God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the teachings of his word. Their eſtate will be bad enough, who periſh for want of the knowledge of God, then, what will their end be, who periſh in the neglect or abuſe of plentifull know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge!</p>
                  <p>From the ſecond notion of the words, <hi>they that know him,</hi> as they intimate a ſort of Godly men, who have neerer acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with, and freer acceſſe to God then others.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>That as all godly men know God, which the wicked doe not, ſo ſome godly men have ſuch a knowledge of God as many who are godly have not.</q>
                  <p>Though the knowledge of all godly men be of the ſame nature and kinde, yet not of the ſame degree and height. We reade of ſome who in old time were called <hi>Seers</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.9.) as if they onely had been endued with ſight, and all others were blinde in the things of God. They were the onely <hi>ſeers,</hi> yea they <hi>were fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers,</hi> becauſe God did often reveale himſelfe, and declare to them what he was about to doe in dreames and viſions. Now as in thoſe times there were ſome men called <hi>ſeers,</hi> ſo in theſe times ſome may be called <hi>knowers,</hi> as if none knew any thing of God comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them, or as if other godly men were ignorant and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood nothing of him. When God (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.) appeared to <hi>Samuel</hi> in a viſion, and revealed the doome of <hi>Elies</hi> houſe to him; the Text ſayth, at the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord;</hi> ſurely <hi>Samuel</hi> did know the Lord as other godly did in thoſe times, though he were but young; yea it is ſaid, <hi>The childe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel miniſtred before the Lord;</hi> and did not he know the Lord? no doubt he did. The meaning therefore is, <hi>Samuel</hi> did not yet know the Lord by any ſpeciall intimacy with him, or particular revelation from him, as afterward he did; he became <hi>a knower of God</hi> at laſt, though then <hi>he did not know God,</hi> in this peculiar ſence. But God having revealed to him the ſecret what he would doe to <hi>Elies</hi> houſe, then he knew God, he knew him as a favourite, that is truſted with ſecrets. So <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.14.) <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is with them that feare him.</hi> There is a ſecret in
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:153845:253"/> the plaineſt truths and doctrines of Godlines, both in Law and Goſpel; and many know the doctrine, who know not the ſecret; any common profeſſor may know the doctrine, but the ſincere onely know the ſecret, that is, the power and efficacy, the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of comfort of the doctrine. There is alſo a ſecret of God with his in bleſſing and proſpering them in the world; of which <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes (<hi>Chap.</hi> 29.4.) as there is alſo a ſecret and imperceptible curſe, which the Prophet calls the Lords blowing upon what men have in their poſſeſſion, or for their uſe (<hi>Hag.</hi> 1.9.) But beſides theſe there is a ſecret of favour, which is the ſealing of the Spirit, the gift of the hidden Manna, and of the white ſtone, with a new name in it, which no man knoweth ſaving he that receiveth it (<hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17) This ſecret of the Lord is with them that feare him; and there is yet another ſecret of his with them, even the ſecret of his purpoſe and intendment concerning his owne providentiall workings. Which while many or all ſee, yet they know not the meaning of them, I meane it not onely of the wicked and carnall, but even of many who are holy and ſpirituall in the maine. The ſecrets of providence are knowne onely to ſome choyce ones, to ſome of an excellent Spirit and high attainements, to ſome <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams,</hi> &amp;c. intimate friends, who are to God as his owne ſoule. There is a ſecret of the Lord, which is with all them that feare him, yet ſome of his ſecrets are not with many of them who feare him. What <hi>Job</hi> ſpake in the 12th Chapter of this Booke, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. reproving the pride of his friends; <hi>Yee are the men, and wiſdome ſhall dye with you;</hi> you (I trow) have ingroſſed all wiſdome, and others muſt borrow of you; The ſame we may ſpeake ſoberly and approvingly of ſome humble Godly men, <hi>they have the knowledge of God,</hi> and it is but little that others have, though they have a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledge. Some conceive the Prophet upbraiding the Jewes (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.2.) As if they affected to be looked upon, not onely as ſuch as know God, but as ſuch as know him intimately, and were his boſome friends. <hi>They ſeeke me dayly, and delight to know my wayes, as a nation that did righteouſneſſe, and forſooke not the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of their God, they aske of me the Ordinances of Juſtice, they take delight in approaching unto God.</hi> They who doe indeed, as theſe <hi>Jewes</hi> ſeemed to doe, may be numbred among thoſe of the higheſt forme that know God. <hi>Why doe they that know him, not ſee his dayes.</hi>

                  <p>Here <hi>Job</hi> hath found out ſomewhat knowable, which they who know God, doe not alwayes know; and that is, as hath been ſhewed, the ſeaſon of his judgements.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The judgements of God are often eyther deferred, carried ſo cloſely, and ſecretly, that the wiſeſt and holyeſt men cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes diſcerne or ſee them.</q>
                  <p>The judgements of God are often deferred in this life, and they are very often concealed, though preſently executed. That is not alwayes true which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> aſſerted (<hi>Chap.</hi> 22.19.) <hi>The righteous ſee it and are glad, the innocent laugh them to ſcorne.</hi> The righteous ſometimes ſee the judgements of God upon wicked men, &amp; his care watching over themſelves, but they do not alwayes ſee eyther; for as a wicked man may doe evill a hundred times, that is, very often, and goe unpuniſhed, as is intimated (<hi>Eccl.</hi> 8.12.) So a wicked man may be puniſhed a hundred times, and yet not one of his puniſhments ſeene. Some judgements of God are great and ſore, which yet fall not under the obſervation of the beſt, of the wiſeſt, of the holieſt in the world; <hi>They that know him, doe not ſee his dayes;</hi> God (for terror and warning to others) doth judgement upon ſome openly (<hi>Deut.</hi> 7.9, 10.) <hi>Know therefore the Lord thy God, he is God, the faithfull God, who keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him, and keepe his commandements to a thouſand generations, and repayeth them that hate him, to their face to deſtroy them; He will not be ſlacke to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.</hi> Here are two things in this Text concerning the judgements of God; That they ſhall come, firſt, ſuddenly; ſecondly, openly; they ſhall come ſuddenly, <hi>God will not be ſlack,</hi> they ſhall come openly, <hi>God will repay them to their face;</hi> as they ſinned openly, ſo they ſhall be puniſhed openly. Thus God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payd the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> he payd them to their face; ſo he repayd <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> and ſo the rebelling <hi>Jewes;</hi> and <hi>he was not ſlack,</hi> (for as the Pſalmiſt ſaith) <hi>while the meate was in their mouth, the wrath of God fell upon them.</hi> Thus 'tis ſometimes: yet judgements are often deferred, and hidden. What the Apoſtle ſpeakes (<hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22.) is applicable here; <hi>God willing to ſhew his wrath, and make his power knowne, indured with much long ſuffering the veſſells of wrath fitted for deſtruction;</hi> there are veſſells of wrath fitted for deſtruction, throwne to hell, not onely to a temporall, but to an eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction;
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:153845:254"/> yet God did indure them with much long ſuffering; that is, he did not preſently powre out wrath upon them, he was ſo farre from caſting them preſently to hell, that he did not afflict them with any trouble in this life, but indured them with much long ſuffering, and patience. <hi>David</hi> was much aſtoniſhed with this conſideration (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.6.) <hi>Thy righteouſneſſe is like the great mountaines, thy judgements are a great deepe.</hi> Take both together; <hi>Thy righteouſneſſe is like the great mountaines, the mountaines of God,</hi> that is, thy righteouſneſſe indures, and remaines inviolable. But though it be ſo, yet the execution and actings of thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe are not alwayes decerneable, <hi>for thy judgements are a great deepe;</hi> that is, when God doth execute, and put forth his righteouſneſſe, few ſee it, his <hi>judgements are a great deepe,</hi> many deepes, who can goe to the depth of them? <hi>how unſearchable are thy judgements?</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33.) they are ſuch and ſo deepe that none can reach the bottome of them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no wonder if <hi>they are ſometimes hidden from thoſe that know God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whereas <hi>Job</hi> ſayth, <hi>Why ſeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, doe they that know him, not ſee his dayes?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may Note.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>That,</hi> if any thing which God doth in this world be ſeene by any, Godly men are in the Greateſt likely-hood to ſee it.</q>
                  <p>And that upon a twofold ground; firſt, becauſe they have the beſt eyes, and ſences moſt exerciſed to diſcerne what God is do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

For as God by the Spirit expounds his word, ſo his workes to his choyceſt ſervants. <hi>Shall I hide from Abraham</hi> (ſayd God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.17.) <hi>that thing which I doe.</hi> And ſo the Lord ſaith to the ſpirituall children of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> unto this day, Shall I hide from them eyther what I am about to doe, or the meaning and ſcope of what I have done? If any in the world ſee the dayes of God, Saints ſhall. So that we may conclude, if they ſee them not, that eyther they are not yet come, or that God purpoſely concealed their comming. Both or eyther of which may be the minde of <hi>Job</hi> in this place.</p>
                  <pb n="482" facs="tcp:153845:255"/>
                  <p>Laſtly, Conſider the text as a queſtion, <hi>Why, ſeeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, doe they that know him not, ſee his dayes?</hi> What is the reaſon of this? <hi>Job</hi> here anſwers <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> who thought that the judgements of God were ever open, and obvious to all beholders; but as it is not ſo, ſo what is the reaſon of this? why is it not ſo? I have heretofore given an account of theſe <hi>whyes and wherefores,</hi> of theſe queſtions about the diſpenſations of God. Yet here I anſwer further, God is pleaſed to cover or defer his Judgement dayes. Firſt, becauſe it is his pleaſure to doe ſo, that's anſwer enough for man, it is his pleaſure. Times are not hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from God, but muſt he needs make us acquainted with all times, or ſhew us the way of his judgements preſently; no, it is his pleaſure to doe otherwiſe, and it is his priviledge to diſpoſe of times, ſeaſons, actions, and judgements as he pleaſeth; who may ſay to him, what doeſt thou? or why doeſt thou ſo? he is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame, and ſoveraigne, if he will have it ſo, why ſhould any one oppoſe it, or riſe up againſt it?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If it be demanded, Why are not the wicked preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhed, ſeeing God knoweth times, and ſeaſons, and how all things paſſe among the ſons of men? I anſwer, God will leave wicked men more inexcuſable, the more patience is exerciſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, the more long ſuffering God is to them, the more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent will the juſtice of God be in their ſufferings, and they will have the leſſe, or rather nothing at all to plead for themſelves. The leaſt ſin committed by man, may ſtop his mouth, how much ſoever hee is puniſhed by God; how much more may their mouthes be ſtopped, who continued to ſin greatly, while God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to ſpare them long in their ſin?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The day of the wicked mans ſuffering comes no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſuddainly, that the patience of the Saints may be tryed, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed. There are three things which chiefely exerciſe the patience of the Saints. Firſt, the Greatnes of their owne troubles; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the ſlownes of their deliverance out of trouble: Thirdly, the long proſperity of wicked men, or the long deferring of their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Theſe delayes and ſtops in the vindicative adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God <hi>towards evill men,</hi> give the graces of his ſervants pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent worke, and God often forbeares purpoſely to put forth his power, that Saints may put forth their patience, or that it may be ſayd of them as in the booke of the Revelations, <hi>Here is the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:153845:255"/> of the Saints,</hi> in this the patience of the Saints is viſible. Faith and patience can never have ſo fit an opportunity to be ſeene, as when the Juſtice of God in avenging them, and in puniſhing the wicked is leaſt ſeene. Yea therefore it is that they doe not ſee thoſe his dayes with an eye of ſenſe, that they might ſee them with an eye of faith. While the Prophet ſaith (<hi>Hab:</hi> 2.4.) <hi>The juſt ſhall live by his faith;</hi> He ſpeakes in reference to the deferring and delaying of judgements upon the enemies of the Church; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares fully in the firſt Chapter (<hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13.) <hi>O Lord, thou haſt ordained them</hi> (namely, the Chaldean Empire) <hi>for Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> (that is, to puniſh and afflict thy Church, the Jewiſh Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) <hi>and O mighty God, thou haſt eſtabliſhed them for correction;</hi> As if he had ſayd, <hi>Thou O Lord, didſt not intend the ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of thy people, by arming and ſending this bitter and haſty Nation againſt them, but onely their amendment and repentance; yea thou haſt no pleaſure at all in theſe Chaldeans, by whom thou haſt powred out thy diſpleaſure upon thine owne people.</hi> For, as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes; <hi>Thou art of purer eyes then to behold evill, and canſt not looke on iniquity, to approve of it, or to be pleaſed with it, and ſeeing thou canſt not; wherefore lookeſt thou upon them that deale treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, and holdeſt thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man, that is more righteous then he?</hi> That is, why doeſt not thou O Lord, take vengeance ſpeedily upon theſe evill and treacherous ones? The Prophet having propoſed &amp; urged this queſtion to the Lord, What doth he next? you may ſee that at the firſt verſe of the ſecond Chapter; <hi>I will ſtand upon the watch and ſet me upon the tower, dnd I will watch to ſee what he will ſay unto me, and what I ſhall anſwer when I am reproved,</hi> or (as the Hebrew hath it) ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued with, by carnall men, or the turbulent paſſions of my own ſpirit? The Lord giveth him his anſwer at large (<hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3.) which is ſummed up (<hi>v.</hi> 4.) in this briefe direction or aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>But the Juſt ſhall live by his faith.</hi> As if he had ſayd, proud men will be querying, yea quarrelling, when they ſee my provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences croſſe my promiſes, or my workes carrying a preſent face of unſutablenes to my word. When things goe thus, they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently offended &amp; nonplus'd, they know not what to make of it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be to make me <hi>a lyar,</hi> as ſpeaking, what I meant not to doe, or <hi>impotent,</hi> as ſpeaking more then I had ability to doe; But, my people know how to ſatisfie theſe doubts with a ſaving to my
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:153845:256"/> honour; <hi>The Juſt ſhall live by his faith.</hi> And they who live by faith will not have uncomely thoughts of me, whatſoever it is that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to their ſight: or though that which they hoped would appeare be ſtill kept out of their ſight. Though, <hi>they that know him, ſee not his dayes,</hi> with an eye of ſence, yet they ſee them by an eye of faith, and <hi>by that faith they live.</hi>

                  <p>So then the reaſon why they who know God, or the Godly, ſee not his dayes, is not becauſe God is not able to bring a day of vengeance upon wicked men, it is not becauſe he beares any good will to them, but to exerciſe the faith and patience of his people. That's the ſcope of this firſt verſe, which layeth downe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition by way of queſtion, times are not unknowne to God, yet they that know him doe not ſee his dayes, his judgement dayes, as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had before aſſerted. In the next part of the Chapter, <hi>Job</hi> goes on to prove by an enumeration of particulars, that many ſorts of wicked men goe on in all ſorts of ſinne, who yet feele not the day of God upon them.</p>

The Lord ſpeaks of his holy people (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.15.) <hi>Touch not mine anointed, and doe my Prophets no harme.</hi> Another word is uſed in the <hi>Pſalme,</hi> but we may give the ſame emphaſis here, <hi>ſome touch the land-marks,</hi> as if it were a fault ſo much as to handdle, or meddle with them: yet the word here uſed ſignifies both to touch, and to take, and ſo to take, as violently to carry away. (<hi>Zech.</hi> 1.6.) <hi>Did not my word take hold of your fathers;</hi> that is, did it not apprehend, and ſeaze upon them, yea remove them out of the land of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. Where the word of God toucheth, it taketh away, eyther to deſtruction or ſalvation. And that word in the Prophet hath a double alluſion, either to the hunting of beaſts, or to fighting, and contending with men; the word followed your fathers, it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke them, it tooke them, it laid hold on them, as the hunter layeth hold upon his prey, or as an enemy follows, and over-takes a fleeing enemy, <hi>did not my word take hold of your fathers?</hi> yes, it did, and that to purpoſe. The word is uſed (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.12.) <hi>Mine iniquities</hi> (ſayth <hi>David) take hold of me, ſo that I am not able to looke up;</hi> they have dealt with me, as with a fugitive, that runneth away; They have taken hold of me, and they hold me faſt, my ſinne hath apprehended me. So that, though this originall word ſignifies <hi>to touch,</hi> yet it is ſo to touch as to offer violence, to take away, to remove, as is expreſſed in thoſe inſtances (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.8.) <hi>David inquired of the Lord, ſaying, ſhall I purſue after this troope, ſhall I over-take them;</hi> ſo (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.14.) <hi>David ſaid to all his ſervants that were with him at Jeruſalem, ariſe let us flee, for we ſhall not eſcape from Abſolom, make ſpeed to depart, leaſt he overtake us ſuddenly.</hi> In which places as this word is uſed, ſo the uſe of it is about violent and forcible actings, ſo that this touching is tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or removing; they <hi>remove</hi> or <hi>pull</hi> up the land-marks, to ſet
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:153845:257"/> them in ſome other place for their owne advantage. This was their firſt ſin, the removing of <hi>land-marks;</hi> which was upon the matter to take away propriety, and to put all men out of poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. There can be no poſſeſſion without diſtinction;<note place="margin">Mira fuit in antiquis tum in conſtituendis tum in ſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis limitibus fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des at<expan>

The care and induſtry of the ancients was exceeding great and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate about their land-marks, both in ſetting them up, and in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving them, that every man might have his owne; wherefore to remove the land-marks, was indeed to take away the land.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>That,</hi> God hath given unto man a proper, ſpeciall, and perſonall right in his lands, and goods.</q>
                  <p>If it were not ſo, then, firſt, it were no ſinne to remove land-marks, or a vaine thing to ſet them up; if there be no diſtinction of inheritances by propriety, what needs there be any diſtinction, by marks, or limits, to ſhew, this is ſuch a mans land, and that anothers. No man may ſet a ſpeciall marke, where he hath not a ſpeciall right. Secondly, if there were no propriety, there could not be ſuch a ſinne as ſtealing, and theeving: that which is every mans, any man may take, and be blameleſſe. Thirdly, if there were not propriety, there would be but little induſtry; If mens lands and goods were not their owne, who would be found to take care of them, or paines about them. Fourthly, to make all things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, were to run all into confuſion. There is nothing more une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall then this kinde of equality. If all had a like right in the things of the world, all would thinke to have a like power in the government of the world. <hi>Propriety and Magiſtracy muſt ſtand and fall together.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſome may object that practice of the primitive Church (<hi>Acts</hi> 2.44.) who had all things common. And if all things with them were in a community, where was propriety?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt, This practice of theirs was purely voluntary, not at all impoſed; as appeares plainely from the words of <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Ananias (Acts</hi> 5.4.) <hi>While it remained, was it not thine owne;</hi> or more cloſe to the Greek, <hi>Remaining did it not remaine to thee;</hi> that is, it was properly thine before thou ſoldeſt it, and thou mighteſt have kept thy intereſt in it. No man compelled thee to ſell or give, and if thou hadſt not ſold it, thou mighteſt ſtill have held commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:153845:258"/> with the Church for all that; But this is thy ſin, to pretend the gift of all to God, and performe but in part.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, ſecondly, That community did not extend to the whole eſtate of all beleevers, but to what they did conſecrate to releive the publicke neceſſity; For if they had put themſelves quite out of all propriety by one gift, they could not have exerciſed their charity any more. Whereas the Apoſtle directs them to a conſtant uſe of their charity in making collections for the poore (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1, 2.) And ſurely <hi>Paul</hi> had made a vaine profeſſion when he ſayd; <hi>I have coveted no mans ſilver, or Gold, or apparell, (Act.</hi> 20.33.) if no man had any peculiar propriety in gold, ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or apparel.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It appeares from the 44<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, that even they who ſold their goods retained ſome kinde of right in them; for all did not come to the common banke, and take what they pleaſed; but they who ſold their poſſeſſions parted the price to all men, allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to every one a proportion as he had need. It was not ſhare and ſhare like, every man was not his owne carver out of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke ſtocke, but diſtribution was made, as neceſſity required. God doth to this day keepe the eighth commandement in full force and ſtrength, as a Fence or hedge about the worldly eſtates of men, and he that goes about to breake this Hedge, a Serpent ſhall bite him, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes (<hi>Eccl.</hi> 10.8.) Hedges are Land-markes; And both are, not onely arguments, but ſecurers of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety.</p>
                  <p>Againe, Seeing land-markes were ſet up to diſtinguiſh mens eſtates.</p>
                  <p>We learne.</p>
                  <q>That we ſhould uſe all due meanes to prevent contentions about worldly poſſeſſions.</q>
                  <p>As every man hath a title and a right to his owne, ſo every man ſhould have a rule whereby to know his owne; peace is a ſacred and precious thing (even peace about civill things) and therefore whatſoever makes for peace ſhould be accounted ſacred and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious. Bleſſed are the peace-makers, but more bleſſed are the peace-preſervers. It is good to heale breaches among Brethren, but it is better when there are none. Preventing phyſicke is more deſierable then reſtoring.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, Note.</p>
                  <q>To remove land-makes, which are the meanes of preſerving the poſſeſſions of men diſtinct, and ſo of preſerving their right and peace, is very ſinfull.</q>
                  <p>This is a ſin condemned by the light of nature, as well as by the light of Scripture;<note place="margin">Numa pompili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us ſtatuit ut li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceret eum tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ſacrilegu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> occidere qui vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olare, jus termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni auſus eſſet.

And if any man in tilling the ground, plowed up the land-marke, himſelfe and his oxe were both ſacred, that is, both were to be ſlaine or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to death; yea the <hi>Romans</hi> were ſo intent, and devout about this thing, that they had a ſpeciall God <hi>of the bounds or limits ſtones.</hi> And as the old heathens, judging by the rule of common reaſon, and light of nature, did abhorre this practice, ſo the holy Scripture in the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> provides directly and by name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. (<hi>Deut.</hi> 19.14.) <hi>Thou ſhalt not remove thy neighbours land-marke which they of old times ſett, in thine inheritance, which thou ſhalt inherit, in the land that the Lord thy God giveth thee to poſſeſſe it.</hi> And againe (<hi>Deut.</hi> 27.17.) <hi>Curſed be he that remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth his neighbours land-marke, and all the people ſhall ſay Amen.</hi> A <hi>curſe</hi> containes all penalties, and <hi>Amen</hi> ſeales them all upon the perſon of the offender. <hi>Solomon</hi> renewed theſe lawes (<hi>Prov.</hi> 22.28.) <hi>Romove not thy neighbours land-marke, which thy fathers have ſet.</hi> And againe (<hi>Prov.</hi> 23.10.) <hi>Remove not the old land-marks, and enter not into the feild of the fatherleſſe.</hi> Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> caution'd thoſe times againſt this ſin. And the Prophet (<hi>Hoſea</hi> 5.10.) makes this ſinne as the Standard of all other ſinnes, or as that by which we are to take the greatneſſe and weight of any ſinne; if a ſinne comes neere to this, or be like this, 'tis a great ſin. <hi>The Princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound, therefore I will powre out my wrath upon them like water;</hi> As if he had ſayd, the Princes of <hi>Judah</hi> are extreamely wicked: how wicked? even as wicked as they which remove the bound. Now if high-growne wickednes be but ſuch a thing as removing the bound, how high is their wickednes growne, who remove the bound? But it may be demanded what bound doth the Prophet meane? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:153845:259"/> it may be underſtood of all ſorts of bounds, of the bounds of lawes, of the bounds of liberty, of the bounds of religion, as alſo of the bounds of lands. It is wickednes to meddle with or remove any of theſe bounds, though to remove ſome of them be a greater wickednes. To remove the bounds of the lawes, and the liberties of a Nation, eſpecially to remove the bounds of religion, are hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous abominations and though; to remove the bound of lands, be not ſo bad as theſe, yet that alſo may be numbred among the abominations which both God and man hate; and therefore when the Prophet would in one word ſpeake all the abominable practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Princes of <hi>Judah,</hi> he choſe to ſay, they are like thoſe who remove the bound; implying that nothing could be ſayd of them worſe then that. The ſame Prophet uſeth an expreſſion ſomewhat paralel to that (<hi>Hoſea</hi> 4.4.) where deſcribing the wickedneſſe of thoſe times, he tells them, that <hi>the Lord had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with the land, becauſe there was no truth, no mercy, no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God in the land, by ſwearing, and lying, and killing, and ſtealing,</hi> &amp;c. then at the 4th verſe, he concludes, <hi>Let no man ſtrive, and reprove another.</hi> ('Tis the ſoareſt judgement of God upon a people or a perſon to let them alone and be quiet in their ſinne, to ſay, <hi>Let no man ſtrive, and reprove another</hi>) but why did God give up that people to ſuch a judgement? The greatnes of their ſin was the cauſe of it; And what was that; the next words ſhew us; <hi>For thy people are as they that ſtrive with the Prieſt.</hi> It was ſo great a wickednes to contend or <hi>ſtrive with the Prieſt,</hi> that the vileſt of wickedneſſes was but an exemplification of it. God forbids that they ſhould be reproved or ſtriven with for good, who were once growne ſo evill as to ſtrive with the Prieſt; and the greateſt reproofe that can poſſibly be gives any man, is to ſay, <hi>let no man reprove him.</hi> Thus we ſee that to <hi>ſtrive with the Prieſt, and to remove the bound,</hi> are ſins of the firſt magnitude, the one in Spiritualls, the other in Civills.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In as much as the word here uſed ſignifies not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quite to remove, but to touch or medle with the land-marks.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>That we ought to avoide all thoſe acts, that are leading to ſinne, as well as the ſinne it ſelfe.</q>
                  <p>It was not abſolutely a ſinne, or a ſinne in it ſelfe, to touch or
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:153845:259"/> come neere the land-markes, but becauſe this had an appearance of evill in it, and becauſe while men handled the bounds, eyther it might come into their minds to remove them, or they might poſſibly remove them a little againſt their minds, therefore even that act is forbidden, as having in it a tendency to that ſinne. It is good for us to keepe at the furtheſt diſtance we can from that which is evill. The Apoſtles rule is, <hi>Abſtaine from all appearance of evill,</hi> (1 Theſ. 5.22.) unleſſe all the appearances of all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches unto evill be abſtained from, we ſhall hardly abſtaine from the evill it ſelfe. <hi>Solomon</hi> gives a like caution (<hi>Pro.</hi> 23.31.) <hi>Looke not upon the Wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth it ſelfe aright.</hi> It is not a ſinne to looke upon the wine, yet <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>looke not upon it;</hi> why? becauſe that act may occaſion another; while you looke upon the wine, you may be taken with the beauty and colour of it, and ſo drinke intemperately; for he adds, <hi>it will bite like a Serpent;</hi> which implyes that looking may enſnare a man, and cauſe him to drinke more then he ought, and then the wine will bite indeed; wine will goe downe without chewing, but he that lets too much goe downe ſhall finde it biting. And 'tis more dangerous and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous to be wine-bitten, then to be ſerpent-bitten; therefore looke not upon the wine. So here, touch not the land-marks, be not buſie about them, ſtand off from them, leſt you be enticed to remove or take them away; <hi>They that will alwayes doe the utmoſt of what is lawfull, may ſoone be overcome to doe that which is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi> It is our wiſdome as wel as our duty, not to touch that, which to take away will be our ſin.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, When <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Some remove the land-marks;</hi> That is not the onely thing intended, though it be onely here expreſſed; for this removing had a further purpoſe: as touching comes to removing, ſo removing the land-marks goeth further, even to the taking away of the land. And they therefore tooke away the land-marks, that they might take away the land alſo; they tooke away that which diſtinguiſhed their lands from other mens lands, that ſo other mens lands might be accounted theirs, and that they might enter upon the poſſeſſion of them as their owne. Thus, to colour and cover their covetouſnes and oppreſſion in invading o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens lands, they removed the markes whereby they held and claimed their lands. It were not worth the while to remove land-markes,
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:153845:260"/> unleſſe it were for the lands ſake. The value of a ſtone, or of a peice of timber, or of a Turfe of earth (any of which may be made a land-marke) is not conſiderable, but the land marked by it, is. The heart of man is cunning and full of contrivance to compaſſe ſinfull ends by ſuch wayes, as may keepe the ſin (as much as may be) unſeene. Forceably to take away lands were groſſe, but firſt to take away land-marks, &amp; ſo to rayfe a queſtion, or make it a controverſie to whom the land belongs, this is a peice of oppeſſion ſpunne with a finer threed. This is robbing without ſeeming to doe wrong. <hi>Some remove the land-markes,</hi>

                  <p>I will have it, ſayth he; and if he be ſtrong enough have it he will. The Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> gives ſuch a character of the Princes of thoſe times (<hi>Chap.</hi> 3.10.) <hi>They know not to doe right, ſayth the Lord, who ſtore up violence and robbery in their pallaces.</hi> 'Tis ſad for a people when Princes or <hi>they who dwell in pallaces, know not to doe right,</hi> eſpecally when their <hi>know not,</hi> is not, an Ignorance of the Law, but a willfull perverſion of the Law; when their <hi>know not to doe right,</hi> is they have no minde nor will to do right; when Princes <hi>are wiſe</hi> (enough, too wiſe) <hi>to doe evill, but to doe good they have no knowledge;</hi> ſuch were they of whom the Prophet complained in that place, <hi>they know not to doe right.</hi> And what are ſuch like to doe then? The Prophet tells us what; <hi>They ſtore up violence and robbery in their pallaces;</hi> that is, all the furniture and riches of their pallaces, are but robbery, and violence, or ſuch things as they have taken away by violence, and robbery. The Lord therefore threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens ſuch, that they ſhall be ſcourged with violence, (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.11.) <hi>Violence is riſen up into a rod of wickedneſſe, none of them ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, nor of their multitude, nor any of theirs, neyther ſhall there be wayling for them.</hi> Violence riſeth up to a rod of wickednes two wayes. Firſt, as violence ſhootes or puts forth from wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as a branch or rod ſhootes forth from the ſtocke of a tree; all the violence and oppreſſion that ever was committed in the world, is both branch and fruit growing or riſing up from a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked heart. Secondly, Violence riſeth up into a rod of wickednes, when violence puniſherh wickedneſſe; they who have afflicted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by violence, often finde violence turned into a rod to afflict themſelves. And we may give that ſence of <hi>Solomons</hi> Proverbs, (<hi>Pro.</hi> 13.2.) <hi>The ſoule of the tranſgreſſour ſhall eate violence.</hi> The words are a threat. As wicked men eate violence, that is, what they have gotten by violence; ſo they ſhall have violence to eate, that is, they ſhall be violently dealt with; eyther violence ſhall compel them to doe their duty, or violence ſhall puniſh them for not doing it, or, as they lived by violence, ſo they ſhall die by violence. <hi>The ſoules of tranſgreſſours ſhall eate violence,</hi> as a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, becauſe (as it followes in the next clauſe) they eate vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence as their portion. <hi>They violently take away flocks,</hi>
                     <q>And feed thereof.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Original words are rendred two wayes. Firſt, as we, <hi>They
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:153845:261"/> feede thereof;</hi> that is, they feed themſelves with the flocks which they have taken away; Secondly, <hi>They fed them;</hi> that is, they feede the flocks which they have violently taken away. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our tranſlation the ſence is this, when they have taken away flocks violently, they ſit downe quietly and feed themſelves with theſe flocks, they and their families are maintained by the ſpoyle. And I conceave <hi>Job</hi> adds this, not onely to ſhew another or a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond act of their ſin, but to ſhew the reſolvednes and ſetlednes of theſe men in the wayes of ſin.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>Then a wicked man is hardned in ſinne, when he feeds, and filleth himſelfe with what he hath ſinfully gotten.</q>
                  <p>They not onely act evill, but delight in evill, who <hi>take away any thing by violence, and feede thereon. Solomon</hi> ſpeakes of ſome (<hi>Pro.</hi> 4.17.) <hi>Who eate the bread of wickednes</hi> (that is, bread (by which is meant all the neceſſaryes of this life) gotten by wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes) <hi>and they drinke the wine of violence;</hi> that is, the wine which they have gained by violence, or ſuppoſe what they have violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gained be not wine, in ſpecie, or that liquor which we call wine, yet they drinke it as wine, like ſweete and pleaſant wine. This is a ſigne of a heart ſetled in ſin, when the ſinner eates his ſinne as bread, and drinks it as wine. What ſtomacks have they who can digeſt ſuch hard-meates; and though now they ſeeme to make a good digeſtion of it, yet unleſſe they vomit up ſuch morſels and draughts by true repentance, they will lye heavie upon their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks, and make them heart-ſick to Eternity. The Prophet threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.14.) <hi>That the Lord will enter into judgement with the antients of his people, and the Princes thereof, for</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>ye have eaten up the vineyard, the ſpoyle of the poore is in your houſes;</hi> that is, ye maintaine your houſes by that which is not yours, even by the ſpoyles and vineyards of the poore. When <hi>Jezabel</hi> had got <hi>Naboth</hi> ſlaine, ſhe preſently ſayd to <hi>Ahab, Ariſe, take poſſeſſion of the vineyard of Naboth,</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> did ſo (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.15, 16.) But the Lord ſent <hi>Eliah</hi> to him with this Meſſage (<hi>ver.</hi> 19.) <hi>Haſt thou killed and alſo taken poſſeſſion?</hi> As if he had ſayd, Art thou indeed ſo hardned in ſin, that thou canſt goe downe and pleaſe thy ſelfe in the uſe and poſſeſſion of what thou haſt gotten ſinfully? how wicked art thou, who art ſo farre from having thy
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:153845:261"/> heart to ſmite thee with ſorrow, for ſmiting a faithfull ſubject of thine to death by thy Authority, that now thou canſt delight thy ſelfe in eating up the vineyard of the dead man. Sometimes a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man ſins by inordinate deſires after the creature, but 'tis very rare, that his ſtomacke doth not turne before he comes to eate his ſinne. <hi>David</hi> (2 Sam. 23.16.) had a longing deſire to the waters of <hi>Bethlem,</hi> and upon the making knowne of his deſire, three mighty men broke through the hoaſt of the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> and fetched him the water; but (<hi>ver.</hi> 16.) when the water was brought him his ſtomacke turned, he would not drinke becauſe it was gotten by the hazzard of three mens lives. For though <hi>David</hi> did not ſpeake thoſe words; <hi>O that one would give me drinke of the water of the well of Bethlem;</hi> with an intent to put any of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers upon that dangerous enterpriſe in fetching it for him; yet that he might declare how farre he was from indulging himſelfe in ſuch inordinate deſires, to engage any mans life for the pleaſing of his appetite, or ſatisfying of his preſent (though probably a very ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent) thirſt, therefore he would not drinke it, but powr'd it out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord; ſaying, <hi>Farre be it from me O Lord, that I ſhould doe this, is not this the bloud of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives?</hi> Thus it is with tender conſciences, who though they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſpeake and doe raſhly and ſinfully, yet before they come to eate their ſinne, that is, what they have ſinfully deſiered or attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they repent and cannot make eyther meate or drinke of it. Ungodly men can drinke blood, not onely that which (as in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> caſe) others have gotten for them with the danger of their lives, but even that which themſelves have gotten with the unjuſt ſpoyle, (ſometimes) of other mens lives, but often of their lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods. <hi>They violently take away flocks, and feed thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, I ſhall touch a little upon the ſecond reading; <hi>They violently take away flocks, and feed them;</hi> that is, they doe not onely drive other mens flocks away, but keepe them openly in their paſtures, and feed them; ſo M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                     <hi>They rob away herds, and feed them.</hi> The Originall word in the Hebrew, as alſo the Latine is ſeldome uſed to ſignifie mans feeding upon dead fleſh, but often to ſignifie mans feeding of living fleſh or cattel. A Shepheard is ſayd to feed his flocke. Thus firſt they play the theeves, violently taking away their neighbours flocks; next they turne Shepheards and Graſiers and feed them openly.</p>
                  <pb n="496" facs="tcp:153845:262"/>
                  <p>This implyes three things concerning theſe oppreſſours, of whom <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That they were great men, not petty robbers, who when they have got cattle away, hide them, or ſell them off as ſoone as they can, they dare not put them in their owne paſtures, and uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they have none to put them in. But theſe <hi>Nimrods,</hi> theſe mighty Hunters take them violently, and then owne it broadly; they care not who ſees what they have done. Thus the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> reproves the Princes of <hi>Iſrael (Chap.</hi> 1.23.) <hi>Thy Princes are rebellious, and companions of theeves;</hi> that is, they doe like theeves, they oppreſſe, and vex, and violently take away. They are ſo farre (which is the duty of Princes) from repreſſing theeves, that they encourage and countenance them, and not onely ſo, but are actually Theeves themſelves. Theeves in Authority and power are the vileſt theeves; who ſhall deliver from oppreſſion, when Princes turne oppreſſors, and Great ones theeves?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When it is ſayd, that <hi>they take away flocks, and fed them,</hi> it ſhewes, that theſe robbers perſiſted in their ſin, and were not aſhamed of it. They could ſpoyle their neighbours and never bluſh. They declared their ſin as <hi>Sodome,</hi> they hid it not.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This imports that they had quiet poſſeſſion of their ill gotten goods; What they got unjuſtly, they held ſecurely and unmoleſted. Their ſtolne goods were neyther recovered by law, nor forceably retaken from them; they fed them, and kept them as their owne; wickednes proſpered in their hand; no man ſaw the day of Gods reckoning with them. This their impunity, <hi>Job</hi> ſpecially aymed at, when he ſayd; <hi>They violently take away flocks, and feed them, or feed upon them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>That God leaves ſome wicked men in a long, and quiet poſſeſſion, of what they have unjuſtly gotten.</q>
                  <p>To hold by injuſtice and oppreſſion is the worſt and moſt ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery title and tenure in the world; yet as unjuſt gaine makes ſome rich, as they improve and thrive, as they trade in, and encreaſe by wayes of unrighteouſnes, ſo they live proſperouſly, and hold ſtrongly what they have unrighteouſly gained. They both feed upon and feed the flocks which they have taken away by violence. Though ſome oppreſſors are ſo ſuddainly attached by purſuing
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:153845:262"/> vengeance, that they can neyther feed nor feed upon their ſtolne flockes, but even before the meate is in their mouthes the wrath of God and juſtice of man falls upon them &amp; will not ſuffer them to roſt what they have got in this kinde of cruel hunting, yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers roſt and eate to the full, though indeed, they doe but fat themſelves againſt a day of ſlaughter, which though it come ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will ſurely come. <hi>Job</hi> ſtill proceeds in deſcribing their other acts of violence.</p>

But if we take the word ſtrictly for one ſingle Aſſe, then it aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates the ſinne, <hi>They drive away the Aſſe of the fatherleſſe:</hi> Though he hath but one, they drive that away; this hightens the oppreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.3.) in the parable which <hi>Nathan</hi> put to <hi>David</hi> to convince him of his ſinne; <hi>He tells him of a rich man that had exceeding many flocks and herds, but the poore man had nothing ſave one little Ewe-lambe, which he had bought, and nouriſhed up, and it grew up together with him, and with his children, it did eate of his owne meate, and dranke of his owne cup, and lay in his boſome, and was unto him as a daughter: Now, when the traveller came to the rich man, he ſpared to take of his owne flocke, and of his owne herd to dreſſe for the waifareing man, but tooke the poore mans lambe,</hi> &amp;c. So here, <hi>they drive away the Aſſe of the fatherleſſe;</hi> though he hath but one, they drive that away.</p>
                  <p>Further, when he ſayth, <hi>They drive away the Aſſe,</hi> there are two things conſiderable in it. Firſt, the Aſſe is a uſefull and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable beaſt for the bearing of burthens. Secondly, the Aſſe is a <hi>meane creature,</hi> a beaſt of no great value, though of ſome uſe. They drive away the very Aſſe, and that <hi>the Aſſe of the</hi>
                     <q>
                        <pb n="498" facs="tcp:153845:263"/>Fatherleſſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the former verſe, where it is ſayd, <hi>They violently take away flocks, and feed thereof,</hi> there is no mention at all made, whoſe the flocks were, or from whom they tooke them. But here <hi>Job</hi> ſeemes to lay the emphaſis of their ſinne, not ſo much upon what they drove away, as upon the perſon whoſe it was, which they drove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; They drive away not the great or the rich man aſſe, but the aſſe of <hi>the Fatherleſſe.</hi> The word <hi>fatherleſſe</hi> may be taken two wayes, eyther ſtrictly, for a childe that is left without a father to take care of him, &amp; provide for him: or ſecondly, we may expound the word <hi>fatherleſſe</hi> more largely for any that are poore, and in diſtreſſe; as was ſhewed (<hi>Chap.</hi> 22.9.) How cruel are they, and how covetous are they, who will not ſpare the poore, no not poore Orphans! To take from the fatherleſſe in eyther ſence, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravates the ſinne. Which aggravation of their ſin is further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted in the next inſtance of their oppreſſion.</p>
                  <q>They take away the widdows Oxe for a pledge.</q>
                  <p>What a pledge is hath been opened at the 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                     <hi>Chap. ver.</hi> 6.

                     </note> therefore we finde that thoſe things which were for neceſſary uſe and livelihood, were forbidden to be taken for pledge <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.26, 27.) or if they were taken they were preſently to be reſtored before the Sunne went downe. But theſe cruel men took the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows oxe for a pledge, and reſtored him not. We may alſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it (as ſome) that they tooke the oxe as if it were a pledge, doing it as of right, or under pretence and colour of Juſtice (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her creditors) for a debt. And ſo the whole proceeding is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded eyther of tyrants, that lay heavie taxes upon the poore people, and if they are not able to pay preſently take all away by diſtreine: or of common extortioners, who lend money, or let leaſes, and upon every default of payment take the forfeiture, and carry all away as due to themſelves.</p>

                  <p>Further, we may obſerve in Scripture, that as we have theſe two uſually put together, <hi>the fatherleſſe, and the widdow,</hi> ſo we have theſe two uſually joyned together, <hi>the aſſe, and the oxe.</hi> Thus they are joyned twice in the ten Commandements, in the fourth and tenth, and often elſewhere.

Such was the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>that</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9.) <hi>though he was rich, yet for our ſakes he became poore, that we through his poverty might be rich.</hi> And ſuch is the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes of ſome men, that though they are rich enough, yet they care not to make many, who are poore enough already, poorer, that they by making them poorer, might make themſelves richer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider the matter, <hi>they drive away the aſſe of the fatherleſſe, and take the widdows oxe (or cow) for a pledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Some will ſinne for a ſmall matter, they will doe much evill,</hi> though they get but little <hi>worldly good</hi> by it, onely a ſilly aſſe, or a labouring oxe from the fatherleſſe or the widdow. Who as they never have many of theſe, commonly, but one of each (for both words are of the ſingular number) ſo thoſe that they have are uſually none of the beſt, fatteſt, ſtrongeſt, greateſt, and ſo higheſt prized ones: As the fatherleſſe, and the widdow, are poore, ſo their oxe and aſſe are but poore ones too; yet ſome will unjuſtly drive and take theſe poore things away; <hi>They will play at ſmall game</hi> (as we ſay) <hi>rather then ſit out;</hi> And act baſely to get but an aſſe. The Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> (Chap. 2.6.) repreſents the Lord proteſting againſt ſuch, thus; <hi>For three tranſgreſſions of Iſrael, and for foure, I will not turne away the puniſhment thereof, becauſe they ſould the righteous for ſilver, and the poore for a paire of ſhoes;</hi> that is, they ſould the right of the poore, when they could gett but a very ſmall advantage by it, the worth of a payre of ſhoes. Some in ſinning are like Eagles, they will not ſtoop at flyes, if they breake the rules of righteouſnes and faithfulnes, it ſhall be for a Crowne or a Kingdome. They who ſinne for the greateſt profit, make a looſing Bargaine of it: What then doe they who will ſin for the loweſt profit?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>They drive away the aſſe from the fatherleſſe, and take the oxe of the widdow;</hi> From the conſideration of the perſons wronged. Note.</p>
                  <pb n="501" facs="tcp:153845:264"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is ſinfull to wrong any, but much more to wrong the poore;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sordido lucro aſſervientes, ne calceos quidem pauperum lucri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facere recuſant, qui extremum hominibus uſum prebent. <hi>Theodoret:</hi>
                     </note> having met with this poynt from other paſſages in this booke, I onely name it, and adde, that there are two things which ſhew the ſinfullneſſe of taking from the poore. Firſt, becauſe they are weake and unable eyther to reſiſt injuries, or to right them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; They cannot helpe themſelves, nor can they eaſily procure helpe from others. <hi>The poore and him that hath no helpe,</hi> are put together (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.12.) and uſually they are the ſame. <hi>I retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> (ſayth <hi>Solomon, Eccl.</hi> 4.1.) <hi>and conſidered all the oppreſſions that are done under the Sunne, and behold the teares of ſuch as were oppreſſed, and they had no comforter: and on the ſide of their oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors there was power, but they had no comforter.</hi> And they who have no comforter, ſurely have no helper. Now it is moſt ſinfull to hurt them who are leaſt able to helpe themſelves, or finde help from others. And who ſo helpleſſe, as the fatherleſſe and the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow? Secondly, it is therefore extreamely ſinfull to wrong the poore, and eſpecially theſe poore, becauſe God hath commended them to the care, and tuition of the rich; they are his charge, God hath taken them into his protection, and hath truſted them over to men of power, that they ſhould looke to them. Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates ſhould be as a wall of defence, to the fatherleſſe, and wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, they ſhould provide for them, and nouriſh them. Therefore to ſpoyle, and rob them of all, how great a wickedneſſe is this? this is (as much as in them is) to make God a liar, and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to his word and promiſe. As then it ſhould be a great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to helpe the Godly poore, becauſe in ſo doing we are a meanes to fullfill the promiſe of God to them. So we ſhould therefore be afraid to wrong them, becauſe in ſo doing we doe what we can to make the promiſe of God to them voyd. No mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veile then, if the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> placeth all religion, as to practiſe, in the <hi>viſitation of the widdow, and the fatherleſſe in their affliction;</hi> and if, in that ſence, all religion be placed in it, what ſhall we judge of their religion, who afflict the widdow, and the fatherleſſe? And if to viſit them in trouble, be an act not onely of charity to them, but of honour and religion towards God, becauſe God (who provides for all) hath taken upon him to provide for the fatherleſſe, and the widdow, by name (So that we diſcharge Gods debt of promiſe to the fatherleſſe, and widdow, when we doe them good. If, I ſay, it be thus) then how groſſe an act is it both of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitablenes
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:153845:265"/> to them, and irreligion towards God, to viſit with trouble, to afflict and vexe the fatherleſſe and the widdow.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, From the matter about which they ſinned; <hi>The aſſe of the fatherleſſe, and the oxe, or cow of the widdow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>That the leſſe any thing is for or about which we ſinne, the greater is that ſinne.</q>
                  <p>It ſhews that we value God little, and that we ſet light by his commands, that we regard neyther his favour nor his anger, when we can doe evill upon ſuch poore accounts. That, by which many excuſe their ſinne, encreaſeth it. They will ſay, 'twas a ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a little thing they ſtole, or tooke away; but to ſin in a ſmall matter may be found a great ſin. What? will you breake through the holy commands of God, and venture his diſpleaſure for a trifle? though no man ſhould encourage himſelfe to ſin, becauſe he ſinneth for a matter of importance, yet there is not onely more folly, but more ſinfullneſſe in ſinning for a little. Woe to thoſe who ſin for the greateſt advantages, but more woe to thoſe who value their ſoules, and the lawes of God ſo little, as to diſobey the one, and endanger the other, when ſcarſe any thing which the world calls advantage is to be had. It hath been ſayd of old; <hi>If faith or an oath be to be broken, let it be broken for a kingdome;</hi> yet he will be found no gainer, who breakes his oath to get all the kingdomes of the world; what ſhall we ſay then of thoſe poore low ſpirited perſons, who ſinne (as we ſay) for ſix pence, and breake the lawes of God, for ſo poore a profit, as will hardly give them a breake-faſt. The ſinne of theſe oppreſſors is not yet full, ſee more and greater abominations then theſe.</p>

                  <p>The word which we tranſlate <hi>needy,</hi> ſignifies to <hi>deſire;</hi> they who have many wants have many deſires, and the ſenſe of our wants, is the ſpring of our deſires; And though many who have no want in outward things are full of deſires, yet the needy are properly the deſirers; and whoſoever deſires much, eyther hath many wants, or is not ſatisfied with his fullnes.</p>

                     <pb n="503" facs="tcp:153845:265"/>They turne the needy out of the way.</q>
                  <p>The Prophet (<hi>Amos,</hi> Chap. 2.7.) reproving the Princes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſayth, <hi>They turne aſide the way of the meek,</hi> or (as others render) <hi>of the poore and afflicted.</hi> That ſpeech of the Prophet ſeemes to be of neere allyance if not altogether the ſame in ſence with this of <hi>Job, They turne the needy out of the way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What way this ſhould be is expounded foure or five wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some take it metaphorically, for a morall way.<note place="margin">Divertere fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerunt impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes a via juſta. <hi>Sept:</hi>
                     </note> And that, firſt, the way of righteouſnes and equitie. And the wicked turne the needy out of that way, eyther, firſt, by their evill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, or ſecondly, by their threatenings and perſecutions. The ſinfull practices of men in power, lead the needy, or the inferior ſort into the practice of the ſame ſins. And the oppreſſions of the mighty doe even compel the needy to turne aſide from the right way of getting their livings,<note place="margin">Quaſi cogeren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur de via recta pietatis diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere ad furta &amp; perjuria, &amp; quaerimonias de divina provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentia.</note> to ſtealing and living by ſpoyle and rapine, as they themſelves doe. When rich men oppreſſe the poore, they turne the poore eyther to begging, or theeving. When men are vexed and moleſted in honeſt wayes, they lie under a great temptation to turne and betake themſelves to thoſe wayes which are diſhoneſt. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelfe being a perſecuter, that he compelled the profeſſors of the Goſpel <hi>to blaſpheme, (Act.</hi> 26.11.) and this he effected in one or both the wayes above ſpecified, eyther firſt, by his example, he being a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer (as he confeſſed, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.) they imitated him in blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheaming or ſpeaking evil of the wayes of God, and of his people: or, ſecondly, he did it by his cruelty, vexing them ſo in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſt, that ſome who were unſetled fell away, and blaſphemed the name of Chriſt, whom they had profeſſed. But though this be a truth, yet I ſhall not give it as the intent of this place. Therefore</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>They turne the needy out of the way;</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Dejecerunt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentes de via juſta. <hi>Ambr:</hi> Via pro jure &amp; juſtitia.</note> out of the way of that juſtice or right which is due to them. And ſo it ſuites well with what he ſayd before; <hi>they drive away the aſſe of the fatherleſſe,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>they turne the needy out of the way;</hi> that is, from what is his right, or from all meanes of recovering his right.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>They turne the needy out of the way;</hi> that is, out of the way of their livelihood; we commonly enquire, how doth
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:153845:266"/> ſuch a man live? and 'tis anſwered, he lives in a very good way, he hath ſuch a way of living, ſuch a trade, calling, or profeſſion; that's his way.<note place="margin">Via pauperum eſt facultus, ſibi neceſſaria pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundi. <hi>Aquin:</hi> Viam paupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ſubvertit tyrannus, cum illa detrahit ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne quibus ars cui vacatur pauper, exerce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri non poteſt.</note> Thus, to <hi>turne the needy out of the way,</hi> is to put them beſides the way of getting their bread, and maintaining their familyes with neceſſaryes for this life. In a figurative ſence, every mans profeſſion and calling is his way, and he that moleſts him in it, turnes him out of his way. As ſuppoſe a man live in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where he keepes a farme, if his cattle be taken away, he is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of his way, he can live no longer in that way. He that takes away what is inſtrumentall to a man in his calling, puts him out of his way; And he that diſturbes a man in the worke of his calling, turnes him out of his way. Our ordinary worke is our way, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.1.) <hi>Bleſſed is the man that hath not ſtood in the way of ſinners,</hi> that is, who hath not taken the courſe which (as ſuch) ſinners take. Now as a Godly man turnes out of, or will not ſtand in the way of ſinners; ſo oppreſſing ſinners turne many that are needy and Godly out of the way of their lawfull callings, and will not ſuffer them to ſtand or abide in them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may underſtand this way properly for the way or roade wherein men walke or travaile upon their occaſions, and then theſe words; <hi>They turne the needy out of the way,</hi> may be expounded, as an argument of the extreame pride of theſe <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rods,</hi> or <hi>ſonnes of violence.</hi> They cauſed the needy to turne aſide out of the way to give them place, or they made the poore to keepe out of their ſight for feare of them, leſt as they had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſpoyled them of their eſtates, ſo they ſhould alſo abuſe their perſons,<note place="margin">Illis graſſanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, nullis ne tenuis quidem ſortis, viatori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus tuta eſt via; adeo ut deflecte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re a via publica et latebras quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere paſſim co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantur. <hi>Bez:</hi>
                     </note> and make them ſlaves. Thus they turned the poore out of the way; that is, they durſt not come in ſight for feare; this ſuites well with the laſt clauſe of the verſe.</p>
                  <q>The poore of the earth hide themſelves together.</q>
                  <p>The word <hi>needy,</hi> in the former part of the verſe (as was toucht before) ſignifies one full of deſires; here the word which we render <hi>poore,</hi> notes one that is <hi>humble, meeke, lowly,</hi> not onely one low in eſtate, but lowly in minde, not onely him that is poore in purſe, but poore in ſpirit; ſo 'tis tranſlated, (<hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.3.) <hi>Seeke ye the Lord, ye meeke of the earth,</hi> even theſe <hi>poore of the earth hide themſelves together;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Inviſibiles fece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt.</hi> Author Cat:</note> wicked proud men make the poore ſeeke cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; the poore have often had experience of their cruelty, and
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:153845:266"/> rough dealing, and therefore run together into holes and corners to hide themſelves, as deſireing rather the ſociety of wild beaſts, then of ſuch beaſtly men. Further, the word which we render <hi>together,</hi> may be tranſlated, <hi>alike; They hide themſelves alike;</hi> that is, one poore godly man as well as another, they all fare alike, they deale no better with one then with another, none have hope to eſcape the hands of theſe unmercifull tyrants. Thus it was in the time of that great oppreſſion which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were under by the <hi>Philiſtims; The Iſraelites hid themſelves;</hi> When <hi>Jonathan</hi> and his Armour-bearer got up, and diſcovered themſelves to the Garriſon of the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> ſaid, <hi>Behold the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes come forth out of the holes where they had hid themſelves,</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.11.) The Author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> gives us a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the poore Saints thus hiding themſelves together, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.37.) <hi>They wandred about in ſheepe-skins, and goate-skins, being deſtitute, afflicted, and tormented, they wandred in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, and mountains, in dens, and caves of the earth. The poore and meeke of the earth hid themſelves together.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we have had a large enumeration of thoſe violences which <hi>Job</hi> had obſerved among men, and men proſpering in them. Firſt, violence upon lands; ſecondly, upon cattle; thirdly, upon perſons, the needy, and the poore are forced to run together into corners; <hi>While The ſin of ſome encreaſeth, the affliction of others muſt needes encreaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>Sinners know no bounds.</q>
                  <p>They who at firſt wrong men in their lands, will not ſticke to wrong them in their cattle, and within a while, they make no bones to fall upon their perſons.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note.</p>
                  <q>Thoſe evills which are done to men immediately in their perſons, are more ſinfull then thoſe that are done to them in their goods, cattle, and eſtate.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> ſhews the worſt of their doings laſt. 'Tis bad enough to touch the goods of a poore man, but to trouble his perſon, or cauſeleſſely to make him hide his head, is farre worſe.</p>
                  <pb n="506" facs="tcp:153845:267"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note.</p>
                  <q>That the promotion, and exaltation of wicked men, is the oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and vexation of poore men, eſpecially of all of poore godly men.</q>
                  <p>It is a ſad time with poore men, moſt of all with poore godly men, when the wicked are exalted. <hi>Solomon</hi> gives us this note in expreſſe termes (<hi>Prov.</hi> 28.28.) <hi>When the wicked riſe</hi> (that is, <hi>when they riſe in power and authority) men hide themſelves,</hi> that is, good men hide themſelves: poore men hide themſelves when the wicked riſe, but moſt of all ſuch poore men as are godly. <hi>The reigne of wicked men is the ruine of the godly.</hi> Which is more plaine by the oppoſition made in the laſt clauſe of the verſe; <hi>When the wicked riſe, men hide themſelves, but when they periſh the righteous increaſe.</hi> In which Proverb, <hi>riſing</hi> is oppoſed to <hi>periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> but <hi>men</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> are the ſame. When the wicked periſh, thoſe righteous men, who before hid themſelves, appeare, and ſhew themſelves againe. Some poore men are turbulent, proud, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable, ſeditious, men of unquiet ſpirits, if ſuch be dealt with by juſtice, and made to hide themſelves, they have their deſert. But the poore who are alſo humble, meeke, and of a quiet ſpirit, (as the word here imports) are the aime of the wicked. Such <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> found in his low eſtate, and againſt them he prayed (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.19, 20.) <hi>Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoyce over me: neyther let them winke with the eye</hi> (that is, let them not have occaſion to contemne and deſpiſe me, of which, winking with the eye was a token) <hi>that hate me without a cauſe. For they ſpeake not peace, but they deviſe deceitfull matters againſt them that are quiet in the land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly Note.</p>
                  <q>The poore goe by the worſt, and the weakeſt to the wall, the needy are turned out of the way, and the poore hide themſelves.</q>
                  <p>And therefore ſaith God (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.5.) <hi>For the oppreſſion of the poore, and for the ſighing of the needy, now will I ariſe and ſet him in ſafety from him that puffeth at him.</hi> Oppreſſion may quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly empoveriſh the rich, but uſually the poore fall under oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they that are full ſigh when they are made needy and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when all is taken from them, but uſually the needy and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:153845:267"/> are made to ſigh; <hi>for the oppreſſion of the poore, will I ariſe ſaith the Lord.</hi> Rich and great men can defend themſelves from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, but the poore have no ſhelter; rich men will purchaſe their right, but the poore who hath nothing to give, ſeldome finds a friend to deliver him, and get him his right. The ſtorme falls upon the poore, and moſt upon Gods poore, they are moſt ſubject, or lie moſt open to the evills of this world, of whom this preſent evill world is not worthy, and for whom the good of the next world is prepared. And therefore they ſhould fly to ſhelter, while they are here, get under covert, run into the name of God for ſafety and protection; they who are moſt ſubject to oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, need moſt protection. Some are ſo poore that they have nothing to looſe, and ſo needy, that they need not feare oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. They have neyther bread to eate, nor cloathes to put onne, Theſe are no baite for covetouſnes; But, they alſo are to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned among the poore, who have no more then will ſave them from poverty; and they are among the needy, who have onely ſo much as ſerves to ſupply their owne needs. Theſe poore and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ones are game for the oppreſſors, theſe the Wolves and Lyons of the earth make their prey. The oppreſſion and wickednes of theſe hath aſcended three ſteps, in the context now opened, They are firſt <hi>Land-invaders;</hi> ſecondly, <hi>Cattel-takers;</hi> thirdly, <hi>men-troublers. Job</hi> carrieth on the deſcription of their wickednes yet further, in the following parts of this Chapter.</p>

                  <p>I anſwer; Firſt, The Scripture ſpeaks of many wildeerneſſes that were planted &amp; inhabited. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt preached in the wildernes of <hi>Judea (Math.</hi> 3.1.) And the wildernes had many houſes if not townes in it, ſuch wilderneſſes yeeld food in plenty. Secondly, the wildernes may be ſayd to yeeld them food, not becauſe they did
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:153845:270"/> live upon that which grew in the wildernes, or in theſe waſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but becauſe in the wildernes they tooke occaſion to ſpoyle and robb thoſe that thorough it travailed to other places. Many get their livings there, where none live, and where nothing is to be had of the growth of the place to live upon. Outrages and robberyes are uſually committed in ſuch places. And therefore in the Propheſie of that great Peace which Chriſt ſhould give to his Church (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.3.) It is ſayd, <hi>The moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines ſhall bring peace to the people, and the little hills by righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes;</hi> He names the mountaines and the hills above other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, becauſe in or upon them violence is often exerciſed; and to ſay, <hi>the mountaines ſhall bring peace,</hi> is much more then to ſay the valleys and the Cities ſhall bring peace: when there is peace and ſafety upon hils and mountaines, we may preſume that there is peace every where. Therefore as when God promiſeth (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.17.) that in the latter dayes he will make the <hi>officers among his people peace, and their exactors righteouſneſſe,</hi> he meanes that he will make all ſorts of men peacefull and righteous, becauſe he will make them ſuch who are uſually moſt troubleſome and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>officers and exactors:</hi> ſo when he ſaith <hi>the mountaines ſhall bring peace,</hi> the meaning is, every place ſhall, or that the peace ſhall be univerſal in all places, becauſe mountaines and wilderneſſes are the places where robbers and ſpoylers take their prey, and get their ſubſiſtence. And hence it may well be anſwered, why <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, that <hi>the wildernes yeelded them food,</hi> even becauſe that place was fitteſt for them ſo rob and ſpoyle in, who made the ſpoyle of others their dayly food. Thus <hi>the wildernes yeelds food for them</hi>
                     <q>And for their Children.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word ſignifies any that are young, and is taken as well for <hi>ſervants</hi> as <hi>for Children</hi> (1 Sam. 21.5.) <hi>The veſſels of the young men are holy,</hi> ſayd <hi>David</hi> to the Prieſt concerning his followers. So (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.9.) Thus here it comprehends all that are about them, even all their family and retinue. They and all theirs, all that belong to them have their food in the wildernes, that is, there they take opportunity by violence and oppreſſion to maintaine themſelves and theirs.</p>
                  <p>Here we may conſider, firſt, that <hi>Job</hi> calls theſe ſpoylers <hi>wilde aſſes,</hi> nor doth the Scripture ſpeake this in vaine.</p>

                  <q>Wicked men are like Beaſts or beaſtiall in their diſpoſitions and actions.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> compares the beſt of that ſort, <hi>men in honour,</hi> to beaſts (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.20.) <hi>Man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that is in honour and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth not, is like the beaſts that periſh. Davids</hi> man that <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth not,</hi> is not a man without naturall, but a man without true ſpiritual capacity and underſtanding; A man who feares not God, (for <hi>to feare God that is wiſdome</hi>) and who departs not from evill, for <hi>to depart from evill that is underſtanding (Job</hi> 28.28.) Now how great and large an underſtanding ſo ever any great and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable man hath, yet if he hath not an underſtanding in theſe things, <hi>he is like the beaſts that periſh.</hi> It is not ſayd he is like this or that beaſt, but he is like <hi>the beaſts that periſh.</hi> Take any beaſt, or all beaſts, the worſt of beaſts, he is the picture of them all, and he dayly exemplyfyes the vileſt of their qualityes in his owne. The Prophet <hi>Michah</hi> (Chap. 3.1, 2, 3.) ſaith that of them, which ſpeakes them rather beaſts indeed then like beaſts, <hi>Heare I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye Princes of the houſe of Iſrael, is it not for you to know Judgement?</hi> (as if he had ſayd, who ſhould if not you) <hi>who hate the good, and love the evill, who plucke off their skin from off them, &amp; their fleſh from off their bones, who alſo eate the fleſh of my people, and flay off their skin, and break their bones,</hi> &amp;c. How could the beaſt be more lively acted then by theſe men? <hi>Paul</hi> fought with beaſts at <hi>Epheſus</hi> (1 Cor. 15.32.) which, I grant, may be expounded properly, and poſſibly beſt ſo, It being uſuall in thoſe times of perſecution under Heatheniſh power; to caſt the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to the wild beaſts, and for the common ſort to cry out, <hi>Away with the Chriſtians to the Lyons;</hi> yet it is as true that <hi>Paul</hi> did fight or contend with beaſts in the ſhape of men. And he ſpeakes particularly concerning bloody <hi>Nero,</hi> A man in the higheſt honour of that age. (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.17.) <hi>I was delivered out of the mouth of the Lyon.</hi> The Baptiſt called the Phariſees <hi>a generation of vipers, (Math.</hi> 3.7.) And <hi>Herod</hi> is called by Chriſt, <hi>that Fox,</hi> (Luk. 13.32.) And 'tis ſayd of all ungodly men at once (<hi>Rev.</hi> 22.15.) <hi>Without are Doggs.</hi> Wolves, Lyons, Foxes, Vipers, Serpents; Doggs, the worſt of Creatures for rapine and ſpoyle, doe but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the inhumanity and cruelty of wicked men. And becauſe
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:153845:271"/> they are compar'd to wild Aſſes in the text, I will give you ſome paralels between them and the wild Aſſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In their lawleſnes and unſubjection to command: car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men are lawles.<note place="margin">Libertatis ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolum eſt Ona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> The Apoſtle calls them ſo (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9.) <hi>Knowing this that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawles and diſobedient;</hi> not that they have no law, but they live as if they had none, they who love to diſobey the law are lawles, and embrace libertiniſme in ſtead of liberty. Thus the wicked man is as the <hi>wild aſſe,</hi> for his licentiouſnes and lawleſnes; for ſo the wild aſſe is deſcribed in the 39<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of this booke, verſe the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>; <hi>Who hath ſent out the wild aſſe free? or looſed the bands of the wild aſſe?</hi> what's the freedome of the wild aſſe? not like that of men who have the priviledge of freedome in an order, but to be free without order. The wicked would be where they will, and doe what they liſt, this is the freedome of the wild aſſe. Now as God himſelfe there puts the Queſtion, <hi>Who hath ſent out the wild aſſe free?</hi> who hath manu-mitted him? Surely no man hath done it, but God hath planted it in the nature of the wild aſſe to be free, and to live without bands or bounds. And if we ſhould ask the Queſtion, <hi>Who hath ſent out wicked men free? and who hath looſed the bands of the wicked?</hi> The anſwer muſt be, Satan hath done it, and their own evill hearts have done it: they have broke the bands, and caſt away all coards from them, they have ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves free, in ſuch a freedome as it is, which is indeed perfect thraldome to their owne luſts, and the lawes of the Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; they are not free by being deliverd from the bondage and condemnation of the law, but by caſting off all obedience and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Wild aſſes are extreamly violent and Impetuous in their deſires or luſts. <hi>Jeremy</hi> expoſtulating with the <hi>Jewes</hi> about their revolting from, and rebellion againſt God, compares them (<hi>Chap.</hi> 2.24.) to <hi>A wild aſſe uſed to the wildernes, that ſnuffeth up the winde at her pleaſure, in her occaſion who can turne her away? all they that ſeeke her, will not weary themſelves, in her moneth they ſhall finde her;</hi> there's no medling, no dealing with the wild aſſe while luſt is upon her, ſhe will have the deſire of her heart if ſhe can. Thus wicked men are given up to and tranſported with their pleaſures and inordinate affections, in their <hi>occaſion,</hi> that is, when the heate of their intemperate deſires or luſts, of any kinde, are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:153845:271"/> them, there is no turning of them; onely, <hi>in their moneth,</hi> when ſorrowes and paines are upon them, they may be ſpoken with. We may alſo read both this ſin and the reproofe of that people in a like alluſion (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.9.)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The wild aſſe is an Embleme of the wicked man, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as he is an oppreſſor or tyrant in his unſociablenes; for as the aſſe refuſeth ſociety, ſo theſe are unfit for ſociety, and are indeed enemies of mankinde; They are unfit not only for ſpirituall, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for Politicall, or Civill Society. God ſpeaking of the wild Aſſe (in the 39<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of this booke, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7.) ſayth, <hi>Whoſe houſe I have made the wildernes, and the barren land his dwellings. Hee ſcorneth the multitude of the Citie, neither regardeth hee the crying of the driver; the range of the mountaines is his paſture, and hee ſearcheth after every green thing.</hi> Though the oppreſſor live in the City, yet hee is like the wild aſſe in this, he cares not to maintaine ſociety as hee ought; hee cares for the ſociety of others onely for himſelfe, <hi>hee ſcorneth the multitude of the City,</hi> he is for the range of the mountaines, where he may take all he can get, <hi>he ſearcheth after every greene thing,</hi> whatſoever hath pleaſure or profit in it, he purſues it for himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>This paralel might be drawne out further; wild aſſes (as Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts have obſerved) are fearefull.<note place="margin">Belocitas timi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditalis ſubſidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</note> Thoſe Creatures that are moſt ſwift, are naturally moſt fearfull; and their ſwiftnes is a releefe to their fearfullnes. Thus, wicked men are fearfull. They onely have true Courage who feare God, and where the feare of God is not,<note place="margin">Timida eſt om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Nequitia.</note> every other feare is, or every other thing is feared. They who finde not a friend in their owne conſciences, are ready to ſuſpect every one for an enemy. So that though every wicked man would have all that he can get to himſelfe alone, yet he dares not be alone in getting it. And upon thoſe termes onely he is willing that others ſhould joyne with him in the profit, becauſe he would have them joyne with him in the ſin. (<hi>Pro.</hi> 1.11.14.) <hi>Come with us, let us lay wait for blood,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Caſt in thy lot with us, we will all have one purſe.</hi> Wicked men are not for ſociety, unleſſe it be in wickednes, and yet theirs is not ſo much a ſociety as a conſpiracy. A wicked man, let his ſin be what it will, is glad when he hath partners in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, or that others doe the ſame with him, not onely becauſe he hath a ſuſcipicion of the lawfullnes of what he doth, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſuſpects ſome ſuddaine danger in doing it. And hence
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:153845:272"/> ſome have noted that the woman, who committed the firſt ſinne, did not like to be alone in it, and therefore having eaten her ſelfe ſhee gave the fruit of the tree to her husband to eate alſo; ſhee deſiered an aſſociate both to countenance her in the act, and to helpe beare her out in the conſequents of it. And when they had both ſinned, they ſhewed themſelves like wild Aſſes indeed, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into the thickets at the approach of God, there to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves both for ſhame and feare. <hi>Behold as wild aſſes</hi>
                     <q>They goe forth to their worke.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>To wrong men, to ſin againſt God, is the worke of wicked men.</q>
                  <p>That's their buſienes. Therefore in Scripture they are often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>workers of Iniquity;</hi> Implying that to doe iniquitie is their trade of life, or that which they live by and dayly ſet themſelves about. The worke of God is none of their worke, nor doe they count it ſo, <hi>being</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16.) <hi>abominable, diſobedient, and unto every good worke reprobate.</hi> Good worke is put into the hand of man by the hand of God, but they have their worke from another hand, <hi>the luſts of your father yee will doe</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to the Phariſees, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44,) that is, ye will doe the devills worke; That's their worke, and they goe forth to it as the honeſt labouring man <hi>goeth forth unto his worke and to his labour untill the Evening, (Pſal.</hi> 104.23.) ſo the wicked man goeth forth to ſin as to his worke; And that he doth ſo is evident upon a foure-fold account.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe he doth not ſtumble upon it, but intends it; a godly man falls into ſin, but to ſin is not his intendment, a godly man may ſin when he goeth forth, but he doth not goe forth to ſin, he doth not make it his buiſines. That is properly a mans worke, which he propoſeth to himſelfe to doe, and purpoſeth to doe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He goeth forth to it as to his worke, for he delights in it; he is pleaſed with it. It is his meate and drinke, yea his mirth and muſicke to doe evill. That is properly a mans worke, which though it be painefull to him to doe it, yet he is pleaſed in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Hee goes forth to it as to his worke, for he ſpends
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:153845:272"/> his ſpirits, his ſtrength and time in it; wee doe many things which are not our worke, they are but by-works, or beſide our worke, wee beſtow little of our time and ſtrength in ſuch things: that which a man beſtowes his time and ſtrength upon, that whereat he labours to ſweat and wearines of body, that's his worke; now the time of wicked men runs out, and their ſtrength is conſumed in ſinning, and though they are not weary of committing iniquity, yet they weary themſelves (as the Prophet ſpeakes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.5.) to commit iniquitie, therefore that's their worke.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Wicked men are skillfull to ſin, they ſin with a kinde of art, therefore that's their worke; that which is a mans proper worke, hee hath knowledge about it, and is dextrous at; He doth not bungle, but makes cleane worke (as we ſay) of that which is <hi>his worke.</hi> A Miniſter ſhould preach the Goſpel like a workman that <hi>needs not be aſhamed</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes.) The wicked ſin like workmen, though the more they doe ſo, the more cauſe they have to be aſhamed. The Prophet (<hi>Jer.</hi> 9.5.) bewayling the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame ſinfullnes of thoſe times, ſaith, <hi>They have taught their tongues to ſpeake lies.</hi> As if they had ſtudyed the art and language of lying: while they told or made groſſe lies, they would not make them groſſely, but with a kinde of finenes and neatenes As though what a Godly man doth according to the minde of God, he doth by grace, yet he uſeth a kinde of artificialnes in doing it; and is therefore exhorted to walke circumſpectly or accurately; that is, to act all his duties with exactnes; ſo, though what an ungodly man doth againſt the minde of God, he doth it by nature, or very naturally, yet he uſeth a kind of artificiallnes in doing it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is ſayd (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.19, 20.) <hi>To give his mouth to evill, and to frame deceit with his tonuge, to ſit</hi> (as an artiſt at his worke) <hi>and ſpeake againſt his brother, and ſlaunder his owne mothers ſonne.</hi> Thus, <hi>they goe forth to their worke,</hi>
                     <q>Riſing betimes for a prey.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>A wicked man is very induſtrious and diligent in doing his worke.</q>
                  <p>To riſe betimes, and to doe a thing diligently, are the ſame in Scripture; ro riſe betimes is to riſe ſomewhat before the ordinary time of riſing; Now, when a man breaks his ſleepe to goe about
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:153845:273"/> his worke, this ſhews that he is induſtrious at it. As ſome wicked men quickly throw off their ſleepe, that they may doe miſchiefe: So (which argues the ſame principle and ſpirit) <hi>Others ſleepe not unleſſe they have done miſchiefe, and their ſleepe is taken away, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they cauſe ſome to fall.</hi> (Prov. 4.16.) Their owne ſleepe is taken away, unleſſe they take away ſomewhat which is not their owne. They will defraud themſelves of reſt, rather then not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud others of their right. They goe not more unwillingly to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon after they have done evill, then they goe to bed before they have done it. O how are they ſet upon miſchiefe, whoſe ſleepe departs from them unleſſe they doe it, and who cannot reſt unleſſe they trouble others. The ſervants of God, when they are up in zeale cannot ſleepe unleſſe they doe good; as <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.4, 5, 6.) <hi>Surely I will not come into the Tabernacle of my houſe, nor clime up to my bed; I will give no ſleepe to mine eyes, nor ſlumber to mine eyelids, till I have found a place for God,</hi> &amp;c. hee was ſo zealous for God that if he could he would not ſleepe, hee would forbid his owne reſt, though hee had never ſo much minde to it, till he had finiſht that worke for God. So ſayth the wicked man, I will give mine eyes no ſleepe nor ſlumber to mine eyelids till I have done this or that miſcheife, and brought my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to paſſe. When the wicked lye wakeing on their beds, what are they about then? their wakeing thoughts in the night are to doe miſchiefe in the morning. (<hi>Michah</hi> 2.1, 2.) <hi>Woe to them that deviſe Iniquity, and worke evill upon their beds.</hi> How doe they worke it upon their beds? they worke it in their thoughts, in their inward ſhop, there they faſhion it, and <hi>when the morning is light they practice it, becauſe it is in the power of their hand;</hi> they hinder themſelves from ſleepe, that they may forward themſelves in ſin; The night is ſpent in Imagineing, and plotting, and the day in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing what they have imagined and plotted. Their morning light is ſpent in the workes of darkenes, and the text ſayth, <hi>They practice it, becauſe it is in the power of their hand.</hi> They never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what is Juſt for them to doe, but what they have power to doe, if they have ability they want no will for the vileſt pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices.</p>
                  <p>Againe, as they cannot ſleepe ſometimes for deviſing evill, ſo when they have ſlept, their firſt waking thoughts are about evill; and this alſo is a further proofe of their extreame induſtriouſnes in
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:153845:273"/> doing evill. For as it is with a zealous Godly man, his firſt wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts are with God, and Chriſt, or about his owne ſoule, how God may be honoured, &amp; how his ſoule may be ſaved. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.18.) <hi>O how precious are thy thoughts</hi> (that is, thoughts of thee) <hi>to mee O God, how great is the ſumme of them! when I awake I am ſtill with thee:</hi> that is, <hi>my thoughts and meditations are with thee as ſoone as ever I awake;</hi> here's the diligence of the ſoule af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God: ſo the wicked man when he awakes hee is ſtill with ſin; And if hee cannot awake naturally ſoone enough to ſin, hee will force himſelfe to awake: And ſo he may be ſayd to awake to ſin, before he is awake; for as ſome nurſe up and feed their ſleepe when they are a little awakened, like the ſluggard, <hi>yet a little ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, yet a little ſleepe;</hi> ſo others offers violence to, or breake their ſleepe, that is, as the text ſayth, <hi>they riſe betimes,</hi> even before the uſuall time of riſing, that they may get a prey. It is no wonder, if they who ſticke not at breaking the lawes of God, breake alſo the lawes of their owne reſt.</p>
                  <p>Diligence is good about that which is good; it is good to be zealouſly affected alwayes in a good matter, but zeale and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence miſplaced, how evill are they! it is better to creep in a good way, then to run in a wrong way; Even idlenes is better then ſuch diligence; yet they who miſplace their zeale and diligence, are commonly more in both then they who place them right; and they who are in a falſe way, make more haſt then they who are in a true. The Scripture notes the extream Intenſenes of the builders of <hi>Babel</hi> upon their worke. And that's the ſtraine of moſt men in ſuch worke as theirs was, the building of a <hi>Babel,</hi> or in doing that, which will be but a monument of their owne pride and folly, or of their rebellion againſt and contempt of God. (<hi>Gen.</hi> 11.6.) <hi>This they begin to doe, and now nothing will be reſtrained from them which they have Imagined to doe;</hi> if they have but a minde to it they will doe it, let it coſt what it will, neyther difficulty nor dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhall reſtraine them. See alſo how Induſtrious the ten Tribes were in their Idolatrous worſhip which <hi>Jeroboam</hi> had ſet up, (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.30.) <hi>And this thing became a ſin; for the people went to worſhip before the one even unto Dan;</hi> that is, they went a great way to worſhip; for howſoever <hi>Jeroboam</hi> pretended the eaſe and accommodation of the people in ſetting up thoſe Calves (<hi>ver.</hi> 28.) <hi>It is too much for you to goe up to Jeruſalem; Behold thy
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:153845:274"/> Gods O Iſrael, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt</hi> (as if he had ſayd, thy Gods are at hand, or in thine eye, thou needeſt not toyle thy ſelfe in going ſo farre to ſerve them) yet <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was neerer unto moſt of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> then eyther <hi>Dan</hi> or <hi>Bethel</hi> were. For <hi>Bethel</hi> one of thoſe places of worſhip was in the utmoſt bounds of the South (<hi>Joſh.</hi> 18.22.) &amp; <hi>Dan</hi> the other place of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was in the utmoſt bounds of the North, (<hi>Joſh.</hi> 19.47) ſo that they were willing to take more paines to follow the Idolatrous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of man, then to keepe to the Inſtitutions of God. <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> was neerer to moſt of the ten Tribes then either <hi>Dan</hi> or <hi>Bethel;</hi> &amp; yet thither they would goe. All the way to ſin, whether in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary practice or worſhip is downe-hill to Nature, we have both the winde and tyde of the world with us, will we ſet our faces hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and to be ſure, Satan will never checke their diligence who are doing his worke, nor take them off from their pace, who are going or Galloping his way. We have a cleare evidence of this in the caſe of the worſhippers of thoſe two Calves in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel;</hi> and, it is further obſerved by ſome, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> grew ſo zealous in a ſhort time in that abomination, that they who dwelt neer <hi>Bethel</hi> did even diſdain to worſhip at <hi>Bethel,</hi> they diſdained to ſerve their God at their owne dores, and therefore they that dwelt at or neere <hi>Bethel</hi> would goe to <hi>Dan</hi> and worſhip; and they that dwelt at or neer <hi>Dan</hi> would goe to <hi>Bethel</hi> to worſhip. The heart of man is ſo mad upon Idolatry, that he is willing to be at any coſt or paines for it; He ſcornes to ſerve a falſe God at an eaſie rate, nor is he pleaſed (which is the onely thing which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſome who pretend to the true religion) with a cheape religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. You may lay what tax you will upon him, eyther of paynes or purſe, and he is willing, yea even ambitious to pay or performe it. Thus the blinde votaryes among the Papiſts at this day will needes goe a Pilgrimage to remoteſt places, they will travayle to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and viſit the Sepulchre, &amp;c. theſe long Journeyes they glory in, it is but a ſtep to them; hard penances, not onely faſtings but whippings they glory in. The nature of man will carry him two miles at his owne bidding, rather then one at Gods. How may it ſhame Godly men for their ſloath in doing the will of God, when they heare how induſtrious evill men are in doing their owne? how may it ſhame them, that they ſhould take leſſe paines to keepe a righteous law, then many doe to ſatisfie a filthy luſt?

The Lyon did teare in peices enough for his whelps, and ſtrugled for his Lyoneſſes.</hi> What did the Lyon? the Lyon did teare in peices! and how much did he teare in peices? not onely enough to fill his owne belly, but to feed his whelps, and his Lyoneſſes; <hi>Hee filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravine.</hi> Thus the Prophet deſcribeth wicked men, providing not onely for themſelves, but for theirs, their young Lyons and Lyoneſſes; <hi>The wildernes yeeldeth food for them and for their Children.</hi>

And (which they alſo did) to let them lodge without cloathing is worſt of all. <hi>To lodge without cloathing,</hi> notes their continuance in that diſtreſſed ſtate. The Prophet rebuking the <hi>Jewes</hi> for their vaine thoughts, puts them this queſtion; <hi>How long ſhall vaine thoughts lodge within thee?</hi> Why doe ye (as it were) make ready a roome, and a bed for them?

It is a great injury to take away a mans <hi>day-cloaths</hi> from his back, but to take away his <hi>night-cloaths</hi> from his bed, is yet more afflictive and injuririous. If a man have not cloathing for his body by day, yet if he have cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for his bed he may helpe himſelfe, but to cauſe the naked to lodge without cloathing, what Cruelty is this?

The Lord
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:153845:276"/> was very tender in this poynt, he would not have the poore lodge without cloathing; but ſome wicked men care not what the poore ſuffer, they neyther regard whether they have any lodging, nor whether they have any cloaths to lodge in. <hi>They cauſe the naked to lodge without Cloathing;</hi> ſo <hi>That</hi> (as it followeth in the text)

Therefore by the covering of the ſoule here, wee are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that which is to a man as his life, take away that and you take away his life. The ſoule is often put for the body, and then the Covering here meant is the Covering of the body, or that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering that is neereſt the ſoule, or neereſt life, ſo that, there is a great elegancy and emphaſis in it to ſay, <hi>They take away the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of their very ſoule;</hi> That is, they endanger their lives by it. Some tranſlate to that ſence, <hi>They take away the covering which is next their very skin,</hi> they would not leave them ſo much as a ſhirt, that's the Covering (in this ſence) of the ſoule. And when wee ſpeake of the utmoſt rigour and cruelty of man towards man, wee ſay (proverbially) He hath not left him ſo much as a ſhirt to his backe. Yet the Prophet expreſſeth the rigorous cruelty of man to man, by taking away that which may much more be called the covering of their ſoule (<hi>Mich:</hi> 3.3.) <hi>They eate the fleſh of my people, and flay their skin from off them.</hi> Skin and fleſh are indeed the Covering of the ſoule. To ſtrip the poore to their skin, is to take away the Covering of their ſoule; How much more to ſtrip

<q>They have no Covering in the cold.</q>

                  <p>This hath in it a double Inhumanity; Firſt, to expoſe them to extreame paine, and then to extreame ſhame. Not to have a covering is to be expoſed to ſhame, not to have a covering in the cold is to be expoſed to paine.

It is ſome helpe to a man, if he have no Cloaths to cover him, yet to have a houſe to cover him; but to have neyther body-cloaths, nor bed-cloaths, nor houſe, nor harbour, how ſad is this! And being thus helpleſſe, the next words ſhew us what a poore ſhift they made.</p>
                  <q>They embrace the rock for want of a ſhelter.</q>
                  <p>When he ſayth, <hi>They embrace the rock,</hi> his meaning is, they
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:153845:277"/> make much of it, they are glad of it, for ſo we are of thoſe things which we embrace; in ſtead of ſoft warme beds, they were glad of cold hard ſtones to ſecure and ſhelter them from the raine. Againe, <hi>They embrace the rock;</hi> that is, they goe into the holes and clefts of the rock, they had houſes (poſſibly) Pallaces before, but now they are forced to dwell in the holes of the rock.</p>
                  <p>In as much as <hi>Job</hi> ſayth, they did not onely goe to the rock for ſhelter, and make a ſhift with it, but embrace and hugg it, as being joyfull they had it.</p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>Great afflictions make ſmall comforts very welcome to us.</q>
                  <p>He that is turned out naked and hath no Cloaths to Cover him, would be glad to have a thatcht houſe, or the meaneſt Cottage to hide himſelfe in; hee that hath no houſe is glad if hee can have but the hole of a rock. (<hi>Lam.</hi> 4.5.) <hi>They who were brought up in ſcarlet embrace dunghills;</hi> hee doth not ſay, they are throwne upon dunghills, but they embrace them, they that were bred up in ſcarlet, are now glad of a dunghill to ſcape in, there to finde a mouldy cruſt to eate, there to pick up an old dirty ragge to cover their nakednes with, or old ſhoes to put upon their feete. So it was in the great famine and deſolation of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And ſo it was during the late warres in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the later, in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Some have fought and contended for a peece of Carrion, for a peece of a dead Horſe, nay for a peece of a dead man; that which ſtunck above ground, they contended for, and having wonne it, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced it and made dainty of it, as of the moſt pleaſant meate. Wee that are in our fullnes, and plenty, wee that have abundance, ſlight and make light of many good things; but we may ſoone be ſo ſtraitned and put to it, that we would be glad to embrace a rock, or a dunghill, that we would be glad of the crums that fall from our tables, and of the worſt ſcraps we leave upon our tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. Thus the old Saints are deſcribed (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.36.) glad they were of Caves and Dens, <hi>they wandred in deſerts, and in moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and in dens, and Caves of the earth, being deſtitute, afflicted, and tormented;</hi> they were glad to live among the wild beaſts, when they could not live quietly among men. When the winde and the Sunne beat upon the head of <hi>Jonah,</hi> the text ſaith, <hi>Jonah was glad of his gourd,</hi> a thing of little value, very meane, and fadeing in it
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:153845:278"/> ſelfe; yet when the Sunne ſhined hot, and the winde beat ſtrongly upon him, then hee was glad of a gourd. In times of plenty and peace, wre are ſcarſe thankfull for goodly houſes, for full tables, and rich Cloaths; But a little and that courſe food will cauſe the hungry to be thankfull. The naked will catch at old raggs, and they who have no houſe will embrace a rocke. There is a rocke, a myſticall rocke, whom the Saints embrace for a ſhelter, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in above all the goodly houſes in the world, yea above this whole world. Chriſt is a rocke to be embraced in our beſt dayes as our beſt ſhelter, and in our bad dayes he is our onely ſhelter. And while we are conſtrained by outward wants to embrace na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural rocks for the ſhelter of our bodyes, let us remember, how our inward and ſpirituall wants, doe alwayes conſtraine us to embrace that myſtical rocke, for the ſhelter of our ſoules.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>The Cruelty of man to man knowes no bounds.</q>
                  <p>Wee have ſeene in this context ſeveral ſteps of cruelty, men ravening for their prey like wild beaſts, men invading the harveſt and the vintage of their neighbours, men robbing both the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and the widdow, men pulling cloaths from the backes of the poore, and expoſing them naked to the cold, and to the raine, to the mercy of rocks and mountaines. Thus, man who ſhould be a God to man, kinde, mercifull, charitable, bountifull, courteous, proves himſelfe a Devill to man, churliſh, cruel, merciles, yea ſuch that even his tender mercies are cruell.

To uſe any violence to the fatherleſſe, though growne up, is (as hath been ſhewed) a great wickedneſſe, to uſe violence towards fatherleſſe infants is much more wicked, but to pull fatherleſſe infants from their mothers or nurſes breaſt (which is all the livelihood a childe hath) this is utmoſt wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.

                  <q>And take a pledge of the poore.</q>
                  <p>What a pledge is hath been opened (<hi>Chap.</hi> 22.6.) The words may alſo beare this tranſlation, <hi>They take that which is upon the
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:153845:279"/> poore for a pledge,</hi> namely, their rayment, not onely the cloaths which they have by them to ſpare, (a poore man may have a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle change) but the cloaths which they actually weare. How con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary this practiſe was to the Law, hath been ſhewed before, which forbad to take a pledge of ſuch things, as without which the poore cannot conveniently ſubſiſt.</p>
                  <p>There is a third reading, which ſayth not as we, <hi>they take a pledge of the poore,</hi> but, <hi>they take the poore for a pledge.</hi> Of which cruelty we read (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.1.) where the poore widdow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to the Prophet, that her husband being dead, the creditors were come, and <hi>had taken her two ſonnes to be bond men.</hi> Thus here when they had gotten their cattle (as was ſhewed before) and their cloaths from their backs, then they muſt have their bodyes too, to be ſlaves and drudges. Here firſt, I might note, That the ſinne of oppreſſion is aggravated in reference to the perſons upon whom it is exerciſed. But becauſe it hath been obſerved from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſages both of this and former Chapters, how ſinfull it is to oppreſſe thoſe, whom we are bound to releive, and to vexe thoſe, whom we ought to comfort; I ſhall not inſiſt upon it in this place. But</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, Secondly.</p>
                  <q>That covetouſneſſe knows no bounds.</q>
                  <p>As it hath been ſaid of envy, ſo we may ſay of covetouſneſſe, <hi>Covetouſneſſe, whether wilt thou?</hi> whether wilt thou lead, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hurry and force worldly men? covetouſneſſe carryes thoſe who are under the power of it no man knowes whether: who can tell where he ſhall ſtopp or ſtay when he is once under the power of the ſpirit of covetouſneſſe? ſuch will not ſpare eyther the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe, or the widdow, not the cloaths upon their backes, no nor their backes nor bodyes. If a covetous eye can but diſcerne any advantage to be made, it will have body and all. There is no ſinne ſo hainous, none ſo baſe, and ſordid, but covetouſneſſe may be both the mother, and nurſe of it. A covetous man will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare eyther for the cruelty of the ſinne, or for the ſordidneſſe of it; Covetouſneſſe is a ſordid luſt; Covetouſneſſe is earthy, and mudds our ſpirits in earthly things. When the ſpirit of a man is once embaſed by covetouſnes, he is ready to doe any baſe thing. There is nothing here below, lower then that Spirit. And hence
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:153845:280"/> the Apoſtle concludes (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10.) That <hi>the love of money</hi> (which is covetouſneſſe) <hi>is the roote of all evill,</hi> that is, any evill of ſinne may grow up from that roote; and therefore the Apoſtle adds in the ſame place, <hi>That, while ſome have coveted it, they have erred from the faith.</hi> Covetouſneſſe is the roote of hereſie, which we may thinke farre removed from it. But (ſaith he) ſuch have erred from the faith; which may be underſtood of erring from the faith, both in regard of practice, and of doctrine; They have both acted and beleeved againſt the rule of faith for filthy lucre; and ſo have peirced themſelves through with many ſorrowes. Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe runneth us into all evill, and provokes many to doe ſuch things as peirce themſelves through with many ſorrowes as well as others. Covetouſneſſe peirceth the poore and needy, the widdow and the fatherleſſe with many ſorrowes, nor doth it ſpare its own Maſter, or ſlave rather, but peirceth him likewiſe through with many more and much worſe ſorrowes.</p>

                     <q>Within their walls.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a twofold expoſition of theſe words, <hi>within their walls,</hi> that is, ſay ſome, <hi>within their owne walls;</hi> the poore make oile within their walls, and tread their owne wine-preſſes, yet they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thirſt; that is, the poore are ſo oppreſt by the rich, that all the wine, and oile they can make for themſelves, will not ſatisfie their ordinary thirſt or neceſſity, or when the poore have made wine and oyle within their owne walls they ſuffer thirſt, that is, the rich come, and take all from them. Thus we may enterpret it of the poore making wine, &amp; oile for themſelves; For in thoſe Countries where Vines and Olive-trees abound, the poore have their quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and portion of wine and oyle, as here they have of corne or any other commodity, which is of the growth of this Country.</p>
                  <p>But I rather expound the whole verſe of the poore making oile for, and treading the wine-preſſes of the rich. The poore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for the rich, making oile within <hi>their walls,</hi> or <hi>within their rankes,</hi> that is, among their Olive trees they grow in rankes, and tread their wine-preſſes, yet <hi>they ſuffer thirſt;</hi> that is, though they labour hard for them, yet they have nothing for their labour, they make oile but they have no oile to anoint themſelves, they make
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:153845:282"/> wine, but they have no wine to quench their thirſt; thoſe cruell men neyther gave them wine nor oyle (in ſpecie, or) in kinde; but uſed them as Poets feine of <hi>Tantalus,</hi> who was ſet in a river of water up to his chin, but could not reach it, ſo the rich Tanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd the poore, calling them to worke all day in their oyle fatts, and wine preſſes, and yet ſent them home hungry and thirſty; or they ſent them home without that which is virtually or amounts to wine and oyle, that is, their wages, or reward; they gave them not that which their ſervice deſerved. This is that ſpeciall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, which, I conceive, <hi>Job</hi> intended in this place, both to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and reprove, the unconſiderablenes and cruelty of the rich towards the poore labouring man.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>That to deteine the wages of the labouring man is a provoking oppreſſion.</q>
                  <p>When men carry ſheaves, and yet are hungry, when they make oile, and tread the wine-preſſe, and yet ſuffer thirſt, this is a cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinne. The Lord forbad this expreſſely (<hi>Deut.</hi> 24.14, 15.) <hi>Thou ſhalt not oppreſſe an hired ſervant, that is poore, and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of the ſtrangers which are in thy land, within thy gates, at his day, thou ſhalt give him his hire, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall the Sunne goe downe upon it, for he is poore, and ſetteth his heart upon it, leſt he cry againſt thee to the Lord, and it be ſinne unto thee.</hi> The Law alſo ſayth (<hi>Deut.</hi> 25.4.) <hi>Thou ſhalt not muzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corne.</hi> Which though the Apoſtle applyeth in two places (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.9. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.18.) to ſhew the equity of it, that they who labour in the word and doctrine, or preach the Goſpel (which is ſpirituall food, the food of ſoules) ſhould be comfortably ſupplyed with temporall food, the food of their bodyes (though, I ſay) the Apoſtle doth pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly apply it to this ſort of labourers, yet it is extendible to all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt labourers in what kinde or way ſoever; For if the mouth of the labouring oxe ſhould not be muzled, then much more the mouth of a labouring man ſhould not be muzled, that reaps the corne, and treadeth the wine-preſſe, that is, ſuch ſhould not be ſent away hungry and thirſty. The Prophet (<hi>Jer.</hi> 22.13.) thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders out a threatning againſt thoſe who deale thus with the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer; <hi>Woe to him that builds his houſe by unrighteouſneſſe, and
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:153845:282"/> his chambers by wrong, that uſeth his neighbours ſervice without wages, and giveth him not for his worke.</hi> As ſome unrighteous men build chambers and houſes with the gold and ſilver which they have wrongfully gotten from the rich, ſo ſome build their houſes by getting the labour and paines of the poore wrongfully from them, that is, by denying them the wages which is due for their worke; <hi>Woe to ſuch ſayth the Lord.</hi> And againe (<hi>James</hi> 5.4.) the Apoſtle chargeth this upon the rich, <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the hire of the labourers, that have reaped downe your fields, which is of you kept backe by fraud, cryeth and the cryes of them which have reaped are entred into the eares of the Lord of Sabaoth, or of the Lord of hoſts;</hi> As if he had ſayd, the Lord who hath all the Armies of heaven and earth in his power, even he hath taken notice how ye wrong the labourer, and he will put forth his power to avenge their quarrel; The Lord of hoſts is the poore labourers friend, and he will be his Avenger. It is a ſin crying for vengeance, that when a poore man hath ſweat out his ſtrength to doe ſervice to the rich, he ſhould not have his wages given him to renew his ſtrength, and revive his ſpirits for further labour. The Apoſtle (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.) gives a charge <hi>that they that will not labour ſhould not eate; we heare</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that there are ſome who walke among you diſorderly, working not at all, now then, they that are ſuch we command and exhort by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that with quietneſſe they worke and eate their owne bread;</hi> and (<hi>ver.</hi> 10.) <hi>If any will not worke, neither ſhould he eate.</hi> But as they that will not worke have no right to eate; what they eate, they ſteale: ſo they who worke ſhould eate, elſe they are deprived of their right. Woe be to thoſe who eate, and worke not in ſome kinde or other, and woe be to thoſe who doe not give them to eate who worke; who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel or but call the poore to treade their wine-preſſes, and then let them ſuffer hunger and thirſt.</p>
                  <p>This ſin is committed not onely by the totall denying of reward, and wages; that's the groſſeſt way of it; But,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, This ſin is committed, when the poore man receives not a reward proportionable to his labour, when he hath not what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers his worke, but his wages is ſo ſcanty, and ſhort, that he is not able to make a living of it for the comfortable (according to his degree) maintaining of his charge: many are apt in this caſe to oppreſſe the labourer while they pay him. They will give him
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:153845:283"/> ſomewhat, but it ſhall be ſo ſhort, and poore, that he is not able to ſubſiſt upon it. Hence that common ſpeech among us, <hi>that there is nothing cheape but poore mens labour;</hi> men care not ſo their worke be done, though the workman be undone. They care not though the ſweat of his brows will ſcarſe (as 'tis uſually phraſ'd) finde him water to waſh his hands.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This ſin is committed when the labourer is defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of that which hath been agreed for, when cavills are raiſed and ſo the hire detained. This the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> reproves, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 5.4.) ſpeaking of the labourers hire, which (ſaith he) <hi>is of you kept backe by fraud;</hi> they did not tell them plainely they ſhould have no wages, but they quarrelled with them about their worke; ye have not done your worke well, or not ſo ſoone as ye ſhould, and therefore they will not pay them, or they pay them to halves. Thus ſome by fraud and cavills detaine the labourers hire, as others doe it by open violence, or flat denyall.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This ſin is committed by delaying to pay the labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. We finde in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law (the equity whereof remaines to this day) that not onely the denying, or defrauding of the labourer concerning his hire, is charged as ſinfull, but the very delaying of it. Suppoſe you pay all, at laſt, yet if you cauſe the poore to waite long for what is their due, this will be reckoned an oppreſſion: therefore ſayth the Law (<hi>Deut.</hi> 24.14, 15.) <hi>Thou ſhalt not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe an hired ſervant that is poore,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Minus ſolvit, qui minus tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore ſolvit.</note> 
                     <hi>and needy, at his day thou ſhalt give him his hire,</hi> (Thou ſhalt not oppreſſe him ſo much as by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring it for a day) <hi>neither ſhall the Sunne goe downe upon it.</hi> Conſider how ſtrict the righteous Lord, and our great Maſter is in this poynt, That Maſters ſhould deale well with their ſervants, and day-labourers, The Sun muſt not goe downe upon it, Why, <hi>for he is poore, and ſets his heart upon it.</hi> Which is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood like that (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.10.) <hi>If riches increaſe, ſet not thy heart upon them,</hi> that is, doe not fix your affections upon your riches, thinke not your ſelves happy becauſe ye are rich: but when <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſayth, <hi>the poore labourer ſets his heart upon it,</hi> the meaning is this, the poore labourer having wrought hard all day, thinkes of his wife, and family, for whom he is to provide, and then remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that at the evening he ſhall have his wages. I (ſayth he) ſhall have ſomewhat at night, though I worke hard all day; therefore ſayth the Lord, <hi>give it him at his day, let not the Sunne goe downe
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:153845:283"/> upon it;</hi> he reckons to have it when he goeth home, therefore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint him not. <hi>It may be a dangerous thing to be a labourers purſe-bearer for a night, if he deſire to have his hire, and you able to pay it;</hi> to deteine his wages upon thoſe termes is ſinfull, for he hath ſet his heart upon it, and fully expects it; therefore diſappoynt him not, doe not make him aſhamed of his hopes. This is the ſinne which <hi>Job</hi> deſcribes here, the wicked take, yea ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act worke of the poore, and then take or deteine their wages alſo. They muſt <hi>make oyle for them, and tread their wine-preſſes, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thirſt.</hi> This ſin cryeth, and this oppreſſion makes the poore groane, as it follows in the next verſe.</p>

                  <p>That is, the wounded cry out; the ſoule is put for the perſon, or the man; or the ſoule of the wounded is ſayd to cry out, to ſhew the greatneſſe and dolefullneſſe of the cry.

                  <q>Oppreſſion is a crying ſinne, and makes the oppreſſed cry.</q>
                  <p>The blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> who was the firſt man that ever was out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly wounded, cryed when he was dead; how much more doe they cry whoſe blood is powring out, and themſelves under preſent feare of death. The ſoules under the Altar <hi>cryed how long Lord, how long,</hi> (Rev. 6.9.) Thoſe ſoules had ſuffered, and were paſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet they cryed out for vengeance upon their adverſaryes, how much more will their ſoules cry who are under ſufferings? The wounds of the wounded are as ſo many wide mouthes crying out to God, though their owne ſoules ſhould be ſilent and ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. I have upon other paſſages in this booke met with the ſinne of oppreſſion, and the cry of the poore upon it, therefore I ſhall not further ſtay here, but a while inſiſt upon the laſt clauſe of this context, which holds out the chiefe and moſt conſiderable matter of it. The oppreſſour doth all theſe wickedneſſes, but what doth God? Surely we might expect to heare of God in the next words, healing and helping the wounded who make this cry, and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hairy ſcalpe of thoſe who made them cry; had not God a fit occaſion put in his hand to ſhew himſelfe? firſt, for the releife of the oppreſſed; and, ſecondly, for the puniſhment of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſour. He that beholds ſuch actings as theſe, the fatherles pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the breaſts, the poore made ſlaves, the labourer denied his wages, the wounded crying, groaning, (he I ſay, that beholds all this) might ſay in his heart, ſurely now God will preſently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, and indeed God hath often appeared, when the wicked have been in the heate of ſuch actings, and the poore in the heate of ſuch ſufferings. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.5.) <hi>For the oppreſſion of the poore, for the ſighing of the needy, now I will ariſe ſaith the Lord, I will ſet him in ſafety from him that puffeth at him.</hi> Yet here we finde no ſuch thing, nothing like the Lords ariſing for the ſaving of the poore from oppreſſion, or for the breaking of oppreſſors. <hi>Job</hi> ſaw or had ſeene the poore oppreſſed, and the needy ſighing, but did not ſee God comming eyther with deliverance or revenge? for he adds, though all this be done,
<q>Yet God layeth not folly to them.</q>

                  <p>God who is wiſdome and juſtice it ſelfe, and is to himſelfe and all others, the rule of wiſdome and juſtice, can no more doe any thing unwiſely, or unjuſtly, then he can ceaſe to be wiſe or juſt; and he can no more ceaſe to be wiſe or juſt, then ceaſe to be, for his wiſdome is himſelfe, and his Juſtice is himſelfe. There needs no more to be ſayd, to acquit any action of weaknes or unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, then to ſay, God hath done it. <hi>For</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.25.) <hi>The fooliſhneſſe of God is wiſer then men, and the weakneſſe of God ſtronger then men;</hi> We may ſay alſo (and in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, we ſay no more then the Apoſtle ſayd before) that, <hi>The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of God, is juſter then men,</hi> that is, thoſe things which God ſeemes to doe unjuſtly and unrighteouſly: As when he ſuffers wicked men to devoure the man that is more righteous then they, this ſeemes to be an act of unrighteouſneſſe, yet this is juſter and more righteous, then the juſtice and righteouſneſſe of men. And if the very unrighteouſneſſe of God (that is, what appeares to man as unrighteouſneſſe) be righteous; Then how righteous is the righteouſneſſe of God? That I meane which appeares righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the eyes of all men. This reading and ſence of the words, is ſafe, and holds out an excellent poynt of truth.</p>
                  <q>That God doth nothing which is unſavory or unjuſt.</q>
                  <p>Yet our tranſlation is both profitable and clearly ſuitable to the context, and therefore I ſhall a little inſiſt upon that.</p>
                  <q>Yet God layeth not folly to them.</q>

                  <p>Firſt, God doth not preſently call evill men to an account, or charge their ſinne upon them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God doth not preſently puniſh evill men for their
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:153845:286"/> ſin. To lay folly to a man is not onely to call him to anſwer for what he hath done, but to puniſh him as having done fooliſhly. He looks for a ſentence next who hath already received his charge, and is not able to acquit himſelfe, and wipe it off.</p>

A ſtop in our way is to our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits like hard and unſavory meate to our ſtomackes, that which we cannot digeſt.

                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The wayes of unrighteouſneſſe are fooliſh, and unſavory wayes.</q>
                  <p>Whatſoever hath ſinne in it, wanteth ſalt in it; Chriſt ſayth to his Diſciples (<hi>Mark.</hi> 9.50.) <hi>Have ſalt in your ſelves, and have

Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is the wiſeſt and the moſt ſavory thing in the world, in the account both of God and good men. <hi>The wiſedome which is from above,</hi> (ſayth the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> Chap. 3.17.) <hi>is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, and eaſie to be entreated, full of mercy, and good fruits, without partiality</hi> (towards men) <hi>without hypocriſie</hi> (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God) But the wiſedome that is troubleſome and vexatious, rough and harſh to others, is earthly, ſenſuall, deviliſh indeed, down-right madnes, abſurdnes, folly. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayth, <hi>Oppreſſion makes a wiſe man mad;</hi> but it will appeare at laſt, <hi>that the wiſeſt oppreſſors have been mad,</hi> fooliſh, ſaltleſſe, and brainleſſe men. Such uſe to flatter themſelves, and are often much flattered by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in their projects, and policies, for the onely wiſe men in the world, but in the end they dye like fooles.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, Secondly.</p>
                  <q>God ſuffers oppreſſours to goe on long before he puniſheth them, and he ſuffers the oppreſſed to cry long before he releives them.</q>
                  <p>God is often pleaſed to winke, while the wicked ſin, and he as often ſeemes to be aſleepe while the righteous ſuffer. Hence that ſad complaint of the Church (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.23, 24.) <hi>Awake, why ſleepeſt thou, O Lord, ariſe, caſt us not off for ever; wherefore hideſt thou thy face, and forgetteſt our affliction and our oppreſſion.</hi> This alſo cauſed <hi>David</hi> to cry out (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 13.1.) <hi>How long wilt thou forget me O Lord, for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from mee? how long ſhall mine enemies be exalted over mee?</hi> What, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the oppreſſion of an enemy for ever! while God aſſures his people (in that parable of the importunate widdow, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Judge, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.) that he will deliver them, yet he more then intimates that it may be very long before he doth it, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7.) <hi>And the Lord ſayd, heare what the unjuſt Judge ſaith; and ſhall not God avenge his owne elect who cry to him night and day, though he beare long with them;</hi> that is, though he exerciſe much
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:153845:287"/> patience towards thoſe tyrants who oppreſſe his elect, yea and much patience alſo towards his elect, in regard of their doubts and deſpondencies of their feare and unbeleefe about his comming to avenge and helpe them againſt thoſe Tyrants.</p>
                  <p>Further, Folly imports not onely ſin, but the greatnes of ſin, ſo that when it is ſayd, <hi>God layeth not folly to them,</hi> the ſence (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this notion of the word <hi>folly</hi>) is, that, though they ſin greatly, yet God makes no great matter of it, or he doth not charge their ſin upon them, nor puniſh them for their ſin anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly or in proportion to the greatnes of it,<note place="margin">Non ponit ſtul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titiam. <hi>i. e</hi> non imputat hoc iis tanquam graude peccatum, hoc enim ſtultitia vocatur.</note> but paſſeth it by, as if it were onely ſome infirmitie or ſmall offence; <hi>he doth not lay folly to them,</hi> nor doth he let them feele what egregious fooles they have been. The word <hi>folly</hi> is uſed often in Scripture in this ſence, to note a notorious ſinne (<hi>Gen.</hi> 34.7.) when the ſonnes of <hi>Jacob</hi> came out of the feild and heard how their ſiſter had been dealt with, <hi>they were exceedingly grieved, and they were very wrath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had wrought folly in Iſrael in lying with Jacobs daughter;</hi> that is, becauſe he had committed a great wickednes in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> We have the ſame ſin ſo expreſt againe by folly (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.12.) <hi>And ſhe anſwered him, nay my brother, doe not force me, for no ſuch thing ought to be done in Iſrael, doe not thou this folly;</hi> As if ſhe had ſayd; This is a grievous ſin, therefore doe it not. And when the Lord would ſhew <hi>Jobs</hi> three friends, the Greatnes of their error and miſtake in their diſpute with <hi>Job,</hi> he calls it <hi>folly (Job</hi> 42.9.) <hi>My ſervant Job ſhall pray for you, for him will I accept; leſt I deale with you according to your folly, in that ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right like my ſervant Job.</hi> Thus we ſee that great ſins whether in practice or opinion come under this cenſure in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; onely we may note that the three texts mentioned expreſſe folly in another originall word then the preſent text doth. There is folly enough, great folly in every the leaſt ſin, but Great ſinnes deſerve more to beare the name of folly in their foreheads.</p>
                  <p>Taking folly under this peculiar conſideration;</p>
                  <p>We may obſerve.</p>
                  <q>That, as The Lord in this life doth not puniſh any, no not the worſt of ſinners, according to the juſt demerit and dimenſion of their ſinnes, ſo he puniſheth ſome, whoſe ſins are very great, but very little.</q>
                  <pb n="547" facs="tcp:153845:287"/>
                  <p>Though he layeth their ſinne to them, yet he doth not lay it to them in the folly of it, or as it is their folly. He doth onely touch them with his little finger, while it might be thought he would breake them with his iron rod. He doth but chaſtiſe them with whips, while their ſin calls for ſcorpions. The Time will come, when God will lay folly to every wicked man, and make their ſin appeare, in the puniſhment of it, what now it is in the nature of it, out of meaſure ſinfull. Every impenitent ſinner ſhall then finde that his ſin is folly, that is, that his ſin is very great.</p>
                  <p>Yet a late learned Expoſiter upon this Booke, conceaves, thar the ſence is abated and diminiſhed in the word <hi>folly,</hi> as if it were,<note place="margin">

                     </note> a terme of extenuation; <hi>God doth not lay folly,</hi> that is, <hi>the leaſt ſinne</hi> to them; he doth not ſo much as charge them to have done irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, vainely, childiſhly, or unhandſomely; he doth not onely not deale with them as if they had ſinned haynouſly, but he doth not deale with them as if they had done fooliſhly. But whether we take the word <hi>Folly,</hi> as implying the Greatnes or the littlenes of their ſinne; whether we expound it as a terme of diminution, or of aggravation, the ſence of the text is not altered: in which <hi>Job</hi> intends onely to ſhew that though men have done very wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, yet God doth not preſently render to them according to what they have done. This is true in the firſt ſence of the word, if God doe not lay folly to them, as it ſignifies a great ſin, and this is much more true, if God doe not lay folly to them in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſence, as it ſignifies a little ſin. And this ſence of this latter clauſe of the verſe correſponds fully, with the generall ſcope of the Chapter, and of the whole Booke. For <hi>Job</hi> argues with his friends thus; <hi>Ye charge me with folly and wickedneſſe, becauſe I ſuffer, yet God ſuffers the wicked and doth not charge them with folly.</hi>

                     <hi>JOb</hi> having given many particular Inſtances of the wicked practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of evill men, ſeemes in this 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe to give us a generall Character of them; <hi>They are of thoſe that rebell againſt the light;</hi> As if he had ſayd, <hi>Would you know what theſe men are who commit ſuch horrid wickedneſſes, who oppreſſe the poore, the fatherles, the widdow; who detaine the hire of the labourer, and ſend them away hungry and thirſty when they have done their worke? would you know what ſort or kinde of men theſe are?

                  <p>Yet others conceive, that in this 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, and ſo forward, <hi>Job</hi> is deſcribing another ſort of wicked perſons then thoſe former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned.

                        </gap> rebella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit defecit.</note>This word is often uſed in Scripture for rebellion againſt any lawfull authority or power ſet over others to rule and governe them, and that's the Importance of it here, <hi>they rebell:</hi> and from this word <hi>Nimrod</hi> had his name, who was the firſt noted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell that ever was in the world; <hi>Nimrod</hi> was a great Prince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, but he became ſo by rebellion againſt God. Here <hi>Job</hi> diſcovers <hi>Nimrods</hi> or rebells againſt the light. But what was the light, againſt which they rebelled?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Light</hi> may be conſidered two wayes; Either properly, or figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively; wee may underſtand the text of light in a proper ſence, and ſome inſiſt cheifly upon that. <hi>They rebell againſt the light;</hi> that is, againſt the very light of he Sunne, or the ordinary day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; as if he had ſaid, <hi>If it were in the power of theſe men they would even pull the Sunne out of the firmament of heaven, that they might ſin unſeen.</hi> I will not, as ſome Interpreters doe, fix the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition here, though I grant, this ſence may be taken in, wicked men love naturall darknes, and hate even naturall light, the light of the Sunne, becauſe it ſeldome ſerves but often hinders their occaſions.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Take light figuratively for the light of knowledge, ſo it is more true, that wicked men rebell againſt it: and that light in this notion ſhould be here meant, the words plainly imply; For though ſome wicked men would be willing to be ſhut of the day light, yet it is hard to ſay they rebell againſt it: and thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſages, <hi>not to know the wayes of it, and not to abide in the pathes of it,</hi> are not ſo proper and ſignificant to ſet forth their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and endeavour of avoyding naturall light. So that the light rebelled againſt is rather an Internall light, that light which ſhines into the ſoule, then that which ſhines to the eye; and There is a twofold internal light, againſt which wicked men may be ſayd to rebell.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The light of nature, or natural internal light; There is a light of nature, or as ſome call it, a light of the natural conſcience, which every man carryeth about him, concerning good and evill, or what is to be done, and what is to be left undone. The Apoſtle is direct for this (<hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14.) <hi>The Gentiles having not the Law, doe by nature the things contained in the Law, theſe having not the
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:153845:289"/> Law</hi> (that is, the law of God formally publiſhed to and preſſed upon them) <hi>are a law unto themſelves</hi> (that is, they have the law of nature in common principles and notions of righteouſneſſe in themſelves) <hi>and</hi> (therefore) <hi>ſhew the worke of the law written in their hearts.</hi> Againſt this internal light the wicked rebel.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a light of divine Revelation, which ſhines into the ſoule from the Scriptures, or written word of God. The word of God is ſo often called light in Scripture, that I need not give particular Inſtances. Divine truths inſpired and directed by the Spirit of God are there written as with the beames of the Sun. Yet the wicked man rebells, as againſt the light of nature, ſo againſt the light of Scripture, againſt the cleareſt and fulleſt diſcoveryes of the minde of God.</p>
                  <p>Further; Some by the light againſt which they rebelled, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand God himſelfe, <hi>who is light</hi> (as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> calls him, (1 <hi>Ep:</hi> 1.5.) <hi>and in him is no darknes at all.</hi> All that rebel againſt God, muſt needs rebel againſt light, ſeing God is light. And the very reaſon why the light of nature, and the light of Scripture are rebelled againſt, is, becauſe the former hath ſomewhat of God in it, and the latter much of God in it; For as God is light, ſo all light is of God. And that light which is of God muſt needs be rebelled againſt by wicked men, ſeing they moſt of all rebel againſt God, who is light and the fountaine of it; for as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> argues about love, 1 <hi>Ep:</hi> 5.1.) <hi>Every one</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that loveth him that begat, loveth him alſo that is begotten of him.</hi> So we may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue about hatred and the effect of it, rebellion; He that hateth and rebelleth againſt him that begetteth light (ſo God doth, whence alſo he is called the <hi>Father of lights,</hi> (Jam: 1.17.) he, I ſay, that rebelleth againſt him that begetteth light) hateth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belleth againſt that light, which is begotten of him. <hi>They are of thoſe that rebell againſt the light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Divine truth is as light.</q>
                  <p>As the Sunne gives light to the eye, or outward man, ſo the Spirit of truth gives light by the word to the inner man. When God ſends his word to a people, he ſends light to a people: Chriſt is light, and the word is light; Chriſt in perſon, is the light of the world; the word in doctrine, is the light of the world: The truth
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:153845:290"/> of Divine Revelation is many wayes anſwerable to the light.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Light is pure, and beautifull, and the light is ſo pure, that you cannot impure, or defile it; ſo is truth: Though many have attempted to corrupt the truth and word of God, and ſhall at laſt be dealt with and judged, as they who have corrupted it; yet the truth remaines incorruptible, and ever ſhall. The beauty of it fades not, nor is the purity of it ſtained, by all the filth of falſe doctrine which hath been caſt into the face of it, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world unto this day.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Light is pleaſant and delightfull; <hi>Light is ſweet</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccl. 11.7.) <hi>and a pleaſant thing it is for the eyes to behold the Sunne:</hi> So truth is ſweete, and it is a pleaſant thing to behold and receave the Sun-light of Divine Revelations, where truth is taken in, it doth even raviſh the ſoule and fill it with unſpeakeable delights. Truth is as ſutable and pleaſant to the underſtanding, as good is or can be to the will and affections. <hi>David</hi> found not onely delight, this or that ſingle delight, but all ſorts and degrees of delight in the Law of God; And therefore he ſpeakes plurally (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.92.) <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſſe my delights had been in thy law, I had periſhed in my trouble.</hi> And againe (<hi>ver.</hi> 143.) <hi>Trouble and anguiſh have taken hold of me; yet thy commandements are my delights.</hi> All his troubles were over-ballanced and conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his delights in the law, and all his delights and contentments were Center'd in the Law. That light was ſo much his delight, that it overcame all worldly darknes, and did even extinguiſh all his worldly lights.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Light hath heate in it, and light is accompanied with influences, or conveighes them with it. All living creatures here below are cheriſhed and refreſhed, yea and things without life, as Gemms and mineralls are concocted and refined with the warmth and vertue of it. And ſo hath truth; The light of the word car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth heat and Influences with it, to warme the heart and comfort it, to concoct the groſſenes of mans minde and ſublimate it into an heavenly purity. <hi>Did not our heart burne within us while he talked with us by the way? and while he opened to us the Scriptures,</hi> ſayd the Diſciples of Chriſts diſcourſe with them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.31.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Light diſcovers and makes manifeſt; ſo doth truth, (<hi>Joh</hi> 3.20, 21.) <hi>Every one that doth evill hateth the light, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cometh to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved,</hi> or (as we
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:153845:290"/> put in the Margin) <hi>diſcovered. Light makes manifeſt; the word of God</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12.) <hi>is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart,</hi> it diſcovers that to us, not onely in others but in our ſelves, which wee ſaw not before; wee are much, if not altogether, unknowne to our ſelves, till we ſee our ſelves in the Glaſſe of the Word.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The light of truth is Clothed with Authority, the truths of God have a Soveraignety over man.</q>
                  <p>Wee cannot be ſaid to rebell againſt any thing but that which hath power and authority over us; a man may oppoſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with his equall, but hee cannot be ſaid to rebell againſt his equall; wee rebell onely againſt thoſe that are above us. If a childe oppoſeth his father, it is rebellion; if a ſervant oppoſeth his Maſter, it is rebellion, becauſe fathers and maſters have authority over their children and ſervants. All rebellion is the breaking of the bands of ſubjection. And all the bands of ſubjection are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken when the light is rebelled againſt, becauſe the light of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly truth, is inveſted with all power and authority over us; it hath a power to lift up and a power to humble or caſt downe; It hath a power to convince, and a power to comfort; It hath a power to kill, and it hath a power to make alive; all theſe powers the light of the word hath. But it hath two powers more eſpecially and eminently.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It hath the power of a rule, or power to rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne both the hearts and lives of men; the light of the word doth not onely offer advice, and give Councell, but it gives out a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, what the word ſpeaketh we are not upon poynt of Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencies whether we Will receive it or no, but upon poynt of duty. Therefore not to receive it, eſpecially to reſiſt it is rebellion; the light of the word is as a King, and where the light of that word comes, there is power, and no man may ſay, <hi>What doth it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, It hath the power of a Judge; It gives both Law and Judgement. <hi>He that rejecteth me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Joh,</hi> 12.48.) <hi>and receaveth not my words</hi> (The not receiving of the word of Chriſt, is the rejecting of Chriſt himſelfe, and he that rejecteth Chriſt) <hi>hath one that Judgeth him, the word that I have ſpoken, the ſame ſhall Judge him in the laſt day.</hi> The word is now the rule of
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:153845:291"/> living, and it ſhall be hereafter the rule of Judging; Now it is the rule by which we muſt live to Chriſt, and then it ſhall be the rule by which Chriſt will Judge us.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Where it is ſayd, <hi>They are of thoſe who rebell againſt the light;</hi> Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>Wicked men cannot abide to be ſeene in what they doe, nor doe they love to ſee what they doe.</q>
                  <p>They would neyther ſee their wicked practices, nor be ſeene in them. They are darknes, and they walke in darknes. As they walke in the darknes of ſin, ſo they would walke in the darknes of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, that others ſhould not ſee what evill they doe, and in the darknes of ignorance, that they might not ſee that what they doe is evill. They are like thoſe uncouth Creatures, Batts, and Owles, that come abroad onely in the night, knowing that if they doe but ſtirre out in the day, all the birds in the ayre will gather about them, and hoote at them, becauſe of their ſtrangenes and deformity. And doubtleſſe if wicked men did but ſee the miſhapen and ugly viſage of their owne wayes in the light of the word, they would abhorre and run from themſelves as the moſt abhorred monſters in the world, and ſo would all men (who ſee the uglynes of ſin in the glaſſe of the word) abhorre them and poynt at them as monſters, did they but ſee them in their ſinfull workes. And hence the Apoſtle (hinting the general diſpoſition of ſinners) ſaith (1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.7.) <hi>They that are drunken are drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the night.</hi> And againe (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.12.) <hi>For it is a ſhame even to ſpeake of thoſe things which are done of them in ſecret,</hi> that is, when they are out of the ſight of men, and, poſſibly, had it not been that they were out of ſight, or in ſecret, themſelves would not have done thoſe things for ſhame; For though ſome wicked men, as they have caſt off their honeſty, ſo their modeſty too, and act not onely wickedly, but impudently, <hi>the ſhew of their faces teſtifying againſt them, they declaring their ſin as Sodom;</hi> yet as the moſt of ſinners preſume God doth not ſee them when they doe evill, ſo they are unwilling that men ſhould; for though their Conſcience puts no barre to their ſinning openly, yet their credit doth. So that as every wicked man would be glad he did not know that what he doth is evill, and doth what he can to hinder or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the light of that knowledge in him, ſo moſt wicked men
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:153845:291"/> would be glad that no man knew of the evill which they doe, and they doe what they can to hinder others from knowing it; as hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites love to be ſeen in all the good they doe, and would doe no good, were it not (as Chriſt aſſures us, <hi>Math.</hi> 6.5.) <hi>to be ſeene of men;</hi> They faſt, and pray, and give Almes, and all to be ſeene of men, that is, that men may applaud them, and poynt at them with a Behold (of admiration) There goe the men, The charitable men, The humble men, The devout men; and if men ſee them not, or applaud them not, they are as in the ſhadow of death, they are dead-hearted to every good word and worke. Now (I ſay) as all groſſe hypocrites love the light, or to be ſeene while they are doing good, ſo the moſt prophane and wicked uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally avoyd the light, and love not to be ſeene when they are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evill. For though they are not troubled at the diſhonour they doe to God by ſinning, yet to be diſhonoured among men is a trouble to them. They can eaſily venture their ſoules as to the life to come, but they are afraid to doe wickedly in the ſight of men, leſt they endanger their eaſe and ſafety in this preſent life. That God ſeeth them not is their hope, that men may not ſee them is their care, and that they may not ſee themſelves is their deſire. They are unwilling to know their duty, leſt their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences ſhould check them for not doing, or for doing that which is not their duty. Thus in every ſence, <hi>They are of thoſe who rebell againſt the light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, As rebelling againſt the light, is an argument (as hath been ſhewed) that wicked men deſire not to know what they ought to doe, ſo it teacheth us Further,
<q>That wicked men will doe againſt that which they know.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men will have fellowſhip with the workes of darknes, while their eyes are dazzled with light, if their hearts have not been changed by it. They would be glad if they might never be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the light, but ſuppoſe the light doe come (as many times it doth come whether they will or no) ſuppoſe the light darted upon them ſo clearely and convincingly, that they cannot but ſee and know what they ought, and what they ought not to doe, yet they rebell againſt it; eyther they will not doe what they know, or they will doe contrary to their knowledge. When ſome of the Phariſees were offended at thoſe words (<hi>Joh.</hi> 9.39.) <hi>For
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:153845:292"/> Judgement am I come into this world, that they which ſee not might ſee, and that they which ſee might be made blinde:</hi> What, ſay they, <hi>are we alſo blind? Jeſus ſaid unto them, if ye were blind ye ſhould have no ſin, but now ye ſay we ſee, therefore your ſin remaineth;</hi> that is, it remaineth in the guilt and aggravations of it. For as they eonfeſſed that they ſaw, ſo Chriſt would convince them that they acted againſt what they ſaw, or that though they had the light, and ſo knew their duty, yet they had done contrary to duty. Man breakes through all the light that ſtands in his way, he breakes through the light both of nature and Conſcience, both of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Scripture, till himſelfe be made light. The Apoſtle demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates the former in the example of the old Gentiles, who though they were under a conviction of the power and preſence of God by the workes of Creation, and ſo were ſayd to know God, yet <hi>they did not like to retaine God in their knowledge, nor did they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him as God,</hi> (ver. 21.28.) but rebelled againſt that light which ſhone into their underſtandings from the creature. And in the ſecond Chapter of the ſame Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> the Apoſtle demonſtrates the latter in the example of the old <hi>Jewes,</hi> who though they were under a conviction not onely of the power and and preſence of God, but of the minde and will of God alſo, by a divine Revelation, or by the light of the word, yet they rebelled againſt that word which they boaſted of; and while they judged themſelves onely in the light, and all the reſt of the world in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, they walked in darknes. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18.) <hi>thou art called a Jew, and reſteſt in the law, and makeſt thy boaſt of God, and knoweſt his will,</hi> &amp;c. But how did the <hi>Jew</hi> anſwer this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and this boaſt, read that (<hi>v.</hi> 21, 22, 23, 24.) <hi>Thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which teacheſt another, teacheſt thou not thy ſelfe? Thou that preacheſt a man ſhould not ſteale, doeſt thou ſteale: Thou who makeſt thy boaſt of the law through breaking the law diſhonoureſt thou God? for the name of God is blaſphemed among the Gentiles through you.</hi> So that wicked men doe not onely rebell againſt the light to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the coming of it, or to keepe it off as long as they can, that ſo they may not know what to doe, but they rebell againſt it when it is come, and will doe againſt what they know.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, When 'tis ſayd, <hi>They rebell againſt the light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="557" facs="tcp:153845:292"/>Wicked men are not onely no friends but profeſſed reſolved enemies of the light, they hate and oppoſe holy truths, or the diſcoveries of the minde and will of Chriſt.</q>
                  <p>They are in open actuall hoſtility, they take up armes and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a warre againſt it; not that all wicked men doe expreſſely ſend forth their defiance againſt God and his word, but all wicked men carry this defiance in their hearts, and it is to God as an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly profeſt defiance, though it be not ſo to man; God heares the language of their hearts, and he knowes that <hi>the wiſdome</hi> (or beſt) <hi>of the fleſh is Enmity againſt himſelfe, that it is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be</hi> (Rom. 8.7.) That is, while a man continues (as to his ſpirituall ſtate) under the power &amp; teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the wiſdome of the fleſh, and is unregenerate, as he is not ſo it is impoſſible he ſhould (continuing in that ſtate) be ſubject to the law of God. The law of God will ever continue as holy as it is, and if the heart of man continue as unholy as it is, how ſhall they agree? A wicked man ſtands not upon termes of neutrality with the law and light of God, but he is a direct oppoſite or ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, he rebells againſt the light.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Seeing <hi>Job</hi> when he had deſcribed all thoſe wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes which he ſaw done, adds this deſcription of the wicked who did them, <hi>they are of thoſe that rebell againſt the light.</hi> This may be Conſidered two wayes (as I intimated before) firſt, as the diſcovery of a new and a greater ſin then any of thoſe particular ſins already inſtanced in; or as a reaſon why they did breake out into thoſe enormous ſins; the former conſideration yeelds this Note.</p>
                  <q>To reſiſt or rebell againſt the light of truth the word of God, is wickednes in perfection, or wickednes wrought and boyld up to the very height.</q>
                  <p>As God ſometimes brings Judgements upon men in perfection, ſo men ſin againſt God ſometimes in perfection. And if any doe ſo, ſurely they doe ſo, who rebell againſt the light: That ſpeciall ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, of which Chriſt ſayth, <hi>It ſhall never be forgiven;</hi> what is it? but rebellion againſt the light, the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and cleareſt light? and the more cleare and high the light is, the more danger there is of falling into that ſin. And hence ſome
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:153845:293"/> conceive that before Chriſt came in the fleſh, though there were very high and preſumptuous ſins committed, that yet none of them did amount to that which the Goſpel calls, <hi>The ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> There was Goſpel-light in thoſe times, but it was under types and ſhaddowes, there was not that cleare light, that cleareſt light which was ſhed abroad at the coming of Chriſt, and therefore there was not light enough to ſin againſt, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of that ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, which is not onely the greateſt rebellion againſt light, but is alſo a rebellion againſt the greateſt light. And here conſider by what degrees, ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt light riſeth unto its full height of rebellion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is very ſinfull and extreamely dangerous, not to love the light. See how Chriſt thunders againſt ſuch as doe not (<hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19.) <hi>This is the condemnation that light is come into the world, and men loved darknes rather then light:</hi> He doth not ſay, men rebelled againſt the light, he onely charges them with this crime, that they did not love it, but loved darknes rather. <hi>This,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is the Condemnation;</hi> that is, this will certainly be matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation againſt ſinners, that when light came to them, their hearts did not cloſe with it, and embrace it. Now if it be ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full not to love the light, what is it to rebell againſt it? It is very poſſible for a man not to love that thing or perſon againſt which yet he doth not rebel.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Not to obey, not to ſubmit to the light, is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſinfull. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt ſhall at laſt be revealed from heaven (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally) in flaming fire to take vengeance on them, that obey him not as revealed (doctrinally)</hi> that is, <hi>who obey not the Goſpel</hi> (2 Theſ. 1.7, 8.) yet it is poſſible not to obey the Goſpel, that is, to forbeare an active obedience to that which is Commanded in it, and not to rebell againſt it actively, theſe are diſtinct in themſelves, though ſeldome, if at all, diſtinct in thoſe that doe them. Now then if there be aboundance of wickednes in not obeying the light, in not doing every thing that the light directs us to; then it muſt needs be a more abounding wickednes, when the heart riſes up and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells againſt it. For though (as was even now intimated) we can hardly divide theſe in their exiſtences, yet we may diſtinguiſh them in their natures, or at leaſt in their degrees; for barely not to obey the light in doing the will of God, is a ſin of a lower ſtature, then a profeſt rebelling againſt it; though in every not doing accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:153845:293"/> to light, there is ſomewhat of rebelling, yet in that which is properly rebelling, there is more then not doing.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is a great ſin not to ſet a great price upon the light, or not to value it according to its worth; that is, not to value it highly, not to have a high eſteem of it, not to have a higher eſteem of it then of all the Enjoyments and Comforts of this world, is a high provocation. What is it then to rebell againſt it? it is ſinfull not to let all goe, not to ſuffer the loſs of all for the light, not to ſuffer even the loſs of life it ſelfe for the light, this is extreamly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Therefore ſaith Chriſt (<hi>Luk.</hi> 14.26.) <hi>He that will be my Diſciple muſt forſake father and mother,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yea and his life too;</hi> that is, hee muſt be ready to let all theſe goe if called to it, rather then let goe the light or truth of the Goſpel. Now if it be ſo great a ſin not to be willing to ſuffer any loſſe, or to endure any tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſtanding up for the light; what is it for any ſoule to riſe up againſt the light, or knowingly to withſtand it?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Apoſtle ſaith, that our neglect of the light of the Goſpel ſubjects us to outer darknes (<hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3.) <hi>How ſhall we Eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſalvation, which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſayd, the wiſeſt man in the whole world, cannot tell how a man ſhould eſcape eternal darknes or damnation (there is no poſſible way, no doore of hope to eſcape by) if he neglect that great ſalvation. But what's neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect? it is a light paſſing by of a thing, when offered; non-accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, is a neglect. Suppoſe you doe no more, when light is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd to you, but onely paſſe it by, becauſe you have no minde to it, you are not taken with the beauty and worth of it; If you doe nothing againſt it, onely you doe not embrace it, you cannot eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape. And when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>you cannot eſcape,</hi> without ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from what; you may ſay the worſt you can or can imagine, and that's it which he meanes you cannot eſcape, even the wrath of God and death eternal. Now if but to neglect ſalvation or the light, which is indeed, onely not to elect it, or not to make it our choice, be ſo damnable a ſin, what is it to rebell againſt the light? to doe which is the worſt that we can doe, even the perfection of wickednes. Surely they who thus rebel againſt the light, <hi>ſhall</hi> (as the Pſalmiſt ſpeakes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.19.) <hi>Goe to the generation of their fathers, where they ſhall never ſee light.</hi> They who rebel againſt the light of knowledge, ſhall not enjoy the light of comfort. As
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:153845:294"/> they have deſiered the abſence of the former light, ſo they ſhall be puniſhed with the abſence of the latter.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, As in theſe words <hi>Job</hi> ſhewes who they were that act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe groſſe wickedneſſes, even they who rebelled againſt the light; We may obſerve.</p>
                  <q>They who rebell againſt the light, will cloſe with, and embrace any ſin whatſoever; <hi>or,</hi> They who are all for darknes, are for any wickednes.</q>
                  <p>They who rebell againſt this beautifull thing <hi>light,</hi> are forward to embrace the fouleſt monſter; Thoſe things which 'tis a ſhame to ſpeake of, or ſo much as to name, theſe rebels againſt light are ready to doe. The Pſalmiſt moves God in prayer to looke to his Covenant by this argument (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.20.) <hi>For the darke places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty;</hi> that is, of cruel men, or of men ſo full of cruelty, that they deſerve rather to be called <hi>cruelty,</hi> then cruel, this ſort of men inhabit and fill up all thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where the light of holy truth doth not ſhine. Now if they who want the light, or have no true knowledge of God among them, are hereby (as it were) prepared for and put onne to the acting of all manner of wickednes, how much more are they prepared for the acting of any wickednes who have thruſt the light from them, and are in darke places of their owne making. The Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſhewes (<hi>Chap.</hi> 4.1.) that where there is no knowledge of God in a land (for want of meanes) there is no truth nor mercy, (that is, there is none exerciſed) in that land, but oppreſſion, deceit, and falſehood, beare downe all; how much more muſt it be ſo where there is no knowledge of God in a land, becauſe of the contempt of meanes, and rebellion againſt the light. What wickednes will not they doe in the darke, who put out the Candle that they may not ſee what they doe? <hi>Theſe are they who rebell againſt the light,</hi> and as it followeth,
<q>They know not the way thereof, nor abide in the pathes thereof.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe latter words are an illuſtration of the former.</p>
                  <q>They know not the wayes thereof.</q>
                  <p>This not knowing may be taken either for a ſimple igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, when we know not, eyther becauſe we have not an ability
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:153845:294"/> to know, or becauſe we have wanted all opportunities and helpes to get knowledge; or, ſecondly, not knowing may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of a willfull affected ignorance; <hi>they know not,</hi> that is, they deſire not to know: and ſo I conceive the meaning of <hi>they know not,</hi> is not that they were ſimply ignorant, or invincibly ignorant, as they are who ſit in a land of darknes, and in the valley of the ſhadow of death, but that theſe rejected the land of light, and ſo were under an affected ignorance; They knew not the truth, becauſe they would not.</p>
                  <p>Againe, We may be ſayd not to know that,<note place="margin">Non noſſe vias lucis eſt non a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere ea quae in luce agi ſolent. Illud neſcire di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimur quod non probamus.</note> which we doe not delight in, approve and practice. We know no more to purpoſe, then we preſently doe, or have a purpoſe to doe when the ſeaſon or opportunity calls us to it. How much light ſoever a wicked man hath, yet <hi>he knowes not the wayes of light,</hi> becauſe he doth not rejoyce or delight in the wayes of light, as alſo becauſe he doth not ſo much as approve the wayes of light; and if he neyther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in nor approve of thoſe wayes, no mervaile if he walke not in thoſe wayes, <hi>nor</hi> (as 'tis in the laſt clauſe of the verſe) <hi>abide in the pathes thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As if he had ſayd; Suppoſe they come ſometimes into the wayes of light and truth, ſuppoſe they ſometimes doe that which the light directs them to, yet they abide not in it. This is a further Character of the diſpoſition and temper of wicked men, who though poſſibly for a fit, or for a turne or two they walke in the wayes of light, yet they <hi>abide not in the pathes thereof.</hi> And this latter peice of their ſinfullnes ariſeth from the former; why doe they not <hi>abide in the pathes of light?</hi> even becauſe they <hi>know not the wayes thereof;</hi> that is, becauſe they doe not approve or delight in the wayes thereof. Whence note.</p>
                  <q>Wee cannot be conſtant in that which wee doe not affect.</q>
                  <p>If a man doth not know, that is, love and affect the wayes of light, he will never abide in the pathes of light; what wee love, with that we cloſe, what wee affect, in that we ſtick. The reaſon why the wicked abide in the pathes of ſin, is becauſe they love and delight in them. All the pathes of wickednes, are pathes of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſſe to the wicked, and therefore they abide in them. No man would be at all, much leſſe would he be long in a way that he doth not like. And that's the reaſon why wicked men if ever they doe
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:153845:295"/> this or that particular act of righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, yet they cannot perſevere in ſuch actings. A wicked man doth Good as a godly man doth evill, upon a temptation, not upon approbation; ſome carnal ayme or intereſt of profit or credit tempts him to doe good, but he doth not approve the good which he doth. And hence it is that as a good man abides not in the pathes of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ſo a wicked man abides not in the pathes of light. True holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes doth not begin at action, but at affection. They begin at the wrong end with Religion, who begin with doing rather then with liking. Many doe this, and they doe that, whereas they ſhould ſtrive to approve, and pray for a love to the truths and wayes of God which they practice; for want of this they often apoſtati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e and fall back, even from the practice of them. No bonds can hold us alwayes to the duties of obedience, but thoſe of love to God, and to the things wherein duty calls us to obey. And as want of this love is the reaſon why man is ſo apt to backſlide, and is (ſo far as a Negative may be) the very ſeed and principle of backſliding, ſo it is the reaſon why God gives ſuch up to the power and ſpirit of backſliding. (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10, 11.) <hi>Becauſe they received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved, for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould beleeve a lie.</hi> What is not begun in our affections, will not abide long in our actions.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>Not to abide in the pathes of truth and holines, is the marke of an ungodly man.</q>
                  <p>They who are not what they appeare in goodneſſe, will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſo much as appear good. They that are (as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſpake of his eldeſt Son <hi>Reuben</hi> (Gen. 49.4.) <hi>unſtable as water,</hi> ſhall not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, nor are they to be numbred among <hi>the excellent ones.</hi> The Apoſtle exhorts Saints (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58.) <hi>To be ſtedfaſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, alwayes abounding in the worke of the Lord.</hi> Saints move in the worke of the Lord, but they muſt not move out of the worke of the Lord, <hi>Bee ye ſtedfaſt and unmoveable;</hi> but in what? in the worke of the Lord; That is the ſphere in which Saints move, the ſphere of their activity and uſe; and out of that they dare not move. The Sun in the firmament is moving continually, but it is in his proper line, called by Aſtronomers, <hi>The Eclipticke line;</hi> So a godly man is alwayes moveing in the way of godlines,
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:153845:295"/> that's his proper line, and he never moves out of it wholy; Hee may have (through the power of corruption and temptation) his wandrings and goings aſtray, but then he hath his repentings and returnings into the way againe; he cannot abide long much leſſe alwayes in the pathes of darknes; Hee comes to himſelfe with the prodigal, and then he comes to his father, he bethinkes himſelfe where he is, and comes backes into the path where he ought to be; if at any time he walke in the counſel of the ungodly (the gradation is made in the firſt Pſalme) which thing he ought not to doe, yet ſurely he will not (as it followes) <hi>ſtand in the way of ſinners,</hi> or if he ſtand a while in that way, yet, he will not <hi>ſit downe in the ſeat of the ſcornfull;</hi> he will not reſt nor ſtay there. Now as it is an argument and a marke of Godlines, when a man findes, that though he hath many faylings and wandrings, yet he abideth not in the pathes of darknes; ſo it is an argument of the noughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of a mans heart and ſtate, when though he now and then hits upon the doing of a good thing, yet he abides not in the pathes of light. Vaine thoughts (as the Prophet Reproves the <hi>Jewes</hi>) lodge in the wicked ſo long, that the Lord complaines, <hi>How long ſhall vaine thoughts lodge in you?</hi> But as good thoughts ſeldome come to an ungodly man, ſo they lodge not at all with him; they are great ſtrangers to him, and he uſeth them as the worſt of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, yea as enemies, he quickly turnes them off, yea he thruſts them away from him, he abideth not in the pathes of light.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> having thus ſet forth the Spirit of a wicked man, by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt the light, by his unaffectednes with and unſtayed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the wayes and pathes of it, proceeds to give us a further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his wicked courſes and workes of darknes.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The murtherer is hee that killeth a man without warrant and authority; every ſlaying of a man is not murther, but to ſlay a man, or to take away the life of a man without warrant, that's murther: And that's the groſſe ſinne forbidden in the ſixt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill, or thou ſhalt doe no murther.</hi> And this is uſually committed eyther in malice to the perſon, or in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe after the ſpoyle. Some take away the life of a man in
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:153845:296"/> malice to his perſon, they hate him deliberately, as <hi>Cain</hi> did <hi>Abel,</hi> and therefore they kill him. Others have no quarrel to the man, poſſibly they never ſaw him before, but they covet his goods, and that they may rob him of his goods, they rob him of his life. They are ſuch as live upon the ſpoyle, and they will ſpoyle, though they cauſe the innocent to dye for it, and themſelves too in the end. In eyther of theſe wayes, wee may underſtand the murtherer here. The former, becauſe 'tis ſayd in the next words, <hi>He ſlayes the poore and needy, and there is little gaine in their blood when they goe downe into the pit.</hi> The latter, becauſe 'tis ſayd in the latter part of the verſe, <hi>That in the night he is as a theife.</hi> But <hi>Job</hi> firſt ſhewes us that this murtherer is a diligent man.</p>
                  <q>Riſing with the light.</q>
                  <p>That is, riſing as early, or as ſoon as the light riſeth. The mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer is no ſluggard, the light doth not finde him in bed; he takes the prime of the morning, he will looſe no time. Men who love hunting riſe early; So doe theſe hunters of men. <hi>When the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is light they practice it,</hi> ſaith the Prophet (<hi>Mich.</hi> 2.1.) Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men riſe early to goe about the workes of their Calling, and wicked men riſe early to fulfill the luſts of their hearts. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.7.) <hi>I will early deſtroy all the wicked of the Earth;</hi> As if <hi>David</hi> had ſayd, I will riſe with the light to deſtroy the wicked; and here you ſee how the wicked are deſcribed riſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Early to deſtroy the righteous, to murther the Innocent. So the next words expreſſe the deſigne of his early riſing; <hi>He riſeth with the light;</hi> what to doe? no good I warrant you, 'tis</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To kill the poore and needy.</hi> That's his buſienes; He begins his mornings worke with a worke of cruelty; you heare of killing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently. The murtherers heart is full of blood, and it will not be long ere his hand be full too, for <hi>their feete are ſwift to ſhed blood (Rom.</hi> 3.15.) and they are skilfull to deſtroy. But it may ſeeme that they are not very wiſe for themſelves, though they are very bloody againſt others; For <hi>Job</hi> doth not ſay, they ſlay the fat and full ones, but
<q>The poore and needy.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are ſome who diſtinguiſh between theſe two, and tell us that in theſe two words, two yea all ſorts of poore are Included.</p>
                  <pb n="565" facs="tcp:153845:296"/>
                  <p>The firſt word, they ſay, intends thoſe poore who heretofore were rich, but now empoveriſhed or fallen into poverty; and that by the ſecond word are meant thoſe who have been born and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes bred up in a low condition; But wee need not ſtand upon ſuch nicities in diſtinguiſhing between the poore and needy. But it may be enquired, why doth the murtherer kill the poore? what doth he get by that? where are the ſpoyles which he brings home? There's nothing to be had from them who have nothing, The poore and needy. And it hath been antiently ſaid, <hi>The empty tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller will ſing before the Theife;</hi> why then ſhould the Theife or the murtherer meddle with, eſpecially why ſhould he kill the poore and needy? <hi>What have they? or what have they done?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Two things may be ſayd in anſwer to theſe queries; firſt, it is thus expreſt to ſhew the extreame wickednes of the murtherer, who doth not care ſo much for booty as for blood. 'Tis for that he thirſts, his delight is in cruelty, therefore he kills the very poore and needy, the next man he meets with, let him be what he will. 'Tis the ſin it ſelfe, or to doe wickedly, which ſome men delight in, they care not whether any advantage or profit come in by it; when they have their will, when they have don what they would, that's reward enough for them.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <q>Some will doe wickedly, though they get nothing by it.</q>
                  <p>All the true ſervants of God love the work which he ſets them, better then the reward which he gives them, and ſo doe ſome ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Devill. Even the Devill hath ſervants who ſcorne to be mercinary. The act of ſin is ſweeter to them then any profit that ſin can bring in; <hi>They are exact and perfect ſinners, who ſin out of love to the very act of ſinning:</hi> As the higheſt acting in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes is to be pleaſed with pure acts of holines; To doe them though wee ſhould get nothing by doing them, though we make no earnings, though we ſee no preſent fruit in doing them. Thus (I ſay) to goe onne in wayes of holynes when the wayes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes appeare barren and unprofitable to us, yea when they are unſafe and dangerous to us, here's the perfection of holynes. So the perfection of wickednes is to be wicked when nothing is gott by it; it ſhewes a ſincere love to ſin (as I may ſay) to love ſin for ſins ſake; as it ſhewes a ſincere love to Grace and goodnes,
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:153845:297"/> to love them for their owne or Gods ſake. Hypocrites love the wayes of God for the ſpoyle which they finde there, for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal advantages which they meete with there; were thoſe wayes poore and needy, leane and empty, they ſhould not at all be filled with their company. The prophane will riſe up in Judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe profeſſors, for <hi>they kill the poore and needy;</hi> They doe evill, where they cannot have any hopes of receaving good by it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For anſwer; By <hi>The poore and needy,</hi> wee may here underſtand the Innocent and honeſt, not as if all who are poore and needy, were alſo Innocent (for there are many wicked poore) nor as if all who are innocent, were alſo poore and needy (for there are many godly rich) but becauſe uſually they are ſo: men that are rich and great may be Innocent and holy, but theſe are rare conjunctions; uſually the Innocent are poore and needy. Againe, wee are not to take the poore and needy for them who (as wee ſay) have not a peny to buy them bread, but by the poore we underſtand thoſe of the midle or rather Inferiour ranke, ſuch <hi>poore and needy they kill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what's their quarrell at them?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe ſuch poore honeſt men ſtand in the light of wicked men, that is the wicked cannot be ſo wicked as they would, becauſe ſome good men are neere them, and therefore they muſt be removed out of the world, that they may be out of their way. Or, ſecondly, becauſe ſuch poore honeſt men eyther have given, or are ready to give evidence, or be witneſſes againſt them before the Magiſtrate: now, eyther to prevent or revenge this, they <hi>riſe with the light and kill the poore and needy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>That a wicked man will doe his utmoſt to remove thoſe who ſtand in his way, or oppoſe him in his wickednes.</q>
                  <p>He will kill ſome that he may vex others; that's his ayme here, the poore and needy are not his utmoſt ayme; but the poore and needy ſtand in his way, they hinder him in his other projects. And whatſoever interpoſeth between him and the enjoyment of his luſt, he will remove it if he can. And as he will kill ſome that he may vex others, ſo he will much rather kill thoſe who vex him. Holy <hi>David</hi> being left under the power of a ſtrong Temptation,
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:153845:297"/> ſlew <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> an innocent man, only becauſe he could not perſwade him to do that which might have bin ſome covering of his ſin from the eyes of men. How much more will the prophane doe ſo, when honeſt men doe eyther profeſſedly oppoſe them in their ſinfull workes, or diſcover the ſinfullnes of them.</p>
                  <p>Further, In that <hi>Job</hi> upon the freſh account which he gives of the wickedneſſes of men, brings in the murtherer in the firſt place, riſeing with the light and killing the poore and needy. Wee may here take notice, a little, of the greatnes of this ſin of murther, and demonſtrate how great a ſinner the murtherer is. The mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer is a ſinner of the higheſt forme, and there are two Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Conſiderations in generall, upon which we may make this out.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, How ſinfull is it for a man to murther a man, when as the Scripture tels us that if a beaſt kill a man he muſt ſuffer for it: (<hi>Exod.</hi> 21.28.) <hi>If an oxe gore a man or a woman that they dye, the oxe ſhall be ſurely ſtoned, and his fleſh ſhall not be Eaten.</hi> A beaſt is not capable of ſubjection to a moral rule or law, as not being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of reaſon, yet a beaſt who is not properly under any Law muſt dye for tranſgreſſing this Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill;</hi> And this ſurely, Firſt, to convince man of the greatnes of this ſin; ſecondly, to admoniſh him leſt he commit this ſin; thirdly, to aſſure him, that if he do he muſt dye; For if a beaſt muſt dye for killing a man, then much more muſt man, ſeeing that Law, againſt the killing of a man, was given to men, not to beaſts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Lord gave a rule to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> what to doe for the removing of the guilt of blood, in caſe a man were found ſlaine and no man could tell who was the Author of that murther, read this at large (<hi>Deut.</hi> 21.) from the beginning of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the end of the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe; <hi>If one be found ſlaine in the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, and it be not knowne</hi> (after diligent enquiry, or hue and cry) <hi>who hath ſlaine him; Then the Elders of thy Judges ſhall come forth, and they ſhall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> (in caſe there be a doubt which City was neereſt to the place where the ſlaine was found) <hi>unto the Cities which are round about him that is ſlaine. And it ſhall come to paſſe, that the City which is next unto the ſlaine man</hi> (for from thence it was moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the murtherer came, or that thither he was fled to hide and conceale himſelfe, therefore) <hi>even the Elders of that City ſhall
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:153845:298"/> take an heifer which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawne in the yoke</hi> (therein fitly ſhadowing the murtherer, in whoſe ſtead the heifer was to be ſlaine; for ſuch are ſons of <hi>Belial,</hi> men who will not beare the yoke of obedience) <hi>And the Elders of the City ſhall bring downe the heifer into a rough valley</hi> (the very place was to carry a reſemblance of a murtherous ſpirit, and of the act of murther, both being rough and uncouth) <hi>and ſhall ſtrike off the heifers necke there in the valley</hi> (implying that if they could have got the murtherer into their hands, he muſt have dyed under their hand.) Then the Prieſt muſt come to decide the controverſie (<hi>ver.</hi> 5.) and (at the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe) <hi>The Elders of the City that are next unto the ſlaine man, ſhall waſh their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley</hi> (waſhing of the hands, was, firſt, an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that blood defileth; ſecondly, it was a ceremony which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed innocence and clearenes from blood, as appeares by a like action of <hi>Pilate (Math.</hi> 27.24.) But theſe Elders muſt not onely uſe this ſpeaking ceremony, to ſhew their innocency, but they muſt explicitly profeſſe it (<hi>ver.</hi> 7.) <hi>And they ſhall anſwer and ſay, our hands have not ſhed this blood, neither have our eyes ſeene it.</hi> And then the Prieſt muſt pray (<hi>ver.</hi> 8, 9.) <hi>Be mercifull O Lord, unto thy people Iſrael, whom thou haſt redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Iſraels charge, and the blood ſhall be forgiven, ſo ſhalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you, when thou ſhalt doe that which is right in the ſight of the Lord.</hi> This ſolemne Law and the manner of proceeding upon it, ſhewes three things, as to the poynt in hand. Firſt, that the Lord is very tender of ſhedding mans bloud; ſecondly, that the ſhedding of mans blood in any murtherous way is extreamely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to him. Thirdly, That God will certainly bring ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance one time or other firſt or laſt, upon the murtherer, ſeeing a whole City ſhould be charged, in ſome degree, with the blood of a man ſlaine neere them, if they did not publickly and ſolemnly declare and teſtifie their clearenes from it.</p>
                  <p>But beſides theſe two general Conſiderations taken from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and now inſtanced in; There are many other grounded both upon Scripture Authority, and common reaſon, which ſet forth the vilenes of this ſin of murther.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Murther offereth violence to nature in common, there being but one common nature in all men. And hence</p>
                  <pb n="569" facs="tcp:153845:298"/>
                  <p>Secondly, He that murthers another offers violence to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; for though there be a ſpeciall ſin of ſelfe-murther, yet the murther of another is ſelfe-murther too, and that not onely as it is an offering of violence to common nature, but alſo as it layes the murderers owne perſon open &amp; obnoxious unto violence, and that, both to the violence of a private revenge, and to the violence of publicke Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Murther deſtroyes ſociety, men will never live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where they finde themſelves continually in danger of their lives: Man is a ſociable creature by nature, how ſinful then is mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which breakes the very firſt fundamental lawes of Nature?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Murther doth not onely defile the perſon that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits it, but the land alſo in which it is committed. (<hi>Numb.</hi> 35.31.33.) <hi>Yee ſhall take no ſatisfaction for the life of a murtherer, which is guilty of death, and he ſhall ſurely be put to death; ſo ye ſhall not pollute the land wherein ye are; for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleanſed of the blood that is ſhed therein, but by the blood of him that ſhed it.</hi> Murther as acted defileth the perſon onely that acts it, but murther (when knowne) defileth a whole land, if it goe unpuniſhed. In which caſe there may be defilement upon a land by many other ſinnes, but this is eſpecially expreſt of murther, as if that among and above all ſins were the <hi>land-defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Murther is not onely an injury to man, but an impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt God; and that's the reaſon given in the firſt Law which God made againſt it, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6.) <hi>Who ſo ſheddeth mans blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed, for in the Image of God made he man.</hi> For though the body of a man ſlaine be not in the Image of God, yet the perſon ſlaine is, even the perſon of a wicked man hath ſomewhat of the Image of God remaining in him. And therefore that law is to be expounded univerſally; whoſoever the man is, whether good or bad, righteous or wicked, whoſe blood is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſly ſhed; <hi>by man</hi> (that is, <hi>by man</hi> who hath a call to it as being a Magiſtrate) <hi>ſhall his blood be ſhed,</hi> that is, he by his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſhall (upon proofe) condemne him to dye, and ſhall give him up to execution. A contempt of the Image of God in man, is a contempt of God. And he takes it as a high affront to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, that any ſhould preſume to deface or ſpoyle his Image, And this doth more aggravate their ſin, who oppoſe, vexe, and deſtroy
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:153845:299"/> godly men, becauſe they oppoſe that more excellent Image of God, the new Creature, or the Image of God renewed in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and true holynes. As there is an image or likenes of God in every man, ſo much more in a godly man, for Godlynes is true God-likenes. Therefore to ſhed the blood of a Godly man is a higher affront to the Majeſty of God. <hi>As the new wine is in the cluſter, and one ſaith deſtroy it not for a bleſſing is in it</hi> (Iſa. 65.8.) So we may ſay, deſtroy not a Godly man, for a bleſſing is in him, (firſt, from God, and, ſecondly, for men) but we may ſay much more, <hi>Deſtroy him not</hi> for the Image of God is in him.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Murther deprives us of that which is moſt precious in the whole compaſſe of nature; And according to the value of that wherein the damage is received, is the greatnes of the ſin commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Satan repreſented life better then all other things (<hi>Job</hi> 2.4.) <hi>Skin for skin and all that a man hath will he give for his life;</hi> Gold and ſilver, houſes and lands are but toyes and trifles to life. There is nothing of man except his ſoule (which cannot dye) better then his life. And this the murtherer takes away. A mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer is the greateſt theife, and the vaineſt one, he ſteales away that from another which is to him of higheſt value, yet that which himſelfe cannot carry away, nor make any uſe of.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, The ſinfullnes of murther appeares in this; That it is not onely a wrong to that particular perſon who is murdered, but a wrong to all that have dependance upon him. The life of one man may have an Influence upon many; wife and children, the whole family, and kindred, all relations, and employments, whether more private, or publicke, are wronged and ſuffer in his death. Though that which cuts off a mans life, cannot cut off his owne hope (if he have a wel-grounded one) for things to come, yet it cuts off the hopes of all others depending upon him (as an inſtrument in the hand of God) for good things preſent.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, The murtherer takes away that from a man which no man can reſtore to him, or repaire him in; he takes away that which is Impoſſible for him to give againe. He that tooke away a mans goods was bound by the law of God to reſtore it fourefold, or fivefold, or ſevenfold, (according to the caſe) and poſſibly he might reſtore it an hundredfold, but he that takes away a mans life, hath taken that which (though he would) he cannot reſtore ſo much as ſingle. The law of nature will not ſuffer the murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:153845:299"/> to reſtore life, for 'tis like water which being ſpilt cannot (by any humane power) be gathered up againe; and the law of God ſaith concerning the ſin of murther, that no ſatisfaction ſhall be taken for it, and indeed none can. For though ſome would commute and have (by the ſinfull indulgence and cruel pity of unjuſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates) commuted for it, yet none could ever ſatisfie for it. And when Magiſtrates eyther through foule corruption, or foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh compaſſion, have not taken vengeance upon the murtherer in kinde, but have ſuffered him to commute, or compound for that ſin, eyther by paying a pecuniary penalty, or by undergoing ſome puniſhment leſſe then death, God hath taken vengeance upon them for it, and hath ſayd to them in his providences as he ſayd to <hi>Ahab</hi> by his Prophet for the ſparing of <hi>Benhadad</hi> (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.42.) <hi>Becauſe ye have let goe out of your hand a man whom I had appointed to utter deſtruction, therefore your life ſhall goe for his life, and your people ſhall be cut off by the ſword, becauſe your ſword did not cut off the murderer.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Si magiſtratus ceſſent ab officio deus ipſe inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtas caedes fame peſte &amp; bellis externis aut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtinis ulciſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Merl.</hi>

                  <p>Laſtly, The murtherer hurts others, but he chiefely hurts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Some expound <hi>Lamech</hi> confeſſing this with ſorrow (<hi>Gen.</hi> 4.23.) while he ſaid unto his wives, <hi>Hearken unto my ſpeech, for I have ſlaine a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.</hi> There are divers other Interpretations and readings of thoſe words, and we put in the Margin, <hi>I would ſlay a man in my wound, and a young man in my hurt,</hi> As if he had boaſted of his ſtrength to his wives, that though he were weake with wounds and hurts, yet he would venture to fight with any man, and doubted not to get victory over him &amp; kill him: and ſo the words carry a ſence like that ſpeech of the Prophet (<hi>Jer.</hi> 37.10.) telling the <hi>Jewes</hi> that theirs were vaine confidences while they hoped to be delivered from the <hi>Caldeans</hi> who beſieged them; <hi>for,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Though there remained but wounded men among them, yet they ſhould riſe up every man in his tent, and burne this City with fire.</hi> But as to our read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I have ſlaine a man to my wounding.</hi> Some expound it onely of a bodily wounding, I have got a wound my ſelfe, or I have hurt my ſelfe while I ſlew a man; much more is this true of a ſpirituall wounding, and hurt to the ſoule and Conſcience; for though a murtherer ſlay a man, and come off with a whole skin, yet he ſlayeth a man to his wounding, and killeth him to his hurt. The
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:153845:300"/> Rabbins have a tradition upon that place; that <hi>Lamech</hi> having been a great hunter in his younger dayes being then growne old was led forth by his young man to take his pleaſure in hunting, and ſhooting at Deere, and that while he was in this diſport or exerciſe in the feild, <hi>Cain</hi> paſſed by, and the young man poynted him to <hi>Cain, Lamech</hi> (being dim-ſighted) ſhot at <hi>Cain</hi> and killed him in ſtead of a wild beaſt; but ſoone after diſcovering that he had killed <hi>Cain,</hi> turned to the young man his guide in a paſſionate anger and killed him alſo. This relation they give as the reaſon why <hi>Lamech</hi> ſayd, <hi>I have ſlaine a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt:</hi> but I ſhall not ſtay upon that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the <hi>Jewes;</hi> and ſhall onely make ſo much uſe of <hi>Lamechs</hi> confeſſion, as at leaſt to illuſtrate, if not to prove, the poynt in hand, that he who ſlayeth a man doth it to his owne hurt and wounding, often to the wounding of his body, eſtate, and honour, alwayes to the wounding of his owne ſoule and conſcience. Every ſin in ſome degree or other wounds the ſoule; But the wounding of others to death is the chiefe ſin (of all ſins againſt the body and outward concernments of man) which woundeth a mans ſoule. The murtherer at one blow ſtrikes through the body of his neighbour and his owne ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Further, we might obſerve from thoſe words in the text, <hi>riſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the light:</hi>
                     <q>That murderers, and indeed any ſort of wicked doers, are diligent and laborious to doe the commands of their vileſt luſts.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I noted this at the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe upon thoſe words, <hi>Riſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for a prey,</hi> I ſhall not ſtay upon it here. I onely adde this; Let not us be ſloathfull in doing good, ſeeing the murderer is ſo diligent and early up for the doing of miſchiefe.</p>
                  <q>And in the night is as a Thiefe.</q>
                  <p>Theſe words may be taken two wayes; For</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Particle, <hi>as,</hi> is by ſome conceived not to be a note of ſimilitude, but to carry on a direct predication, <hi>He is as a thiefe,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Particula quaſi non dicit ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem ſed proprietatem.</note> 
                     <hi>He is a very thiefe.</hi> We finde elſewhere in Scripture, that a particle of likenes doth not onely note the likenes of one thing to another, but the ſamenes of one thing with another. Taking it thus here; The meaning of the words is as if <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid, <hi>He ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:153845:300"/> betimes in the morning to play the murtherer, and in the night hee playe's the thiefe.</hi> I have noted the ſame ſence of the particle heretofore, firſt, from thoſe words of the Evangeliſt concerning Chriſt (<hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14.) <hi>Wee ſaw his glory as the glory of the onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of God;</hi> for Chriſt was not onely like the onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son of God, but he was really ſo: as alſo from that of the Prophet (<hi>Hoſea</hi> 5.10.) <hi>The Princes of Judah were as or like them that remove the bound,</hi> that is, they did remove the bound.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others keepe to the ſimilitude, and ſay the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Job</hi> is not, that the murtherer doth turne theife, or that he proceeds from killing in the day to ſtealing in the night;<note place="margin">Facere aliquid tanquam fur eſt proverbialis lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutio, quae im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portat ſecretam diligentem<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> abſcenſionem.</note> But ſay they, this verſe is quite through a deſcription of the murtherer, as the next is of the Adulterer. So that to ſay, <hi>In the night he is as a Thiefe,</hi> imports onely this; That in the night he doth carry himſelfe very cloſely, and very ſecretly, or that as a theife in the night is cloſe and ſudden in ſtealing, ſo is he the murtherer in kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. We have this ſimilitude often uſed (1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.2.) <hi>The Coming of Chriſt ſhall be as a Theife in the night.</hi> Read alſo (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.15.) in which the ſame ſimilitude of a Theife in the night is applyed to Chriſts coming, not as if we could hence conclude, that Chriſt will come in the night time, but that, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he comes it ſhall be as in the night, that is, ſuddenly, and (as to any antecedent appearances) ſecretly upon the world, it ſhall be unexpected to them, they ſhall not know the time of it, nor ſhall they be aware of it, though, when he is once come, his comming ſhall be accompanyed with ſo much light and luſter, with ſo much ſplendour and power, as ſhall not onely awaken, but aſtoniſh all the world. Thus it may be ſayd of the murtherer, <hi>In the night he is as a Theife.</hi> And</p>
                  <p>Hence, it may be noted.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That wicked men give themſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ves wholly to watch oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of doing miſchiefe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The murtherer riſeth early in the morning, and in the night is as a Theife: hee takes his advantages in the day, and hee will not forbeare them in the night. As it ſhewes the great aſſiduity of Saints in prayer when it is ſayd, <hi>They cry to God day and night</hi> (Luk. 18.7.) day and night reach the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of time. So while <hi>Job</hi> tells us that the wicked are doing miſchiefe betimes in the morning, and that they are at it againe
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:153845:301"/> in the night, if not all the night, What can be ſayd more for their watchfullnes and aſſiduity in doing miſchiefe? The Apoſtle (<hi>Eph.</hi> 5.16.) exhorteth Saints <hi>to redeeme the time becauſe the dayes are evill;</hi> but we ſee in the preſent example, alledged by <hi>Job,</hi> that wicked men will redeeme the time, that they may doe evill. We cannot poſſibly redeeme the time, by recalling or bringing backe the time which is paſt, but we may redeeme the time by our more diligent <hi>actings in the time preſent;</hi> Now, who can act more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently in improving the time preſent, then they who are at worke both day and night, which two diſtinctions of time include and cary all time. Let not the Godly be found Idling away the day, while the wicked are found labouring (at their worke, ſuch as it is) in the very night.</p>
                  <p>Againe, Wee may note.</p>
                  <q>That the murtherer doth his bloody buiſines not onely diligently, but cloſely.</q>
                  <p>He doth it as a theife in the night. The murtherer, who is at all times feirce and cruel, will ſometimes be ſubtle and cunning; and this is the guiſe of other ſinners too, eſpecially of the Adulterer, whoſe ſecret conveyances and cloſe contrivances for the attaining of his filthy delights, are elegantly deſcribed in the words which follow.</p>

                  <p>Before I come to open the particular termes of this clauſe, or to raiſe any obſervations from it, I ſhall give in ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Adultery in generall, which is the ſpeciall ſubject of the whole verſe. Adultery is the breach of the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Commandement. And in that Commandement a twofold Adultery is forbidden. Firſt, Mentall, or the adultery of the minde; ſecondly, Corporall, or the adultery of the body. It was the former which Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, when he corrected the falſe gloſſe or expoſition of the Phariſees about the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Commandement, (<hi>Math.</hi> 5.27, 28.) <hi>Yee have heard that it was ſaid by them of old time, Thou ſhalt not commit adultery; but I ſay unto you, whoſoever looketh on a woman to luſt after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.</hi> By which it appeares, that the Phariſees, who were the chiefe interpreters of the Law in thoſe times, limited the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement againſt Adultery to the outward act; but Chriſt the Law-giver who beſt knew the mind of the Law, enlarged it to the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of the internal act, &amp; told them that there is a heart-adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, an adultery in thought, occaſion'd by a vaine or wanton glance
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:153845:302"/> and caſt of the eye, as wel as there's an Adultery of the body, or in the outward act.</p>
                  <p>The text in hand ſpeakes onely of corporal Adultery, though the other be not excluded as being the roote of it.<note place="margin">Latinae voces adulteri &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterae hanc vim habent ut adulter ad alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram, adultera ad A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>terum ſe conferat. <hi>Feſt:</hi>
                     </note> And This cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall adultery is taken in Scripture ſomtimes ſtrictly, when eyther man or woman to ſatisfie their luſt with others break their conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Bond; and is eyther that act of uncleaneneſſe which is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by perſons who are both engaged by marriage-covenant to mutuall faithfulnes, or when at leaſt one of them is under that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement. This latter is properly called ſingle adultery; the former is double Adultery, or corporal Adultery in the higheſt and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſence of it. Secondly, Corporal Adultery is taken more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or in a lower ſence for fornication or bodyly uncleaneneſſe of any kinde between man and woman. And ſo it is intended in the Commandement given againſt it; <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The foulenes and greatnes of this ſin of adultery (take it in ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſence) appeares many wayes. The Apoſtle puts it in the front of the workes of the fleſh (<hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19.) <hi>Now the workes of the fleſh are manifeſt, which are theſe, Adultery, fornication, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe, laſciviouſneſſe,</hi> there is adultery with all its retinue; and (<hi>Col.</hi> 3.5.) it is ſet as the firſt of our earthly members, which are to be mortified; <hi>mortifie therfore your members which are upon earth, fornication, uncleaneneſſe, inordinate affection.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in other Scriptures fornication is included under adultery, in this adultery is included under fornication.</p>
                  <p>Adultery ſtrictly taken, hath a ſpeciall ſinfullneſſe in it. Firſt, as it is the breach of a Covenant; every ſin hath in it a breach of Covenant in generall, but there is a ſuperadded breach of a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Covenant in this ſin. Hence <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of the Adultereſſe (<hi>Pro.</hi> 2.17.) that ſhee <hi>forſaketh the guide of her youth.</hi> One of the Rabbines expounds this woman myſtically for the ſenſitive appetite, and that ſhee is ſayd to <hi>forſake the guide of her youth,</hi> becauſe in youth appetite commonly forſakes reaſon, which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted to be the guide of it. But we may expound this guide ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for her father, who had the government of her in her younger yeares, or elſe for her husband whom ſhe married in her youth, and whom by marriage ſhee receaved as the guide of her youth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God, who is indeed the guide both of our youth and old age:
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:153845:302"/> and what guide ſoever the wife forſaketh, ſhee cheifely forſaketh God who is her chiefe guide, <hi>and forgetteth the covenant of her God,</hi> that is, the covenant which God gave her in reference to that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular eſtate of marriage. Every beleever is in covenant with God, in reference to his ſpirituall eſtate, but a married perſon hath a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God in reference to that civil ſtate; And Adultery is the breach of this covenant.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This ſhewes the ſinfullneſſe of Adultery, that it is a ſin which cannot be committed alone, there is alwayes a double ſin, in this ſin of adultery, two are defiled with it at once. In which ſenſe it is worſe then murther, and theft; For theſe may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and but one defiled with the ſinfullnes of them. He that robs is guilty of ſtealing, not he that is robbed; He that murders is guilty of blood, not he that is murdered; But in Adultery, the Agent and patient are both alike guilty of uncleanenes; The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement reacheth both.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The evill of this ſin appeares, by the many and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold evills which it brings with it. <hi>Solomon</hi> hath ſet them forth very particularly and fully (<hi>Pro.</hi> 6.26, 27, 28, 29, 30.) <hi>Luſt not after her</hi> (that is, after the ſtrange woman) <hi>in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eyelids,</hi> (why not? Firſt, thou mayeſt be undone in thy outward eſtate) <hi>by meanes of a whoriſh woman a man is brought to a peice of bread,</hi> (that is, he is ruin'd in all he hath by it, and brought to ſo low an ebbe of poverty, that he hath ſcarce the worth of a peice of bread left) <hi>And</hi> (which is both a ſecond and a worſe evill) <hi>the adultereſſe will hunt for the pretious life,</hi> which may either be underſtood of the naturall life, (ſometimes the adulterer is murtherd by the adultereſſe) or of that which is a more pretious life then the natural, even the life of the ſoule, or the eternal good and happineſſe of the ſoule, ſhe cares not to deſtroy body, and ſoule for ever (ſo her luſt may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied) that's the gaine which the adultereſſe purſues; <hi>ſhee hunts for the pretious life,</hi> the life of the ſoule. Thirdly, <hi>Solomon</hi> deſcribes the evill of this ſin in the 27 and 28 verſes, by the guilt which it inevitably brings with it; <hi>Can a man take fire in his boſome, and his cloathes not be burnt? can a man goe upon hot coales, and his feete not be burnt? So he that goeth into his neighbours wife, whoſoever toucheth her ſhall not be innocent,</hi> that is, he ſhall ſurely be very guilty. As if he had ſayd, You can no more retaine your innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:153845:303"/> while you commit this folly, then you can avoyd being burnt when you carry fire in your boſome, or tread upon burning coales. Fourthly, the ſinfullnes of this ſin appeares, by the compariſon which the Scripture makes between it and theft, (<hi>Pro.</hi> 6.30, 31.) <hi>Men doe not deſpiſe a theife,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ferenda eſt magis omnis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitas quam perpetranda ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua iniquitas.</note> 
                     <hi>if he ſteale to ſatisfie his ſoule when he is hungry;</hi> it is a ſin to ſteale, though it be to ſatisfie hunger; no neceſſity can excuſe iniquity; and we ſhould rather chuſe to ſtarve then ſteale, if at leaſt that may be called ſtealing, which is done meerly to avoyd ſtarving; Therefore (ſaith <hi>Solomon) if he be found, he ſhall reſtore ſeavenfold, he ſhall give all the ſubſtance of his houſe;</hi> yet this ſin of ſtealing which is to ſatisfie hunger is but a ſmall ſin compared with Adultery, which is onely to ſatisfie a mans luſt and beaſtiall ſenſualnes. This <hi>Solomon</hi> affirmes to us in the next words; <hi>But who ſo committeth adultery with a woman lacketh underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he that doth it deſtroyeth his owne ſoule.</hi> He that ſtealeth, upon thoſe termes doth it for want, but he that commits adultery upon any termes, doth it for wantonnes. He that ſtealeth doth it for lacke of bread, but he that commits adultery doth it for lacke of underſtanding. He that ſtealeth when he is hungry doth it to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his ſoule, but he that committeth Adultery, (though he doth it not with an intent to deſtroy his ſoule, yet in the iſſue he) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth his owne ſoule. But is not ſtealing a ſoule-deſtroying ſin too? I anſwer, it is; and ſo is every ſin in its owne nature, but there are ſome ſins (and among theſe Adultery is a chiefe one) which in the event prove uſually more deſtructive to the ſoule, and have oftener deſtroyed it. And as this ſin doth very often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the ſoule as to its happines hereafter; ſo it deſtroyeth it as to its abiding here. Thus the ſoule may be ſayd to be deſtroyed when the life is deſtroyed; and this deſtruction of the ſoule, <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſeemes directly to ayme at, as the next words lead us to Judge (<hi>ver.</hi> 33.) <hi>A wound and diſhonour ſhall he get, and his reproach ſhall not be wiped away, for jealouſie is the rage of a man, therefore he will not ſpare in the day of vengeance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another Scripture to be much minded in this poynt is that of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> (1 Cor. 6.13, 14.) where writing to the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> (among which people that ſin was very common before they were called to the knowledge of Chriſt by the preaching of the Goſpel) he urgeth many arguments upon their conſciences, to prevent their relapſe into it. And we may diſcover ſix argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:153845:303"/> which the Apoſtle uſeth in that place; I ſhall onely touch them, and ſo returne to the text in hand. The firſt appeares at the cloſe of the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>Now the body is not for fornication but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body;</hi> As if he had ſaid, you put the body to a uſe for which it was never intended, <hi>the body is not for fornication,</hi> but, <hi>for the Lord,</hi> that is, for the Lords uſe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and the Lord is for the body, that is, for the good and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the body. Such is the wonderfull goodneſſe of God, that looke in whatſoever we are for him, he is for us; As our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes are for the Lords ſervice as well as our ſoules, ſo the Lord is for the good of our bodyes, as well as for the good of our ſoules. And therefore our bodyes ought to be imployed for his Glory in every thing. The ſecond argument is taken from the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; <hi>God hath both raiſed up the Lord, and will alſo raiſe up us by his owne power,</hi> (ver. 14.) As if he had ſayd, your bodyes ſhall be raiſed againe; if they were to be loſt in the duſt, then it were no great matter how you did defile, and abuſe them, but as God hath raiſed up the Lord, ſo he will raiſe you up. Seeing then God hath promiſed, and you are ſuch as profeſſe faith in that promiſe, that your bodyes ſhall be raiſed up out of the duſt, to put on glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as a Garment in the laſt day, therefote in the meane time (while your bodyes are in your keeping) doe ye keepe your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes pure. Thirdly, He argues thus with the beleeving <hi>Corinthians, (v.</hi> 15th) <hi>Know ye not that your bodyos are the members of Chriſt;</hi> not onely is the ſoule of a beleever a member of Chriſt, but his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy too, yet it is not properly eyther the body or the ſoule that is a member of Chriſt, but the perſon; for the union is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and the perſon of a beleever, conſiſting of ſoule and body. But thus the Apoſtle argues, <hi>Know ye not that your bodyes are the members of Chriſt, ſhall I then take the members of Chriſt, and make them members of an harlot, God forbid.</hi> What! will ye diſpoſe the members of Chriſt to ſo baſe a uſe? will ye who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, your ſelves joyned to Chriſt, condiſcend to ſuch a baſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction? And hence he expoſtulates at the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſes, <hi>What? know ye not that he which is joyned to an harlot is one body for two, ſaith he, ſhall be one fleſh,</hi> (They who abuſe marriage, are as the marryed, The Adulterer and the harlot are one fleſh as well as the husband and the wife) <hi>but he that is joyned to the Lord</hi> (by faith and love) <hi>is one ſpirit;</hi> He hath a neerer and a more noble
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:153845:304"/> union then that of fleſh, and therefore he ought to maintame the hight of honour and purity, both in minde and body; and as he is one Spirit with the Lord, ſo to make it good that he is guided and governed by one Spirit, and that <hi>The holy One.</hi> We have a fourth argument at the 18<hi rend="sup">•h</hi> verſe, <hi>Flee fornication,</hi> why ſo? The reaſon is added, <hi>every ſin that a man doth is without the body, but he that committeth fornication, ſinneth againſt his owne body.</hi> But are all other ſins without the body? I anſwer; firſt, other ſinnes have the body as an inſtrument for the committing of them; if a man ſteale, the body is an inſtrument, if a man commit murther, the body is an inſtrument, but in this ſin the body is more inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall then in other ſins, the body is cheifely inſtrumentall, in this ſin; ſo that comparatively to this, <hi>every ſin that a man doth is without the body.</hi> And therefore this ſin is more againſt the body then other ſins are. Againe ſecondly, when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>every ſin is without the body,</hi> he is to be underſtood of thoſe ſinnes which are externall, otherwiſe every ſin that a man commits is not without the body, there are a thouſand acts of ſin that are done within the body, or in the ſoule, envy, wrath, malice, are ſinnes within the body, being bred and acted in the Spirit. But we may ſay of every ſin which is externall, (about which the diſcourſe there is) that comparatively to this ſin of adultery &amp; fornication, it is without the body. I anſwer, thirdly, The body is not onely the inſtrument of this ſin, but the object of it alſo; for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane perſon doth not onely ſin with his body, but he ſins againſt his body; Adultery leaves that blot and brand of ignominy and baſenes upon the body, which no other ſin doth, making it the member of a harlot, as was toucht before, and degrading it from that excellent honour whereunto God advanced it, even in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall conſideration, much more degrading it from that honour, whereuntor God hath advanced it in a ſpirituall conſideration. And as that was the Apoſtles third Argument, ſo, upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther relation of the bodyes of beleevers, he makes his 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is layd downe at the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe; <hi>What? know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy-Ghoſt, which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your owne;</hi> As if he had ſayd, <hi>A Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is a holy and ſacred thing, and will ye defile the Temple of the Holy-Ghoſt?</hi> The <hi>Jewes,</hi> how angry were they? what an uproar did they make, when they thought <hi>Paul</hi> had brought Greeks into
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:153845:304"/> the Temple, who by the law were looked upon as prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſo not to be admitted to come there; they cry out, <hi>This is the man that hath polluted this holy place</hi> (Acts 21.28.) Much more may it be urged upon Goſpel-profeſſors, what! commit ſuch a ſin as this? what! pollute the Temple of God? <hi>Know ye not</hi> (which every beleever is bound to know) <hi>that your body is the Temple of the Holy-Ghoſt as well as the ſoule.</hi> The laſt argument concludes the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, and is proſecuted in the 20 h; <hi>Ye are not your owne, for ye are bought with a price, therefore glorifie God in your body, and in your ſpirit which are Gods.</hi> Redemption is a ſtrong engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>ye are bought,</hi> and dearely payd for, <hi>ye are bought with a price, ye are not your owne.</hi> Some (who take liberty in this ſin) would excuſe themſelves by the contrary argument. <hi>Our bodyes</hi> (ſay they) <hi>are our owne, and we may doe what we will with our owne.</hi> No, ſayth the Apoſtle, <hi>ye are bought with a price, ye are not your owne;</hi> ye have your bodies of God, in their natural conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>It is he who hath made us</hi> (in that capacity) <hi>and not we our ſelves</hi> (Pſal. 100.3.) <hi>and ye are not your owne;</hi> for ye are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed or bought with a price, both body and ſoule. Yee are bought out of your owne hands, as well as out of the hand of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine juſtice and diſpleaſure. The Apoſtle ſpeaks eſpecially to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; For though it be a truth concerning all, whether beleevers, or unbeleevers, that <hi>they are not their owne,</hi> none of the ſons of men are their owne, God hath a right to them by creation, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by his continuall providence, proviſion, and preſervation, yet beleevers or the redeemed in a ſpeciall manner, <hi>are not their owne,</hi> and therefore they ought above others to <hi>glorifie God in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and in their ſpirit which are Gods.</hi> Having thus opened ſeveral Scripture grounds and arguments to demonſtrate the ſoulenes and filthines of this ſin of Adultery, which is the generall ſubject of this verſe; I ſhall now proceed in the expoſition of particulars in it.</p>

                  <p>The word, <hi>alſo,</hi> referres to the murderer ſpoken of in the former verſe; implying, that the Adulterer and he, though their ſins are very different, yet agree much in taking their opportunities of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. How contrary ſoever ſinners are in their particular practice, yet they have all one common principle and Spirit. The Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:153845:305"/> and the Adulterer are alike deſierous of privacy. They both love darkenes rather then light, or that which is neyther, <hi>Twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.

                     <hi>The eye alſo of the adulterer waiteth,</hi> that is, <hi>the adulterer himſelfe waiteth. Job</hi> doth not ſay, the <hi>Adulterer waiteth,</hi> but <hi>the eye of the Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer waiteth,</hi> becauſe the eye is much in adultery; The eye hath ſo great a ſhare in that ſin,<note place="margin">In re amatoria oculi ſunt leno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, prima amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris via. <hi>Lucian:</hi> Amoris princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium. <hi>Plato.</hi> Amoris ſedes. <hi>Philoſtr:</hi> Nihil in oculis eſt quod non ſit laſcivum &amp; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulans, nihil in oculorum pupilla in eſſe dicas, quam amicam, cum potiri non poſſunt, ſaltem conſpectu ſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunt.</note> that the whole ſin is here charged upon the eye. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14.) ſpeakes of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of evill men, <hi>having their eyes full of adultery,</hi> or (as the Greeke Original hath it with much Emphaſis) <hi>full of an Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> As if he had ſayd; they are perſons ſo given up to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanenes, that they have no deſire to ſee any body with their eyes but an Adultereſſe, nor is any thing elſe to be ſeene in their eyes but Adultery. They are as impudent as they are uncleane, letting out the Adultery which is in their hearts at their eyes, not caring who ſees it. Adultery is ſeated in the heart, there's the fountaine of it (<hi>Math.</hi> 15.19.) <hi>Out of the heart proceed evill thoughts, murthers, adulteries, fornications, thefts, falſe witneſſe, blaſphemy;</hi> Adultery comes out of the heart, but 'tis firſt ſeene in the eye, yea the eye often gives the firſt occaſion of it to the heart. (<hi>Math.</hi> 5.28.) <hi>Whoſoever looketh upon a woman to luſt after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.</hi> Wanton love uſually aſcends by theſe five ſteps: Firſt, the eye ſees; ſecondly, the heart deſires; thirdly, the thoughts are plotting and contriving how to attaine what is deſiered; fourthly, there is hope to attaine what is plotted, and, fifthly, there is joy and delight in the attaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what was hoped. Thus uſually the eye gives the occaſion and leads the dance in all the meetings of vanity. The Ancient Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſt (in his booke <hi>of the long-comming revenges of God</hi>) makes report that one <hi>Apollidorus</hi> being in a dreame ſaw his owne skin pull'd off by a barbarous Scythian,<note place="margin">Plutarchus de ſera numinis vindicta.</note> who then preſently threw him into a chaldron of boileing water, where being tormented his heart whiſpered to him, <hi>I am the cauſe of all this.</hi> The heart is the cauſe of puniſhment and miſery, remotely, becauſe nextly it is the cauſe of ſin, eſpecially of this ſin of Adultery, yet as the heart doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſet the eye a worke to finde out objects, ſo the eye meeting with objects ſets the heart aworke, yea it ſets the heart a fire, or all in a flame with vaine deſires and adulterous luſtings. The eyes
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:153845:305"/> of ſome looke out continually for the fuel of thoſe ſecret fires, and the eyes of others meete with it unlooked for. A good mans eye may meete with a vaine object, but his eye doth not goe out to ſeeke or waite for it. Againſt ſuch active wickednes <hi>Job</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed while he ſayd (<hi>Chap.</hi> 31.1.) <hi>I have made a covenant with mine eyes,</hi> &amp;c. A godly mans eye hath ſomewhat elſe to waite upon, then ſuch enſnaring objects. And the Pſalmiſt tells us upon what the Godly mans eye waites (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 123.2.) <hi>Behold as the eyes of ſervants looke unto the hand of their Maſters,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſo our eyes waite upon the Lord our God untill he have mercy upon us.</hi> The eye of a Godly man waiteth to receive Good, and the eye of a wicked man waiteth to doe evill. The Adulterer hath <hi>a waiteing eye,</hi> and this waiteing notes three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the Adulterer is very diligent, and intentive to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his purpoſe; he that waites is more then awake; He is not onely awake but watchfull; both theſe are put together (<hi>Pro.</hi> 8.34.) where the diligence of the Saints is ſpoken of in their waite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Chriſt in his appointments; <hi>Bleſſed is the man that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me, watching daily at my gates, waiteing at the poſts of my doores;</hi> they who waite at the poſts of wiſdome, that is, of Chriſt, <hi>watch alſo at his gates;</hi> they watch there, and they waite there. It is poſſible for a man to watch, as watching is onely oppoſed to ſleeping, &amp; yet not to waite, that is, not to be diligent or attentive upon any buſienes, but he that watcheth, as watching is oppoſed to Idling, he is alwayes waiting as long as watching, and he cannot but be watching, who is indeed waiting. Thus the Adulterer takes much paines to obtaine his forbidden pleaſures, his eye waiteth and watcheth, he is a diligent ſervant or ſlave rather to his luſt; every man that commits ſin, is a ſervant to ſin, and every ſervant muſt waite; it is the duty of a ſervant to waite for his Lord, the adulterer waites upon his luſt as upon his Lord, every luſt would be waited upon as a Lord. Saints watch at wiſedomes gates, and waite like ſervants at her poſts to know her pleaſure. Adulterers watch at whoredomes gates, and at her poſts they waite for ſinfull pleaſures.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To waite, implyeth the exerciſe of much patience; he that waiteth, expects long, he muſt expect and ſtay till the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity comes, <hi>Even the wicked have patience, upon hopes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment;</hi> And ſhall not the Godly? It may ſhame the Godly out
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:153845:306"/> of their impatience and loathnes to waite for an anſwer of prayer from God, when they heare that <hi>The husband-man waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, untill he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave the early and the latter raine</hi> (Jam: 5.7.) But it may ſhame them much more out of all their impatience in waiting for good things from God, when they heare that the Adulterer waiteth for the whoriſh woman, and hath long patience, till he receave his longing.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Waiteing implyeth the Adulterers fixedneſſe in and reſolvedneſſe to ſinne, <hi>his eye waiteth;</hi> he doth not ſin by a ſudden glance of his eye, or upon a vehement guſt of temptation, or upon an unthought of hurry of wanton paſſions, but he ſins deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and (as it were) in coole blood. He waiteth for and watcheth his ſeaſon, he is ſerious and ſtudious about his wickednes.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>A wicked man ſinnes with reſolution.</q>
                  <p>He that waiteth to doe any thing, hath a reſolution to doe it. A Godly man ſins, but he doth not waite to ſin; or if at any time he doe ſo, he at that time acts the wicked mans part in the godly mans ſtate, and ſo upon a ſtrong temptation Godly men have done. But uſually he is a wicked man (as to his ſtate) that waites for a temptation. Afflictions waite every where for a godly man (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake of himſelfe, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.23.) and ſo alſo doe Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. But the ungodly are every where waiteing for temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. They are not ſurpriſed, or taken unawares, by a ſin, but they are reſolved to take their firſt opportunity of ſinning. What a godly man ſayth (when he is in a right frame) in reference to the wayes of holynes (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 108.1.) <hi>O God my heart is prepared or fixed;</hi> A godly man doth not good upon a ſudden, or by chance (as we ſay) but he ſets himſelfe to it, his heart is fixed or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and his face is ſet heaven-ward, or for heavenly duties. So <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpake of himſelfe (<hi>Dan.</hi> 9.3.) <hi>I ſet my face unto the Lord God to ſeeke by prayer and ſupplications,</hi> and as a godly man is in the wayes of God, ſo the wayes of God are in him. Thus <hi>David</hi> deſcribes him (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.5.) <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe ſtrength is in thee, in whoſe heart are the wayes of them,</hi> that is, the wayes which Godly men walke in, and they are the wayes of God. Now as this is the true ſtate of godlineſſe when the heart is
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:153845:306"/> in it and prepared for it, ſo the true ſtate of wickedneſſe is, when a mans heart is in it and prepared for it. This is the proper cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a wicked man. <hi>The eye of the Adulterer waiteth for the twilight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every word hath weight in it, <hi>the twilight</hi> is the Adulterers ſeaſon; It is not ſayd, he waites for the night, or for the day, but he waiteth for the <hi>twilight,</hi> which is neither day nor night, but between both. We have ſuch a deſcription of time in reference to the mixt and uncertaine ſtate of things (<hi>Zach.</hi> 14.6, 7.) <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe in that day, that the light ſhall not be cleare nor darke; But it ſhall be one day which ſhall be knowne to the Lord, not day nor night.</hi> Such a thing is Twilight, it is neyther cleare nor darke, neyther day nor night, but between both. There is a twofold twilight; firſt, the morning twilight; and, ſecondly,<note place="margin">Diluculum. Crepuſculu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> the evening twilight; the morning twilight begins when the night ends, the evening twilight begins when the day ends. The Latines have two diſtinct words to expreſſe theſe diſtinct twilights by, but our language is not ſo well ſtored, and therefore we muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them by the matter ſpoken of, or the ſcope of the ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker. Thus here, when 'tis ſayd in the text, he <hi>waiteth for the twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,</hi> we are to underſtand it of the evening twilight, not for the morning twilight, and the reaſon is, becauſe the morning twilight is not for the adulterers turne or purpoſe, for then the light prevailes upon the darkneſs, but it is the evening twilight, for then darkneſs prevailes upon the light. And that this is the Adulterers twilight is cleare (<hi>Prov.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9.<note place="margin">Nox et tenebrae adminiſtrae ſunt impijs ſuarum libidinum. Ipſa nox alioquin cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca infandarum tamen libidinu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oculatus teſtis eſt.</note>) <hi>At the window of my houſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) I looked through the caſement, and behold among the ſimple ones, I diſcerned among the youths, a man voyd of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, paſſing by the way to her houſe, and he went neere her cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in the twilight in the evening</hi> (or) <hi>in the evening of the day, in the blacke and darke night. And behold there met him a woman with the attire of a harlot,</hi> &amp;c. His eye waited for the twilight, and in the twilight he was taken.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>The doing of evill hath its proper ſeaſons, as well as the doing of good.</q>
                  <p>Though ſin be never in ſeaſon, yet it hath ſome times which are
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:153845:307"/> more ſeaſonable for it; to ſin is never in ſeaſon, as to the lawfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of committing it, but ſin hath its ſeaſons as to the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of committing it. The Adulterer takes his ſeaſon, <hi>he waiteth for the twilight.</hi> Whence note ſecondly.</p>
                  <q>Evill men are very carefull to hit their ſeaſons for the doing of evill.</q>
                  <p>It were deſireable that the godly were as carefull to hit their ſeaſons, and take their times, as the ungodly are. <hi>To every thing</hi> (ſaith the Preacher, <hi>Eccl:</hi> 3.1.) <hi>there is a ſeaſon and a time for every purpoſe under the Sunne.</hi> And becauſe it is ſo (ſaith the ſame Preacher, <hi>Eccl:</hi> 8.6.) <hi>The miſery of man is great upon him.</hi> But why doth this make the miſery of man great upon him? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, The reaſon of this miſery upon man, is not becauſe there is a ſeaſon, but becauſe eyther of his ignorance or negligence to find it. There are a thouſand wayes to miſſe a ſeaſon, and but one to hit it; And were there as many wayes to hit as to miſſe, it were a thouſand to one but man would miſſe rather then hit; and therefore the miſery of man is great upon him, Becauſe if once he miſſe his ſeaſon, it cannot be recovered, and then he muſt needs be miſerable. Good men are miſerable (as to ſome caſes) becauſe they are often ſo careleſſe to hit their ſeaſon of doing good, and doe ſo often miſſe it, notwithſtanding all their care. Wicked men are for ever miſerable, becauſe they are ſo carefull not to miſſe their ſeaſon of doing evill, and doe ſo often hit it. The eye of the Adulterer waiteth for the twilight, and he ſeldome (as to his own end) waites in vaine. But why is he ſo greedy for the twilight? The next words ſay why, where he brought in
<q>Saying, no eye ſhall ſee me.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where ſayth he this? he ſayth it in his heart, this is his diſcourſe in his owne breaſt; and to whom ſayth he this? he ſayth it to himſelfe, there is a dialogue between the Adulterer and his owne heart, and thus he concludes, <hi>I will waite for the twilight, and then no eye ſhall ſee me.</hi> And when he ſayth, <hi>no eye ſhall ſee me,</hi> his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, There is not any eye that ſhall ſee me. Thus he playes the foole at <hi>All's hid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet further, this <hi>no eye</hi> may have a threefold reference.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, No eye of common men ſhall ſee me, I will doe this in
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:153845:307"/> ſecret, I will have ſuch a cover of darkneſſe over me, that my neighbours and friends ſhall not be able to take any notice of mee.</p>

It hath been obſerved alſo in antiquity, that great Princes had certaine men in office <hi>whom they called their eyes.</hi> Princes have their eyes and eares in every place, that is, their Officers.

<pb n="588" facs="tcp:153845:308"/> that eye (let others ſee what they will, and ſay what they pleaſe) I ſhall not ſuffer at all for what I doe; and then all's well, that's as much as I care for. And here we may note, That, As ſome Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers have their eyes abroad, that is, agents to eſpy out Beauties for them. So moſt of them (if not all) are afraid of the eyes of others.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>No eye ſhall ſee me,</hi> that is, not the eye of God; God himſelfe ſhall not ſee me. Thus the adulterer hopes to hide his ſin from his eye who is indeed all eye,<note place="margin">Homines latere cupiens Dei o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum non ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meus.</note> and whoſe eye is over all. Thus the adulterer ſuppoſeth himſelfe under ſuch a vayl of darknes, that he is free not onely from the eye of men on earth, and from the eye of thoſe who are gods upon earth, but even from the eye of the God of heaven.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, Note.</p>
                  <q>It is not the act of ſin, but the diſcovery of it which a wicked man feareth.</q>
                  <p>He cares not what wickedneſſe he doth, ſo he may goe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene; a godly man is afraid of doing evill, though he could doe it with greateſt ſecrecy, or under the darkeſt cover: he is afraid to doe evill, becauſe of the evill and unrighteouſneſſe of it, becauſe of the pollution, and unanſwerableneſſe of it, both to his owne duty, and the goodneſſe of God to him; but it is the diſcovery not the iniquity of his worke, which the hypocrite feareth.</p>

                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>That it is the puniſhment of ſin at which a wicked man is troubled, he is not troubled at the ſin it ſelfe.</q>
                  <p>'Tis the conſequence of ſin, not the nature of it, the ſmart of ſin, and not the filth of it, which the wicked would avoyd.</p>

                  <p>They thinke, ſure, God can ſee no further, nor no better then man; And ſo they have hopes to hide themſelves, not onely from the eyes of men, but from the eyes of God, as we may ſee plainly (<hi>Jere.</hi> 23.23.) <hi>Can any hide himſelfe in ſecret places, that I ſhall not ſee him, ſaith the Lord;</hi> This queſtion, <hi>can any?</hi> ſhews that ſome had flattered themſelves into ſuch a concluſion, that they could ſo hide themſelves in ſecret places, that God could not ſee them. The holy Pſalmiſt ſayd (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.12.) <hi>The darkneſſe hideth not from thee, but the night ſhineth as the day, the darkneſſe and the light to thee are both alike.</hi> But a wicked man ſayth, the darkneſſe hideth from thee, the night is night to thee. O what beggerly apprehenſions have men of God! As if he whoſe eyes are ten thouſand times brighter then the Sunne, could not ſee without Sunlight, or as if he could not ſee but in the light, who made the light.<note place="margin">Vanus eſt qui purat ſe in tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris eſſe tutum, cum lucem vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare non poſſit, quae lucet in te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebris &amp; tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae eam non comprehende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt. <hi>Ambroſ:</hi>

                  <q>And he diſguiſeth his face.</q>
                  <p>The Hebrew is, <hi>He ſetteth his face into a ſecret;</hi> he muffles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he changeth his habit, he puts on a viſard; harlots were wont to diſguiſe themſelves (<hi>Gen.</hi> 39.14.) when <hi>Tamar</hi> tooke upon her the habit of an harlot, the Text ſaith, <hi>She put on a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe;</hi> ſo here the Adulterer puts on a diſguiſe, he puts a cozzen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing face upon his face, and then thinkes, that though he be ſeene,
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:153845:309"/> yet he cannot be diſcerned, and that, though ſome may ſee where he is, yet none ſhall ſee who he is, <hi>He diſguiſeth his face.</hi> One would have thought that being in the twilight, and the darkenes of the night ready to compaſſe him about, that no eye could ſee him, he ſhould not need to have put on a viſard or a muffler, yet he doth ſo, he puts a diſguiſe upon his face.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>When a mans conſcience tells him he ſins, he would not have any other tell him ſo too. The Adulterer feares twilight is too light for him, and therefore while the naturall darkenes is ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, he puts his face into perfect artificiall darkenes. <hi>Job</hi> yet proceeds to ſhew this cowardly temper of ſinners in their feare to be ſeene, eyther by a further diſcovery of the ſame ſort of ſinners, or of another ſort, in the ſame frame.</p>

                     </note> they have digged through houſes to make private paſſages that they might not be diſcovered when they came to, or when they departed from their lovers. It hath been commonly ſayd that hunger will break through ſtone walls, and 'tis a truth that wantonnes will doe ſo too. Some have been ſo mad upon their luſts, that if they could not finde a way, they would make one to meete with their paramours.

                     </note> though it be true, that Adulterers doe ſometimes digge through houſes, yet this is both more frequently and more properly the buſienes of Theeves. Another reaſon to perſwade this underſtanding of the preſent Text may be, becauſe ſo we have a fuller and more particular enumeration of ſeveral ſorts of ſin and ſinners.</p>
                  <q>In the darke they dig through houſes.</q>
                  <p>To dig through houſes, is the worke of a theife. And thus Chriſt ſpeakes of the theife (<hi>Luk.</hi> 12.39.) <hi>And this know that if the good man of the houſe had knowne what houre the theife would have come, he would have watched, and not have ſuffered his houſe to have been broken through. Jacob</hi> ſayth of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi (Gen.</hi> 49.6.) <hi>In their anger they digged thorow a wall.</hi> Some breake thorow walls for want, or in covetouſneſſe to rob and ſteale, others for anger and in wrath to kill and deſtroy. <hi>They dig thorow houſes,</hi>
                     <q>Which they had marked for themſelves in the day time.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>See the method and cunning of theſe robbers; here are three poynts of their ſinfull skill. Firſt; <hi>they marke houſes;</hi> the word ſignifies, <hi>to marke with a ſeale;</hi> as if they did put their ſeale upon other mens houſes for their owne uſe. Theeves goe abroad in the day time to eſpy where they may commit a robbery with beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and they ſet their marke upon ſuch houſes as they reſolve to rob; or, which I rather take to be the meaning, they diligently obſerve the ſtrength of the houſe, the wayes to the houſe, what company is in the houſe, where they may with moſt eaſe and advantage breake into the houſe. All this they doe in the day by way of preparation, and in the darke they put their purpoſes into execution; <hi>In the darke they digge through houſes which they had marked in the day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>Sinners would make ſure worke, they would not miſſe.</q>
                  <p>And therefore they eyther ſet their marke upon a houſe, or exactly marke it. O how witty, and how cunning men are to doe miſchiefe!</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whereas they went from Towne to Towne, and
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:153845:310"/> any houſe they ſaw and liked, they marked it for themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Learne.</p>
                  <q>An unjuſt perſon makes every thing his owne, if he can come by it, if he can but get it.</q>
                  <p>He ſayth of another mans houſe, this is mine, I will fill my own houſe with the ſpoyle and plunder of this.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The theife marked houſes
<q>In the day time.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He digged through them in the night, but he made uſe of the day; he would not breake open a houſe in the day, but had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to doe towards the breaking open of a houſe in the day, he marked it in the day.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>That time which ſuites not one wicked purpoſe, may ſuite another.</q>
                  <p>The theife makes uſe of all times, he makes uſe of the day to marke houſes, and of the night to digge them through. He is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to take his time; to doe the worke of the day upon the day, and the worke of the night, in the night.</p>
                  <q>They know not the light.</q>
                  <p>But why doth <hi>Job</hi> adde this? ſayd he not before, that they marked houſes for themſelves in the day? How then doth he ſay,
<q>They know not the light.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Knowing is not meant of a bare act of knowledge, as if they knew not when it was light, and when it was darke, or as if they knew not the nature of light, what kinde of creature it is. But, <hi>not to know,</hi> is not to affect; <hi>They know not the light,</hi> that is, they care not, they love not the light. In which ſence words of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge are often uſed in Scripture.

<pb n="593" facs="tcp:153845:310"/> light. But it may be objected; It ſhould ſeeme theſe men cared for the light, and liked it well, for they made much uſe of it; <hi>In the day they marked houſes.</hi> I anſwer, When <hi>Job</hi> ſayth, <hi>They know not the light,</hi> we may reſtraine it to one part of their buſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and that the maine, <hi>Their digging through houſes;</hi> for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (which was their principall purpoſe) <hi>they knew not the light,</hi> that is, they neyther loved nor liked the light, darkenes was more welcome to them. I ſhall not give any notes from theſe words here, having before (eſpecially at the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, where it is ſayd, <hi>They are ſuch as rebel againſt the light, they know not the wayes of it,</hi> &amp;c.) been ſomewhat large upon the ſame ſubject; As alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the next verſe is but a further illuſtration and enforcement of theſe words.</p>

What is the reaſon of it, why doth the adulterer feare the morning, and why doth the theife feare the morning? they doe ſo upon theſe three conſiderations.</p>

                  <q>That good things even the beſt things are a trouble to wicked men.</q>
                  <p>Sin makes good things evill to us, and pleaſant things trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to us. What a pleaſant thing is the light? How beautifull
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:153845:311"/> are the eyelids of the morning? yet light is a trouble, and the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a burden to wicked men. And if natural light be a trouble to them, much more is moral and ſpirituall light. How doe they hate the morning of truth, the dawnings of divine knowledge? Theſe lights to life, theſe enlivening lights are to them as the ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death. In how deplorable a condition are they to whom Good becomes evill, and that which good men rejoyce in, is to them an occaſion of ſorrow. The whole courſe of nature is out of frame to us, till we are ſet into a right frame by grace. We put light for darkenes and darkenes for light, till we our ſelves are brought out of darkenes into light. Nothing is good to us till we are made good, nor doth any thing pleaſe us, except ſin or that which we uſe ſinfully, till we pleaſe God.

So this phraſe is uſed (<hi>Ruth</hi> 3.14.) <hi>And ſhee lay at his feete untill the morning, and ſhe roſe up before one could know another,</hi> that is, before there was light enough to diſcerne each other.

(<hi>Judg.</hi> 9.9.15.) <hi>Come truſt under my ſhadow</hi> (ſayd the bramble) that is, put your ſelves under my protection. And againe (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.2, 3.) <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall the ſtrength of Pharaoh be your ſhame, and the truſt in the ſhaddow</hi> (or protection) <hi>of Aegypt your confuſion.</hi> So (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.2.) <hi>In the ſhadow of his hand hath he hid me.</hi> And (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.16.) <hi>I have covered thee in the ſhadow of my hand,</hi> as birds cover or ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their young ones with their wings and feathers. Thus the Scripture ſpeakes of a ſhadow. But what is the ſhadow of death? It is firſt, the appearance of death; ſecondly, the power of death. So the the meaning is (as was touched before) they are as much terrified, as if death appeared to them, as if the image of death paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before them in viſion, or as if the power of it had taken hold of them to bring them priſoners to the grave.</p>
                  <q>If one know them, they are in the terrour of the ſhadow of death.</q>
                  <p>I have from the former words of this context, as alſo at the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe taken occaſion to obſerve, how troubleſome both the light of the Sunne and the light of the minde are to evill men, and therefore I ſhall not ſtay upon any Inſtructions of that kinde here.</p>
                  <p>Yet foraſmuch as not onely the Murderer and Adulterer, ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of before, but the Theife ſpoken of here, are all for darkenes and concealement.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That ſinners have a ſecret conviction upon themſelves, that what they doe is not good.</q>
                  <p>They draw up their own enditement, and condemne themſelves before God doth. They would rocke conſcience aſleepe, but they cannot, they would blind it, but they cannot. This their delight in
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:153845:312"/> darkneſſe, both outward and inward, is a plaine demonſtration that they know their deedes are evill. Chriſt ſayth as much (<hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20, 21.) <hi>Every one that doth evill hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved.</hi> No man feares his deeds will be reproved, but he that ſuſpects at leaſt, that his deeds are his faults, and his actings his tranſgreſſings; for as it followes, <hi>He that doth truth</hi> (that is, who acts according to the truth) <hi>cometh to the light.</hi> He that doth good, or truth indeed, yea he who is but perſwaded that he doth ſo, cares not who ſees him; ſome are am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious to be ſeene while they doe ſo, and though any ſhould be ſo modeſt that they doe not deſire to be ſeene while they doe ſo, yet no man that doth ſo is affrayd to be ſeene; and uſually ſuch come to the light, to the light of other mens knowledge, and they would come further into the light of their own knowledg; ſuch are free to <hi>come to light of all ſorts, that their deeds may be made manifeſt, that they are wrought in God;</hi> when a man comes to the light, he gives a fayre evidence that his workes are wrought in God, how ever it argues both that he deſires they ſhould be ſuch as are wrought in God, as alſo that he is willing they ſhould come to the tryall, whether they are wrought in God or no, that is, whether they be ſo wrought, as if God did worke in him, or whether there be any appearance in them that he hath wrought them in the light and love, in the ſtrength and helpe of God. Now as when a man comes willingly to the light, it ſhewes that he hath an honeſt perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in his breaſt, that his workes are good. So when we ſee any ſeeking corners and ſhunning the light by which others may ſee them, or that light by which they may ſee themſelves, this ſhews that they have a troubleſome conviction upon their conſciences, that their workes are ſo farre from being wrought in God, that they are wrought againſt God, that is, againſt his mind and will. This, the Apoſtle teacheth in the example of the old Gentiles (<hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15.) <hi>They ſhew the worke of the Law written in their hearts, their conſcience bearing them witneſſe, and their thoughts in the meane while accuſing or excuſing one another.</hi> Were there not an unextinguiſhable light in nature, by which even a natural man may have ſome glimmerings of and diſcernings between good and evill, he would no more avoyd the ſight of others when he doth evill, then when he doth good. And ſeeing he thus naturally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voydes the view and ſight of all men when he doth evill; This
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:153845:312"/> doth more then intimate that there is a Judge above nature, who, <hi>without reſpect of perſons, will reward every man according to his workes.</hi> Conſcience is Gods Deputy in man, and what that (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rightly enformed) doth in man, God will doe too. Wee are ſo aſſured by the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.21.) <hi>If our heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne us, God is greater then our heart, and knoweth all things;</hi> As if he had ſayd, this is an argument that there is a God to condemn, becauſe the heart condemnes; <hi>For God is greater then the heart.</hi> God is the ſupreame Judge, the infallible Judge, the heart is but an under-officer unto him. Why ſhould the heart of a man ſmite him? why ſhould he be troubled when he hath done evill? why ſhould he be ſo troubled to be ſeene in doing evill? were it not that there is a God, who judgeth both the hearts and wayes of men; While <hi>the foole ſaith in his heart there is no God,</hi> (Pſal. 14.1.) the heart of a foole ſayth there is a God: while he ſaith in his heart there is no God to ſee my ſin, his heart ſaith to him, cover thy ſin, that it may not be ſeene; and what Engliſh can we make of this ſaying of his heart, but this, There is a God. For though <hi>Job</hi> ſpake here of ſuch groſſe ſinners as have reaſon enough to hide themſelves and their doings from the eyes of men, leſt they ſhould bring them both to ſhame and puniſhment, yet even thoſe ſinners are fearefull to have their ſins diſcovered, who need not feare any puniſhment but from the hand of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>Sin befools the ſinner, or ſinners are very fooliſh.</q>
                  <p>They are glad if they can eſcape the eye of man, when as their ſins are alwayes under the eye of God. What is the eye from which darkneſſe can hide us, to that eye which ſeeth through darkenes? <hi>If one ſee them</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>they are in the terrors of the ſhadow of death,</hi> and yet they are not terrifyed that <hi>One</hi> ſeeth them. <hi>That One</hi> ſeeth them alwayes who is more then all men, and yet they are ſatisfyed if they are not ſeene of men. That which they would not doe if a little childe did ſee them, they dare doe though the Great God of heaven and earth ſee them. What the Prophet ſpeakes of feare in reference to ſuffering, wee may ſay much more of feare in reference to ſinning, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.12, 13.) <hi>Who art thou, that thou ſhouldſt be afraid of a man that ſhall dye, and forgetteſt the Lord thy Creator? Who art thou?</hi> ſurely thou
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:153845:313"/> art ſo far from being a Godly man, that thou art leſſe then a man, in this thing, even a foole, and a beaſt. What? doeſt thou feare to ſin in the preſence of a man, or when a man, who ſhall dye ſeeth thee, and forgetteſt that the Lord thy maker ſeeth thee? that he ſeeth thee <hi>who hath ſtretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth.</hi> Well might the Apoſtle (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.2.) joyne theſe two together, <hi>unreaſonable and wicked men,</hi> and give the reaſon of both in the words which follow, <hi>for all men have not faith.</hi> Where there is no faith, there is much wickedneſſe, and he who is much in wickedneſſe, is nothing in reaſon. Faith is above reaſon, but not againſt it; wickedneſſe is not onely below reaſon, but quite againſt it. They who act againſt that rule which is given by God to man, act alſo againſt that reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is given by God to man. No man acts ſo much againſt faith, as he who doth not beleeve that God ſeeth him in all his actings, nor doth any man act more againſt reaſon, then he who beleeveth that God ſeeth him, and yet is more afraid to be ſeene of men, then he is to be ſeene of God.</p>

                  <p>THere are foure Apprehenſions concerning the general ſcope of theſe words.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Job</hi> is conceived here deſcribing a fourth ſort of wicked men, or the ſame men acting a fourth ſort of wickednes; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (as hath been ſhewed from the former words) firſt drawne out the doings of the murtherer, and ſecondly, of the Adulterer, and thirdly, of the theife at land digging through houſes, he in the fourth place (as ſome Interpret the text) proceeds to diſcover the Pyrate, who is a theife upon the water, a Sea-theife; <hi>He is ſwift as the waters,</hi> or, <hi>he is ſwift upon the waters:</hi> The letter of the Hebrew, is, <hi>He is ſwift upon the faces of the waters,</hi> he moves in, and upon all waters. It is uſuall in Scripture to call the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part of any thing, the face of it, as the face of the heavens, is that part of the heavens which doth outwardly appeare to us, or is next to our eye. <hi>O ye hypocrites</hi> (ſayth Chriſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 16.3.) <hi>ye can diſcerne the face of the skie.</hi> So the face of the earth is the ſuperficies, or upper part of the earth, and the face of the waters, is the upper part of the waters. The word in the text is plural, <hi>faces, he is ſwift upon the faces of the water;</hi> that is, when he hath murtherd, committed Adultery, and robbed at land, when the Earth is weary of him, then he betakes himſelfe to the Sea, and turnes Pyrate. There is a truth in this,<note place="margin">Velocitêr man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> ſome men make ſuch a progreſſe in wickedneſſe; they try all trades of ſin upon the earth, and then trade ſinfully upon the water, defileing both earth and water, both ſea and ſhoare, polluting all the Elements with their abominations. And in purſuance of this expoſition the two other Clauſes of the verſe are thus expounded, <hi>Their portion is Curſed in the earth,</hi> that is, they who live at land Curſe them when they are gone to Sea, fearing leſt they ſhould take their ſhips, &amp; ſpoyl them of their goods by pyracy. And then, <hi>he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards,</hi> that is, he will come no more on ſhoare, he will not live at land: vineyards by a ſynecdoche of the part for the whole
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:153845:314"/> being put for any kinde of home or land poſſeſſion, of which vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards (in many places) are the chiefe; he who lived by dreſſing and planting the earth, now takes another courſe of life, <hi>hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth not the way of the vineyards;</hi> he will labour no more in a Country life, he will not get his liveing by the ſweat of his face, but by the face of the waters. What cares he to get wine by dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of vineyards, when he can get whole Shiploads of wine upon the waters. And having got a ſmatch of the ſweetnes of robbing at Sea, he will worke no more aland. We have too much experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it, that when a man hath once given himſelfe up to ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he cannot abide labouring. He is better pleaſed with an eaſie life that is ſinfull, then with an honeſt life that is painefull; and becauſe eaſe pleaſeth him more then honeſty, therefore <hi>he will not behold the way of the vineyards,</hi> nor the way of the Corne feilds, nor of the paſture grounds,<note place="margin">Ad piratas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre divinare eſt ex proprio cerebro, cum hic tantum de infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </note> for all theſe are wayes of labour. But I ſhall not Inſiſt upon this Interpretation, it may ſuffice onely to name it. And though, as to the thing it ſelfe, as alſo to the practice of many, this be a truth, yet it is ſcarſely probable, that <hi>Job</hi> had that practice in his eye.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Wee may here conceave, that <hi>Job</hi> is deſcribing the miſerable and unſetled Condition of the murtherer, of the Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, and of the Theife; <hi>hee is ſwift upon the waters,</hi> or, <hi>ſwift as the waters</hi> (ſay wee) M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Broughton</hi> renders, <hi>He is lighter then the face of the waters.</hi> The Hebrew particle ſerves eyther reading, <hi>as,</hi> or upon; <hi>He is ſwift, or light upon the face of the waters,</hi> that is, he is as a light thing that ſwimmeth upon the face of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; light things ſwim there, things which are of no worth, of no price, as ſtrawes, or chips, or feathers, or the foame (which is light and hoven) ſwim upon the face of the water. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Broughton</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlates thus; <hi>He is lighter then the face of the waters.</hi> The ſence is the ſame, for as thoſe things which ſwim upon the face of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are light, ſo alſo is the face of the waters. Every blaſt or puffe of winde moves and toſſeth up the face of the waters.</p>
                  <q>
                     <note place="margin">Levitas pro ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locitate ſumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, leve enim facile movetur &amp; quod facile movetur velox eſt.</note>He is ſwift, <hi>or,</hi> light upon the face of the waters.</q>
                  <p>The Hebrew word which we render, <hi>ſwift,</hi> in our tranſlation ſignifieth alſo <hi>light;</hi> becauſe thoſe things that are ſwift in moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are light; wee ſay of one that is ſlow paced, hee is heavie heel'd, and that he is a heavy man or that a heavy beaſt which
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:153845:314"/> is ſlow of foot; all ſwift things are light. The meaning of this Interpretation is, that a wicked man is a Contemptible Creature; what is hee when he hath done all thoſe miſchiefes before ſpecify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and walked to wearynes in all thoſe ſinfull wayes?<note place="margin">Proverbialis lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quutio ad expri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendum aliquid quod flocci pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur &amp; fere nihil eſt. <hi>Bold.</hi> Leves erunt ut res quae ſuper aquas natant, fluctuabunt abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant, diffluent.</note> The beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which we can give of him is this; <hi>Hee is light, or as a light thing, upon the face of the water;</hi> which is a Proverbiall ſpeech to Expreſſe that which is nothing worth. Thus the deſtruction of the King of <hi>Samaria</hi> is expreſſed (<hi>Hoſ:</hi> 10.7.) <hi>As for Samaria, her King is cut off as the foame upon the water,</hi> or (as the Margin hath it) <hi>upon the face of the water,</hi> that is, though he be a great King, yet he ſhall periſh as a very light, and contemptible thing, even as a little foame and froth, or as a buble upon the water.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>Wickednes makes men Contemptible and vile, they are but as light things upon the water.</q>
                  <p>In the 21<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of this booke (<hi>v.</hi> 18.) the wicked are ſayd to be <hi>as ſtubble before the fire, and as Chaff before the whirle-winde.</hi> So (<hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Pſal. 1.4.) ſpeaking of the wicked in general, ſaith, <hi>They are like the chaffe which the wind driveth away.</hi> Stubble and chaffe are light things, and they are alſo worthles things; what's the ſtubble worth, or what the chaffe? What is the chaffe to the wheat? ſuch are wicked men in compariſon of the Godly. The Scripture doth even ſtrive for Expreſſions (as I may ſay) to ſet forth the lightnes, the vanity, Indeed, the nullity, the non-entity, the nothingnes of men given up to their luſts. <hi>David</hi> (Pſal. 62.9.) ſpeaking of them <hi>who truſt in oppreſſion, and become vaine in robberie,</hi> ſaith, <hi>they are vanity and a lye, and that to be layd in the ballance, they are alltogether lighter then vanity.</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the tongue of a Godly man, and the heart of a wicked man together into the ballance, gives this determination between them (<hi>Pro.</hi> 10.20.) <hi>The tongue of the juſt is as choyce ſilver, but the heart of the wicked is little worth.</hi> The heart is there taken in the higheſt ſence, for the beſt thing that the wicked man hath; for though where the heart is nought, it is the worſt thing that a man hath, yet the ſence of the proverbe is to ſhew that the beſt thing that a wicked man hath is of little worth, and therefore the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is made in that which he accounts his chiefeſt treaſure, his heart; for by the heart, all that man hath within him, all the
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:153845:315"/> powers and faculties of the ſoule, with their beſt and richeſt furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are underſtood; all theſe ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi> in a wicked man are little worth; ſo that take him at his beſt, and in his beſt, he is but traſh, or as a trifle. Sin is a reproach both to perſons and nations, as honour is a mans weight in the eſteeme of others, ſo reproach abates his weight, &amp; makes him light upon the balance. <hi>Since thou waſt precious in mine eyes, thou waſt honourable,</hi> ſaith God (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.4.) holynes adds honour and weight to our perſons; ſin makes us light, and then we are lighteſt, when we make light of ſin; ſin is a weight that preſſeth us downe, yet they who ſin moſt, weigh leaſt in the eſteeme of God and of all good men. Sin will quickly ſinke the ſoule like lead under water, even to the bottome of the water, yet the ſinner is as a light thing that ſwims upon the top or face of the water. This is a profitable ſence of the words.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Others expound theſe words, as a deſcription of the wicked mans ſhifting and running from place to place for feare of purſuers; or that being conſcious to himſelfe; or ſelfe-condemned in his owne conſcience, he is as the Lord threatned <hi>Cain</hi> (Gen. 4.14.) <hi>a fugitive and a vagabond upon the earth:</hi> ſwift as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a ſtreame, which glide along and never ſtay in one place; or he is upon the earth as a light thing upon the waters, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally moved and toſſed up and downe. But I paſſe from this. And conclude</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That wee may rather underſtand theſe words as a deſcription of the ſpirit and temper of a wicked man in reference to his ſinfull actings, or the fulfilling of his luſts; <hi>Hee is ſwift or light as the water,</hi> or, <hi>as the light things upon the water,</hi> that is, hee is a man very unſetled, he is hurryed to and fro, there is no ſtability eyther in his wayes, or in his ſpirit; He abides not in one place, nor doth he abide in one minde. He is full of Inconſtancy, he is conſtant in nothing but in his unconſtancy: and it muſt needs be ſo if we Conſider,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, his luſts within. How can he but be ſwift as the water, who hath ſuch windes blowing and ſtriving in him. A carnal man is hurryed with ſtormes and tempeſts riſing in his owne minde: as the winde toſſeth and rolleth the waters of the Sea or light things upon the water, ſo the luſts of evill men toſs and tumble them up and downe. Pride toſſeth ſome, and Covetouſneſſe toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth others, luxury and wantonnes toſſe thouſands into a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:153845:315"/> vanities, and ſinful wayes, as the windes toſſe the waves of the Sea; Luſts are ſtrong and boyſterous, luſts are many and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, he that ſerveth any one of them is a ſlave to them all, and muſt goe upon their errand whetherſoever they will ſend or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hurry him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Carnal men muſt needs be ſwift as the water, or light upon the water, very unconſtant and unſetled if we Conſider the temptations that blow upon them from without. For though our owne luſts are temptations, and <hi>every man</hi> (as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith, Chapter 1.14.) <hi>is tempted when he is drawne away of his owne luſt, and enticed,</hi> yet our luſts alſo are tempted, or our luſts are drawne away and enticed by temptation. Man is apt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſin of himſelfe alone, if once God leave him, but he is ſeldome left to himſelfe alone to ſin by the Devill; and moſt uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally he is tempted with a kinde of violence unto ſinne; his luſts (which are a fire) are blowne and kindled by Satans breath, and he is driven to doe evill by vehement blaſts of temptation. Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions blow upon Saints, they blow ſtrongly upon them; Satan breathes out a mighty wind to make them ſwift as the water unto ſin; but they have received a power to reſiſt and ſtand faſt. They are founded upon the rocke Jeſus Chriſt; Though the winde moves the water, yet it cannot move the rock: they that are founded upon Chriſt, are (in their proporion) firme as Chriſt himſelfe is firme. 'Tis true, Saints are many times grievouſly ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with temptations; but the wicked are toſſed and overwhelmed by them. They are ſwift as the water, or as the lighteſt thing upon the face of the waters, when ſtrongly moved by temptation. Dying <hi>Jacob</hi> called <hi>Reuben,</hi> his firſt-borne, <hi>unſtable as water</hi> (Gen. 49.4.) though wee will not number him among the wicked, yet hee did a very wicked act, and in reference to that, though he was a great man, and a Patriarke, the head of the Tribe, yet (in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to that act) he received this Character, <hi>unſtable as water.</hi> And if he was ſo unſtable when hurryed by paſſion and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how much more are meer wicked men ſo, when they meet with ſuch temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. For as they are not fixed in any thing that is good, as was touched at the 13<hi rend="sup">•h</hi> verſe, <hi>They know not the wayes of light, nor doe they abide in the pathes of it</hi> (if at any time they ſtumble upon the doing of that which is right, yet they abide not in the doing of it; they are light as the water, unſtable and unſetled in
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:153845:316"/> all good wayes) So though they are fixed (as to the ſubject) in doing that which is evill, yet they are extreamly toſſed and ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moved, both to and in and after the doing of it.</p>
                  <p>Againe, As this ſimilitude implyes The eaſines of evill men to be moved by temptation unto ſinne, even as eaſily as water, or the lighteſt things upon the face of the water are moved by the winde. So it implyeth alſo their ſpeedyneſs and activity in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The water moves ſwiftly, ſinners are like ſwift ſhips upon the water, they make ſpeed to doe evill, or to trade upon any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden coaſt, but they are very ſluggs to any thing that is good, or to trade upon any coaſt where they are bidden. A learned In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter inſiſts much upon the emphaſis of this Expreſſion, to ſhew not onely the ſwiftnes, but the feircenes of a wicked mans ſpirit in ſinning, hee is ſwift upon the face of thoſe waters, and is carryed on with full ſayles in ſinning; hee runs ſo ſwiftly and treads ſo lightly, that he might run even upon the ſurface of the water and not ſinke. Thoſe creatures which are very ſwift, leave little Impreſſion behinde them; they that goe ſlowly, tread hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and unleſſe they be upon firme land, fall in. It is ſayd in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi> (v. 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>) Concerning the <hi>hee-goate</hi> (who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great) That <hi>he touched not the ground. Alexander</hi> was extreame ſwift in his Conqueſts, hee Conquered the world in as little time as another could have traveld over it. His motto was, <hi>Without delay;</hi> or, <hi>I doe all by making no delay;</hi> He was ſwift upon the face of the earth.<note place="margin">De facilitate peccandi at<expan>

Some are curſed by men, and yet God bleſſeth them, others are bleſſed or highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed by men, yet God curſeth them.

                  <p>Againe, Theſe words may be read by way of Imprecation (wee read them by way of aſſertion) <hi>let their portion be curſed in the earth;</hi> Like that (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.8, 9, 10, 11.) <hi>Let his dayes be few, and let another take his office, let his children be fatherleſſe, &amp;c.</hi>

For as the earth feeds the root, ſo the roote feeds the ſtocke, and the ſtocke the branches. That is a curſed tree which beares no fruit accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  </p>
                  <p>There is yet another Interpretation of theſe words, which I ſhall but briefely touch and paſſe on. <hi>Their portion is Curſed in the Earth,</hi> that is, the Region, or place where they dwell is Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; They dwell in deſolate places, or they skulke up and downe in deſerts and wilderneſſes, having done ſo much miſchiefe among men that they dare not ſhew their faces where they are knowne. Now, deſerts and deſolate places may juſtly be called Curſed pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, becauſe of their barrennes, for barrennes is the Curſe which God laid upon the earth for the ſin of man (<hi>Gen.</hi> 4.17.) As a fruitfull Land may be called a bleſſed Land, becauſe the bleſſing of God maketh a Land fruitfull (<hi>Iſaac</hi> ſaid to his Son <hi>Jacob (Gen.</hi> 27.27.) <hi>The ſmell of my Son is as the ſmell of a field which the Lord hath bleſſed;</hi> that is, as the ſmel of a fruitfull feild) So it may be ſayd that the earth or land where a man lives,<note place="margin">Deſcribit quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo ſeſe gerere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoleant: ut ſuae maleficia co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius tegant eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt ſibi ſed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> and his portion in it is curſed while he lives in a barren deſolate land, which looks as if it were under the perpetuall curſe of God. And according to this interpretation, the later part of the verſe <hi>(and he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards)</hi> may be thus underſtood; He comes not into any fruitfull fields; Vineyards are planted in a fruitfull ſoyle, and fruitfull vines are full of the bleſſing of God. Thus as the portion of the wicked in the earth is alwayes curſed, by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree from God, ſo it may be ſayd that their portion is ſometimes curſed by their owne Election, becauſe for the better ſecreting and hiding of themſelves from the eye of Juſtice, they ſpend their dayes in ſuch places as by reaſon of their waſtnes, and barrennes ſeeme to confeſſe themſelves under a curſe. <hi>Their portion is curſed in the earth.</hi>

                     <hi>The voyce of the people is the voyce of God.</hi> When a man is followed with a Curſe from the moſt of men good and bad, it is an argument that there is a Curſe gone out from God againſt him; and that <hi>his portion is Curſed in the earth.</hi> Sin is the deſerving or procuring Cauſe, and the wrath of God is the inflicting or productive Cauſe of the Curſe. <hi>Balaak</hi> hired <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> to Curſe the people of God, but the Curſe could not take, the traine was laid, but he could not make the powder take fire, the Curſe came not, why? the reaſon is given, yea <hi>Balaam</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe gives it (<hi>Numb.</hi> 23.21.) <hi>He</hi> (that is, God) <hi>hath not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held Iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he ſeene perverſnes in Iſrael.</hi> If there had been iniquity, that is, any national iniquity or publicke iniquity, perſiſted in and not repented of among them, that had brought the Curſe inevitably; but though <hi>Balaam</hi> laboured to Curſe them, though he went from hill to hill, and tryed all meanes to get an opportunity to Curſe them, yet he could not, <hi>for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>God hath bleſſed them, and I cannot reverſe it. There is no Iniquity in Jacob, nor perverſnes in Iſrael,</hi> therefore their porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was bleſſed in the Earth. Sin in whomſoever it is hath a Curſe in the belly or bowels of it. Even Chriſt himſelfe taking our ſin upon him, was neceſſitated to take the Curſe upon him which was due to our ſin; Chriſt taking our ſin upon him, <hi>was</hi> (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.) <hi>made ſin for us,</hi> that is, an offering or a ſacrifice for our ſin, yea as the ſame Apoſtle ſaith (<hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13.) <hi>He was therefore made a Curſe for us.</hi> And if Chriſt who (having no ſin in him) did onely take our ſin upon him, could not avoyd the curſe, how ſhall they avoyd it, who (having no part in Chriſt) have all manner of ſin in them?</p>
                  <pb n="609" facs="tcp:153845:318"/>
                  <p>But it may be objected, All men ſin, and yet many have no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a Curſe upon them, nor is <hi>their portion Curſed in the earth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt, This aſſertion is to be limited to unbeleevers or ungodly men. Secondly, unbeleevers and ungodly men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Curſe, though the Curſe doe not breake out and appeare vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly upon them. As the portion of a godly man may be bleſſed, though there be no appearance of the bleſſing; when nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares upon him but affliction and the Croſs, yet the Godly man is bleſſed. The Croſs of a Godly man is like the proſperity of a wicked man. The former hath an outward Croſs, but a Bleſſing at the bottome; the latter hath outward proſperity, but a curſe at the bottome, and bitternes in the end. Againe, the peace of the prophane, is like the grace of hypocrites, onely a ſhew; hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites have a ſhew of grace, an appearance of holynes, yet they are but painted Sepulchres, full of rottennes within; So the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed have a ſhew of peace and proſperity, of benefits and bleſſings, but a curſe is within them, and a curſe hangs over them, ready e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very moment to drop downe upon their heads. For</p>
                  <p>Secondly, His portion is curſed, that is, 'tis under a curſe, though the curſe be not actually inflicted. As the mercies of God are ſure to his people, yet many times very ſlow, they come not preſently, but they will come. So alſo the wrath and curſe of God will ſurely come upon the wicked, though, as to outward effects &amp; impreſſions, they are ſlow and long in comming. Actings of mercy are for an appointed time; <hi>Every viſion is for an appointed time</hi> (as the Lord told his Prophet, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.3.) The viſion of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and wrath is for an appointed time, as well as the viſion of love and mercy; That is, all the love, and all the wrath, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and the curſe, which are revealed, (in any way of viſion, are for an appointed time) <hi>but at the end the viſion will ſpeake and not lye; if it tarry, waite for it, for it will ſurely come, and not tarry.</hi> As it is (I ſay) in the viſions of mercy and bleſſing, ſo in thoſe of wrath, and of the curſe; <hi>They are for an appointed time,</hi> in the end they will ſpeake. Sometimes the Curſe is quick, it apprehendeth the ſinner in the very act, it takes him in the manner, as <hi>Phineas</hi> did <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cozbi.</hi> And as (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.30.) <hi>While their meate was yet in their mouthes, the wrath of God came upon them.</hi> The ſound of the Curſe is ſometimes at the heeles of ſin, at other times
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:153845:319"/> the ſound of the Curſe is a great way behind the ſin, no ſight nor ſound of the curſe for a long time. As, <hi>light is ſowne for the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> (Pſal. 97.11.) that is, They ſhall have a crop of good things, though it lye, as ſeed doth, a great while under the clods, and as dead in the furrowes; So darkenes is ſowne for the wicked, they perceive it not yet, but they ſhall be wrapt up in it for ever; yea while they perceive it not, they are in it, and they are by ſo much the more in it, by how much the leſſe they perceive it. For, this is ever true; <hi>The portion of the wicked is Curſed in the Earth,</hi> though they ſeeme compaſſed about with bleſſings. <hi>I will Curſe your bleſſings,</hi> ſaith the Lord, (<hi>Mala.</hi> 2.2.) <hi>yea I have curſed them already.</hi> The wicked may be rich, and yet curſed, honourable, and yet curſed, ſucceſſefull in buſienes, and yet curſed, bleſſed, and yet curſed, God doth curſe their bleſſings. That which is a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the kinde and matter of it, is to ſome a curſe in the uſe and iſſue of it. So then, <hi>as, godlynes is profitable for all things, and hath the promiſe of this life as well as of that which is to come</hi> (1 Tim. 4.8.) Godlynes is compaſſed about and cloathed with promiſes of all ſorts and ſeaſons. So ungodlynes is unprofitable for all things, &amp; makes him that is ſo, miſerable in all things. For <hi>it hath the curſe of this life, and of that which is to come;</hi> if the promiſe doe not meet a godly man in this life, or in the things of this life, yet it will in the life to come, and in the things of the life to come, yea in all things ſo farre as concernes the life to come, the bleſſing alwayes meetes him. And if the curſe doe not meet a wicked man in this life, yet it will in the life to come, and in the things of the life to come, yea in all things ſo farre as concernes the life to come, The curſe alwayes meetes him.</p>
                  <p>Then ſee the folly of thoſe, who feare the Curſe, and are not afraid of ſin; as if a man ſhould feare drowning, and yet caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into the water, or feare burning, and yet throw himſelfe into the fire; thus doe they who love ſin, and feare the curſe. If the beauty of holynes doth not take upon the heart, yet the curſe that attends ſin may deterre from medling with it. And did men know the terror of the Lord, (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11.) they would eaſily be perſwaded to take heed of ſin, even of every ſin, for though uſually great ſins bring the curſe, yet the leaſt ſins may. They who know what the curſe of the Lord is, cannot but know what the terror of the Lord is, that is, that the
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:153845:319"/> Lord is (to ſinners) very terrible. For the curſe of the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding upon a ſinner, makes him every way and alwayes miſerable. There needs no more to be ſaid to prove a man miſerable then this, <hi>that his portion is curſed,</hi> or that he is under the curſe. For as the bleſſing of God makes us happy with any portion, that's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, the bleſſing being it ſelfe the beſt and moſt aboundant por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (Every good thing is vertually in the bleſſing) ſo the Curſe is vertually every evill thing; therefore that muſt needs make a man miſerable. When the Lord bleſſeth, it is not an empty word, but a power goes with it to make a man bleſſed; And when the Lord curſeth, it is not an empty word, but a power goes with it, to make a mans <hi>portion curſed in the earth. Job</hi> having layd downe this poſition, gives a proofe of it in the laſt words of the verſe.</p>
                  <q>Hee beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.</q>
                  <p>Some reade theſe (as the former) words,<note place="margin">Cohaerebit cum ſuperioribus ſi haec ſit quaſi praecedentis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitio impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis. Nullam habeat impius partem in agris lociſ<expan>

                  <p>But what is meant here <hi>by not beholding?</hi> is it onely this, he commeth not within the view or ſight of them? I conceave there is more in it then ſo, and that when <hi>Job</hi> ſayth, <hi>he beholdeth not,</hi> his meaning is, he enjoyeth vineyards no more, or he dwelleth no more in a fruitfull and pleaſant land, ſuch as that land is which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth in vineyards, and ſo conſequently with wine, but he ſhall live miſerably in a barren ſoyle. So that we may now interrogate wicked men, whether murtherers, Adulterers, or theeves (as <hi>Paul</hi> doth every ſinner, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21.) <hi>What fruit have ye of thoſe things, whereof ye are</hi> (or ought to be) <hi>aſhamed?</hi> have ye any fruit of the vine? ſurely no, For <hi>ſuch behold not the way of the vineyards.</hi> To behold is to enjoy the pleaſantnes, to taſt the ſweetnes of the fruit of the <hi>vineyards.</hi> Wine which is the fruit of the vineyard is pleaſant and delightfull, it makes glad the heart of man (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.15.) And vineyards are here named to ſignifie all ſorts of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward good things, they being the Chiefe of outward good things: For as ſometimes bread ſignifieth all outward good things, becauſe that ſtrengthens mans heart; ſo Wine, becauſe that cheareth and comforteth the heart of man. So that when <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>He ſhall not behold the way of the vineyards;</hi> It is as if he had ſayd, <hi>He ſhall not taſt of or enjoy any good thing.</hi> For</p>

                  <p>Againe, Thoſe words, <hi>he heholdeth not</hi> &amp;c. are not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as if he did voluntarily refuſe to behold, or cared not to behold the way of the vineyards, but as implying a force or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon him, by which he was kept or hindred from looking that way.</p>
                  <p>Whence take this briefe note.</p>
                  <q>The loſſe of good is a great miſery as well as the enduring of evill.</q>
                  <p>It hath been queſtioned which is greater, the puniſhment of loſſe, or the puniſhment of paine; but without all queſtion, loſſe is a very great puniſhment; not to behold the way of the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, not to returne to houſe and land, to wife and children, is a ſore affliction. What will it then be never to behold the face of God, but to be under a ſentence of eternal baniſhment from his preſence. His portion is curſed in the earth, here in this world, who beholdeth not the way of the vineyards, how then is his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion curſed in the next world, who ſhall never behold the path or way of life?</p>
                  <p>There are yet ſeveral other readings and expoſitions of theſe words.</p>
                  <p>

                     </note>Firſt, As if the meaning were to ſhew the wicked mans feare of being ſeene, becauſe of his guilt, and that therefore he would not behold or come neere <hi>the way of the vineyards,</hi> that is, thoſe places which many people have occaſion to frequent.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As if <hi>Job</hi> would here ſhew what haſt men make to eſcape who are under guilt; As if he had ſayd, The wicked man will be ſo <hi>ſet upon the run,</hi> That he will not ſtay ſo much as to view or behold his owne vineyards, formerly ſo delightfull and pleaſant to him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is conceaved to be a proverbiall ſpeech, according to which it was ironically ſayd of Malefactors who were led forth to ſuffer death, <hi>They Behold not the way of the vineyards;</hi> No they behold onely the way to the Gibbet or place of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

The wicked man periſheth, as waters that flow from a high place and returne no more.</p>
                  <p>Another following that diviſion of the word, renders the clauſe,<note place="margin">Non proſpicit inceſſum ſicut excelſorum, <hi>i. e.</hi> non curabit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedere eo modo, quo ſolent in ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere illi qui dignitate vel potentia alijs praeſunt. <hi>Bold:</hi>

                  <p>But, I ſhall not inſiſt upon eyther of theſe rendrings, though they all fall into one common channel with the former, which is to ſet forth that the wicked man is under a curſe, or that his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is curſed in the earth, yea, <hi>that a curſe is his portion.</hi> Nor ſhall I (having often obſerved from other texts of this booke the wofull end of wicked men, for this reaſon, I ſay, I ſhall not) ſtay to give any further obſervations from this clauſe, according to any of the rendrings of it: of all which I moſt embrace that of our owne tranſlaters, <hi>He ſhall not behold the way of the vineyards,</hi> not onely becauſe moſt of the learned Hebricians render it ſo, but firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it makes no diviſion of, nor puts any ſtraine at all upon any of the Original words in the text; And ſecondly, becauſe it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes (to my thoughts) ſo fayre a correſpondence with the words which follow in the two next verſes.</p>

                  <p>THere are two different tranſlations of the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe; I ſhall propoſe them, and then explicate our owne.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, (to the ſame ſenſe by way of ſimilitude) <hi>like as the dry earth and heate drinke up the ſnow water, ſo they ſin even to the grave.</hi>

                  <q>In the drought and heate they rob, and in the ſnow water.</q>
                  <p>That is, they rob and ſpoyle at all times, or in all the ſeaſons of the yeare, in hard times, in the hardeſt times, in the extremity of drought, and in the extremity of cold, They never give over, <hi>they ſin to the grave.</hi> This reading is much inſiſted upon by ſome, and as the ſence is uſefull,<note place="margin">

                  <q>In drought and heate they rob, and in the ſnow waters.</q>
                  <p>Firſt, We may conſider this drought and heate with the ſnow water as expreſſing thoſe ſeaſons which are very troubleſome to the wicked man, to doe his worke in, to rob, and ſpoyle: extreame heate, and extreame cold, are great impediments to action, yet in heate and ſnow they rob.</p>
                  <pb n="615" facs="tcp:153845:321"/>
                  <p>Whence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>A wicked man will breake through all difficulties, to finde a way to his beloved ſin.</q>
                  <p>Though he be in danger of melting with heate, or of freezing with cold, yet he will rob, or doe any other miſchiefe that his heart is ſet upon: neyther heate, nor cold, neyther wett, or dry, ſhall keepe him in, yea though an Angel with a drawne ſword in his hand ſtand in his way (as in the way of <hi>Balaam</hi>) yet, when he hath a minde, he will goe on. We may ſay of every bold and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſinner, that he ſins in heate, and cold, he ſins in the ſight of wrath and death. The threatenings (which are the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch) have the extreamity of heate and cold in them; The threatenings have ſword and fire in them, wrath and death in them, yet the wicked ſin in the face of them, and (upon the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) dare them to doe their worſt. A godly man, whoſe heart is bent and ſet heaven-ward, will walke on his way, though he muſt paſſe through heate, and cold, though he meete with dangers, and difficulties, though he meete many Lyons in his way, yet he will not turne out of his way. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelfe and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-labourers (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.4.) <hi>In all things approving our ſelves as the Miniſters of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in diſtreſſes, in ſtripes, in impriſonments,</hi> &amp;c. And a little after (<hi>v.</hi> 8.) <hi>By honour, and diſhonour, by evill report, and good report, &amp;c.</hi> Here was working in heate and cold, in fire and froſt, in all ſorts of providences from God, in all ſorts of aſpects from men. <hi>Paul</hi> and his colleagues, never minded what men did to them, but what the minde of God was they ſhould doe. And thus every godly man workes, or doth the worke of God. For though every Godly man attaines not to ſuch a degree of zeale and holy cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage as <hi>Paul</hi> had; yet he hath a truth of zeale and holy courage which will (according to his meaſure) carry him through a world of evills and incumbrances, to the doing of that good, which duty and conſcience, or the conſcience of his duty calls him to. Now as Godly men labour to approve themſelves the Miniſters or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, ſo ungodly men will approve themſelves the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of ſin in much patience, in afflictions, in neceſſities, and in diſtreſſes; they will run all hazzards, and venture through all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamities, rather then leave the law of a luſt unfulfilled. The Lord
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:153845:322"/> put the <hi>Jewes</hi> to much ſuffering for their ſins, yet ſin they would; <hi>Why ſhould ye be ſtricken any more,</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.5.) <hi>Ye will revolt more and more;</hi> while I have been ſtriking, ye have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting. The ſame pertinacy is complained of (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.17.) <hi>I ſmote him, and was wrath, yet he went on frowardly in the way of his heart;</hi> that is, in a ſinfull way. The heart of man knowes no other way, till himſelfe is formed after the heart of God, and in that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full way he will goe, though God make his heart ake as he goes, <hi>I ſmote him, and was wroth, yet he went on,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <q>In drought and heate they rob, and in the ſnow water.</q>
                  <p>Againe, we may take drought, heate, and ſnow water, not onely as importing their ſufferings while they were doing in ſuch times, but alſo as importing the ſeverall ſeaſons of time, as if he had ſayd, <hi>they will ſin both winter and ſummer,</hi> that is, continually: wee ſay of ſome, <hi>they are never well neither full nor faſting:</hi> As full and faſting imply all the conditions of man, ſo hot and cold, ſummer and winter, imply all diviſions of time.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>Evill men will doe evill allwayes.</q>
                  <p>Sinning time is never out with them, they doe not ſin by fits or ſtarts, in an ill mood onely, or through a ſtreſſe of temptation, but they ſin from a principle within, they have a ſpring of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes within, and that will ever be ſending and flowing out. A good man may be overtaken with ſin at any time, but he doth not ſin at all times, in winter, and ſummer, in heate, and cold. Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will be working where Grace is, but where Grace is not, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing workes but corruption. If wicked men be not doing evill in every moment of time, it is not becauſe they at any time would not doe evill, but becauſe at all times they cannot; And therefore the tranſlation now underhand ſpeakes of their whole life as one continued act of ſin.</p>
                  <q>They ſin to the grave.</q>
                  <p>That is, till they dye, and ſo are caryed out to the grave. So that this manner of ſpeaking, <hi>They ſin to the Grave,</hi> ſignifyes the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt perſeverance of wicked men in ſinning; as if it had not been enough to ſay, they ſin in heate, and cold, winter, and ſummer,
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:153845:322"/> but they ſin out the laſt inch of time, even till they come to the graves mouth.</p>
                  <p>Whence Note.</p>
                  <q>Wicked men will not ceaſe to ſin while they continue to live.</q>
                  <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14.) ſaith of that generation, <hi>who have eyes full of adultery, and that cannot ceaſe from ſin,</hi> ſin is their nature, it is not what they have acquired, but what is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in them, and borne with them. And becauſe ſin is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to them, therefore they cannot get it off untill their nature is changed. And hence it is that <hi>converſion</hi> or regeneration is the change of our nature as well as of our actions. A man unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſins as naturally as he lives: he ſins as naturally as he ſees or heares, or exerciſeth any of thoſe naturall faculties, ſo naturally doth he ſin, and therefore he ſins to the grave. And this is a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional demonſtration of the Juſtice of God in awarding eternall puniſhment for ſin committed in time, or in a ſhort time, (the whole time of a mans life, in which ſin is committed, is but a ſhort time, a nothing to eternity) wherein ſin ſhall be puniſhed. This, I ſay, is a demonſtration of the Juſtice of God in puniſhing wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men) becauſe if they could have lived to eternity, they would have done evill to eternity, they doe evill as they can, and as long as they can. Seeing then, there is a principle in man to ſin eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, it is but juſt with God if he puniſh ſinners eternally: did not the grave ſtop him, his heart would never ſtop him from ſin. <hi>In heate and cold they rob, they ſin to the grave.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further as theſe words are put into a ſimilitude, they intimate the eaſineſſe, and naturallneſſe of their ſinning, as well as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of it; <hi>Like as the hot earth drinketh up the ſnow water, ſo wicked men ſin to the grave:</hi> they ſin to death, and they ſin with as much eaſe and naturalnes as the earth, when dry and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, drinks up the ſnow water. Sinners are ſayd to <hi>drinke iniquity as water,</hi> (Job 15.16.) They are ſayd <hi>to draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and ſin as it were with cart ropes,</hi> (Iſa. 5.18.) The laſt of theſe compariſons notes their ſtrength and groſſeneſſe in ſinning; The ſecond notes their wit and cunning in ſinning; The third (which ſuites with the preſent text) notes their ready<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and eaſynes to ſinne; They can doe it as eaſyly as drinke, as eaſyly as the hot earth drinketh up the ſnow water.</p>

<q>So doth the grave thoſe that have ſinned.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame word is uſed indifferently in the Original both for the grave and hell; both ſignifications are made uſe of by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters in this place. Firſt, the grave or death; ſecondly, Hell, which is the ſecond death, and everlaſting death <hi>conſumeth thoſe that have ſinned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why doth he ſay, <hi>the grave conſumeth thoſe that have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?</hi> Can he meane any ſpeciall ſort of men by this, foraſmuch as all men have ſinned and ſin dayly?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, It is a truth, the grave conſumeth, and death reigneth over all, for that all have ſinned; Whereſoever ſin hath to doe, death hath to doe, the terretories of death are as large as the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retories of ſin; And had it not been for ſin, death had never had any dominion in the world, nor can the grave conſume any but thoſe who have ſinned. The Body of man had never come into the graves mouth, and it had been too hard a morſel for the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke of the grave to digeſt, had it not been for ſin; For though the body of man in its materialls and conſtitution was mortall, that is, was under a poſſibility of dying before he ſinned, yet if ſin had not brought him under the threat of death, God had never ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected him under that decree of dying, in purſuance of both which the grave now conſumeth (all) thoſe that have ſinned. The grave conſumes Godly men becauſe they have ſinned, and the grave conſumes wicked men becauſe they have ſinned; yet there is a great difference among theſe ſinners who dye, and a greater diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence among theſe ſinners when they are dead.</p>
                  <p>And therefore <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes here deſtinctively; for though it be a truth that all whether Godly or wicked have ſinned, and that the grave conſumeth all, who have ſinned; yet <hi>Job</hi> doth not here intend all men <hi>by Thoſe who have ſinned.</hi> For by them <hi>Job</hi> meanes groſſe preſumptuous and impoenitent ſinners; he meanes it not of
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:153845:324"/> thoſe who ſin according to common fraylety, but of thoſe who ſin with a high hand obſtinately. Such he meanes, even oppreſſours, adulterers, murtherers, of whom he ſpake by name before; theſe and ſuch as theſe are the ſinners whom he intends, while he ſaith, <hi>ſo doth the grave thoſe that have ſinned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it be ſaid, <hi>ſo doth the grave thoſe that</hi> (in this ſence) <hi>have not ſinned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, The Grave is ſayd in a ſpeciall manner to conſume thoſe who have thus ſinned.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe ſuch ſinners doe more ſubject and lay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves open to death, by their wicked courſes and intemperate li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. Such ſinners ſpoyle their bodyes, and corrupt their blood, they fill themſelves with diſeaſes, which bring them early to the Grave.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe God doth often cut the thread of ſuch mens lives when they are ſtrong and healthy, and tumbles them into the graves mouth to be conſumed, before they have lived out halfe their dayes.</p>
                  <p>The words being thus opened, fall under a twofold interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As implying the felicity (ſuch as it is) of wicked men in dying, or the eaſineſſe of their death; as they live in pleaſure, ſo they dye without paine.

                  <p>All men ſin, but ſome goe away with the name, as if they one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were worthy to be called ſinners. In which ſence the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt ſayth (<hi>Luke</hi> 7.37.) <hi>And behold a woman in the City which was a ſinner, when ſhe knew that Jeſus ſat in the Phariſees houſe brought an albaſter box of ointment,</hi> &amp;c. But were not all the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the City ſinners? They were ſo, but this woman had a common fame for a ſinner, that is, for an uncleane, wanton wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; ſhee was a ſinner of ſinners, the chiefe of ſinners in that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. So (<hi>Luk.</hi> 19.7.) when Chriſt went to the houſe of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> the Phariſees were vexed, and murmured, ſaying, <hi>that he was gone to be gueſt with a man which was a ſinner;</hi> As if they had ſayd, he is gon to the houſe of a notorious ſinner, a man ſo ſinfull, and guilty, that all men ſeeme innocent and ſinleſſe in compariſon of him. So they accounted <hi>That Zacheus</hi> the Publican; and doubtleſſe he was as noted a man for ſin before his converſion, as he was for grace after it. As they who are <hi>borne of God doe not commit ſin, yea, cannot ſin becauſe they are borne of God</hi> (1 Joh. 3.9.) that is, their ſinning is no ſinning in Gods account, and comparatively to the ſinning of others. So they who are borne of the Devill (as Chriſt ſaith thoſe contradicting <hi>Jewes</hi> were, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44.) doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but commit ſin, and ſin ſo as if they (and their like) alone did ſin.

                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>They who are extreamely ſinfull, make themſelves ſevenfold more ſubject to death then other men.</q>
                  <p>They who ſin as if none did ſin but they, are ſo ſubject to death, as if none were ſubject to death but they. For if every ſin, the leaſt ſin doth put us into the hand or under the power of death, then great ſins multiplyed and continued in, put us into the hand and under the power of death much more. The Pſalmiſt ſaith of wicked worldly men (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.14.) <hi>Like ſheepe they are layd in the grave, death ſhall feed on them, and their beauty ſhall conſume in the grave, from their dwelling;</hi> or (as we put in the Margin) <hi>the grave being an habitation to every one of them ſhall conſume their beauty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſome may object, Is not this true of Godly men too, are not they thus handled by death, and the grave? doth not death feed on them? and doth not the grave conſume their beauty?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, though it doth, yet it doth not ſo feed upon, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume them, as it feedes upon and conſumes wicked men. For the Pſalmiſt ſpeakes here of death as it were triumphing over the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, whereas the Godly triumph over death. For, firſt he ſaith, The wicked are <hi>layd in the grave like ſheepe;</hi> They lived like <hi>Wolves or Lyons,</hi> but they are layd in the grave <hi>like ſheepe.</hi> If it be asked, why like ſheepe? I anſwer, not for the innocency of their lives, but for their impotency in death; as if it had been ſayd, when once death took them in hand to lay them in the grave, they could make no more reſiſtance then a ſheepe can againſt a Lyon or a Wolfe; And when death hath thus layd them in the grave, then ſecondly (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>death ſhall feed on them,</hi> as a Lyon doth upon a ſheepe, or any wild beaſt upon his prey, which is a further degree of deaths triumph over the wicked; And thirdly, <hi>their beauty ſhall conſume in the grave,</hi> that is, all their bodily and natural beauty (and that is all the beauty which they have) ſhall conſume in the Grave, whereas the Godly, have a beauty (and they count it their onely beauty) which the grave cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, and that is the beauty of their graces, the beauty of holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the ſpirituall beauty of the inner man, yea and the ſpirituall
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:153845:325"/> beauty of their outward holy actings ſhall not conſume in the Grave; For <hi>bleſſed are the dead that dye in the Lord, for from henceforth, ſaith the Spirit, they reſt from their labours, and their workes follow them</hi> (Rev. 14.13.) that is, their good workes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them (not to death but into life) and will be both beauty and bleſſednes to them from the Lord for ever. Whereas curſed are the dead that dye in their ſins, for from henceforth, they ſhall be denyed reſt for ever, and none of their workes, wherein they tooke pleaſure in this world, ſhall follow them into the next to give them any pleaſure. All their beauty and outward bleſſednes ends in the grave. <hi>If in this life onely we have hope in Chriſt,</hi> ſayth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of beleevers (1 Cor. 15.19.) <hi>we are of all men moſt miſerable;</hi> then how miſerable are they, who have no hope beyond this life, or if they have, both that, and their preſent beauty conſume toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the grave. Thus it is plaine, that though godly men dye, yet death hath not ſuch a hand over them, as over the wicked. And as wicked men are more under the hand of death then the Godly when they dye, ſo they are continually more lyable unto death. Sin, which unfits men to dye comfortably, fits them (as it were) to dye naturally: The more ſinfull any man is, the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may death ſurpriſe him. Holynes hath not onely a promiſe of eternall life hereafter, but of a long life here (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.12, 13.) And ſin is not onely under a threat of eternal death hereafter, but of a ſpeedy death here. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.23.) <hi>But thou O Lord ſhalt bring them</hi> (that is, wicked men) <hi>downe into the pit of deſtruction,</hi> (But when? it may be long firſt, the next words make anſwer) <hi>Bloody and deceitfull men ſhall not live out halfe their dayes;</hi> That is, not halfe the dayes which as others doe ſo they naturally might live; eyther the Juſtice of God or of man ſhall cut ſuch men off in the midſt of their dayes.

                     <hi>Love, mercie, or pittie ſhall forget him.</hi> Which may be taken two wayes; Firſt, that thoſe friends who before were pittifull to him, ſhould forget him; his lovers, and acquaintance, who were deare to him even as his bowels, they ſhall forget him; or ſecondly, <hi>mercy ſhall forget him,</hi> that is, the mercy of God, or the God of mercy ſhall forget him, God who is all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together mercy ſhall forget him; hell ſhall conſume him, and
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:153845:326"/> mercy, or the mercifull God ſhall forget him for ever. The vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar reads it by way of imprecation, <hi>let mercy forget him;</hi> others as a direct denunciation, <hi>mercy ſhall forget him;</hi> But I rather ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that this phraſe, or manner of ſpeaking, <hi>The wombe ſhall forget him,</hi> doth onely import thus much; That when the wicked man dyeth, he ſhall be as much forgotten among men, as if ſuch a man had never come out of his mothers wombe, nor been born into the world. But are not wicked men remembred to have been in the world when once they goe out of the world? uſually they doe ſuch things in the world as cannot eaſily be forgotten; And are not many wicked men, who dyed ſome thouſands of yeares agoe, remembred unto this day, as if they had dyed but yeſterday? I anſwer, As to forget, alwayes implyeth former knowledge, and acquaintance, ſo ſometimes it implyeth onely preſent neglect. When we paſſe by, or ſlight a man, then we are ſayd to forget him, though we not onely remember who he is, but ſee him before our eyes. Much more then may we be ſayd to forget thoſe men being dead, whom we ſlighted while they lived, and never ſpeake of but with contempt and abhorrence both of their perſons and actions ſince they dyed. <hi>The wombe ſhall forget him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet as the former verſe is expounded by ſome, (as was there touched) to ſhew how quiet and eaſie a paſſage wicked men uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally have out of this world by death, ſo this clauſe alſo of the verſe in hand, yea the whole verſe is expounded to the ſame ſence; I will onely hint it, and paſſe onne.</p>
                  <q>The wombe ſhall forget him.</q>
                  <p>That is, his mother ſhall not be troubled or grieved at his death, becauſe he dyed without griefe or trouble.</p>
                  <q>The wormes ſhall feede ſweetly on him.</q>
                  <p>That is, The grave ſhall be no ſeveerer to him then to others.<note place="margin">Ita ſuavitèr ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dormit, ut in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchro ei ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis duſceſcere videatur. <hi>Druſ:</hi>

                  </p>
                  <q>He ſhall be no more remembred.</q>
                  <p>That is, there ſhall no hard fate or evill accident befall him
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:153845:327"/> when he dyes to adminiſter matter of diſcourſe concerning him: for when a man is cut off by ſome remarkeable ſtroake of Judgement eyther from the hand of God or man, his death becomes the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and Table-talke of all ſorts of men, for that generation at leaſt, if not for many more. What hath cauſed <hi>Korah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> to be remembred to this day, was it not the ſtrangenes of their death? (<hi>Numb.</hi> 14.29, 30.) <hi>And Moſes ſayd, If theſe men dye the common death of all men, or if they be viſited after the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of all men, then the Lord hath not ſent me; but if the Lord make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and ſwallow them up,</hi> &amp;c. This dreadfull hand of God upon them in ſwallowing them up alive, hath made them to be remembred more then many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of honeſt and good men in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who dyed in their beds. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account <hi>Ananias</hi> &amp; <hi>Saphira</hi> are remembred, and ſo is <hi>That Herod (Act.</hi> 12.23.) <hi>Who was eaten of wormes &amp; gave up the Ghoſt, becauſe he gave not glory unto God.</hi> But ſaith <hi>Job</hi> (according to this expoſition) the wicked mans death is commonly ſo fayre, and ſo much after the common death of all men, that no man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remembers him any more.</p>
                  <q>And wickedneſſe ſhall be broken as a tree.</q>
                  <p>That is, the wicked man ſhall dye like an old rotten tree, he ſhall moulder away and decay by peice-meale, or gradually, as a tree doth which is never hewen downe, but is ſuffered to waſt and dye alone. Thus the interpretation is carried through the whole verſe, as a proofe, that bad men may (in this kinde) have a good death.</p>
                  <p>But though this be a truth, and ſuites well with <hi>Jobs</hi> ſcope in ſome paſſages of this Chapter, as alſo in other paſſages of this booke, that wicked men dye as to outward appearance as fairely, and ſweetly, as the godly, ſo that as no man <hi>knoweth love, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by all that is before him, but all things</hi> (in this life) <hi>come alike to all; There is one event to the righteous and to the wicked</hi> (Eccl: 9.1, 2.) So all things come alike to all in death, ſo farre as it meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concernes the ſeparation of ſoule and body; yet I rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that this verſe declares wrath and judgement to wicked men dying, or their miſery and wretchednes in death. And therefore firſt, <hi>the wombe,</hi> that is, his neereſt relations, and friends, even his mother, and wife, <hi>ſhall forget him.</hi> They expected no good from
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:153845:327"/> him while he lived, and ſo it was little ſorrow to them when he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Some men live till their friends are weary of them,<note place="margin">Mater quia a vivo nihil ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectabat ſolain, neq pro mortuo amplius angi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> &amp; every one thinks the world is well rid of them when they dye. Secondly, <hi>The worme ſhall feed ſweetly on him,</hi> that is, as he fed ſweetly upon ſin before, ſo now the worme ſhall have a ſweete morſell of him; Which ſome interpret alſo as a circumlocution of an ignominious or at leaſt a vulgar buryall; as if he had ſayd, he ſhall not have the buryall of the noble and honourable, who uſually are ſecured from wormes by ſpices and imbalmings (ſpice and perfume fence the dead body againſt the worme) But though he lived honourably, death ſhall overtake him, and he ſhall be buryed ignominiouſly, or he ſhall be buryed among common men, he ſhall not have that priviledge which appertaines to his ſtate, preſervation from the wormes. And (which is a greater miſery then both the former) Thirdly, <hi>He ſhall be no more remembred,</hi> that is, he ſhall be no more ſpoken of with honour, but his name ſhall rot, as a man that is not worth the remembring. His name ſhall not be regiſterd with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, nor kept upon the file, with men of credit and renowne. So that as the firſt part of the verſe ſhewes how his neereſt relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and lovers ſhall forget him, ſo this latter part ſhewes that <hi>he ſhall be remembred no more</hi> of any others.</p>

Blot me out of the booke which thou haſt written.</hi> This alſo is a fayre interpretation of <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning (<hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3.) when he wiſhed <hi>himſelfe accurſed from Chriſt for his brethren, his kinſmen according to the fleſh.</hi> We may ſuppoſe that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were moved with the ſame Spirit of zeale for the Glory of God in both their wiſhes; And that when <hi>Moſes</hi> wiſhed (upon that account) to be blotted out of the Booke which God had written, he wiſhed the ſame thing which <hi>Paul</hi> did, when he wiſhed to be accurſed or an anathema from Chriſt; That is, to be as a perſon ſeparated or excommunicated from the ſociety or communion of the faithfull, and ſo no more to be remembred among the Saints, or to have his name blotted out of the Church-records, though he had been ſo great a planter and propagater of the Churches. There are two Scriptures that ſpeake of ſuch writings or holy records (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.3.) <hi>It ſhall then come to paſſe, that he that is left in Sion, and he that remains in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem ſhall be called holy, even every one that is written among the living</hi> (or to life) <hi>in Jeruſalem.</hi> Many might live in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who were not written among the living, or to life in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Thus to be written <hi>to life,</hi> or among the living, is to be written in the Catalogue of thoſe who are reckoned to have a life of Grace, holynes, and ſanctification here, as alſo to be heyres and expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of a life of Glory hereafter. Againe we have a like evidence of this (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.9.) <hi>My hand ſhall be upon the Prophets that ſee vanity, and that divine lies, they ſhall not be in the aſſembly of my people, neither ſhall they be written in the writing of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> As when the Lord brought the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:153845:329"/> 
                     <hi>Aegypt,</hi> he commanded them to be muſtered or numbred (<hi>Num.</hi> 1.2, 3.) Thus alſo when they returned from the Babylonian Captivity, they were numbred againe (<hi>Ezr:</hi> Chap. 2. <hi>Neh.</hi> Chap. 7.) Now thoſe records in which their names were written, are conceaved to be <hi>the writings of the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> mentioned in this 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> as alſo, <hi>the Booke of the living or to life,</hi> in the fourth of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> at leaſt that both theſe Scriptures allude to thoſe records. And it was the cuſtome of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> that when any of them acted wickedly, his name was raſed out of thoſe records as unworthy to be remembred among the people of God, and was looked upon as a dead man, yea as a damned man, who hath no name in the booke of life ſo often mentioned in Scripture, or whoſe name might be ſayd to be blotted out of it.</p>
                  <p>From all which it appeares how great a curſe it is to be no more remembred, with reſpect and honour, which <hi>Job</hi> affirmes ſhall be the condition of wicked men. Which he further confirmes in the laſt clauſe of the verſe.</p>
                  <q>And wickedneſſe ſhall be broken as a tree.</q>
                  <p>Here the abſtract (as elſewhere frequently in Scripture) is put for the concrete, That man who obſtinately perſeveres in ſin, is not onely wicked, but wickedneſſe it ſelfe. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.42.) <hi>All iniquity ſhall ſtop her mouth,</hi> that is, ſuch men as are full of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhall have nothing to ſay or object againſt the righteous deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God, but ſhall be ſilent in darkenes. So (<hi>Job</hi> 35.13.) men extreamely vaine are called <hi>vanity,</hi> and we uſually call crafty men craft, covetous men covetouſneſſe, and proud men are called pride; So a man much given to peace, is in Scripture-language called peace, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 120.7.) <hi>I am peace,</hi> or <hi>I peace, but they make themſelves ready for warre.</hi> They who are much carryed to or in any thing, are ſometimes called by the name of that thing, or they take the name of it upon themſelves. Thus <hi>David</hi> ſpake (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 109.4.) <hi>For my love they are my adverſaries, but I give my ſelfe to prayer;</hi> The Hebrew is, <hi>I prayer. David</hi> was ſo much ſet upon prayer, that he was prayer it ſelfe; and a wicked man is ſo ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wickedneſſe, that he is wickedneſſe it ſelfe.</p>
                  <q>Wickedneſſe ſhall be broken as a tree.</q>
                  <p>What tree? The text determines not, but ſpeakes indefinitely,
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:153845:329"/> 
                     <hi>as a tree.</hi> We may underſtand it firſt of a barren tree; barren trees are broken, and cut downe. The word <hi>broken,</hi> imports vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and ſo <hi>a violent breaking;</hi> wicked men ſhall be broken vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently. Chriſt ſayth of the Barren tree (<hi>Luk.</hi> 13.8.) <hi>Cut it downe, why cumbereth it the ground.</hi> Fruitfull trees adorne and beautifie the ground, but barren trees doe onely burden and cumber it. <hi>As good not to be as to be good for nothing.</hi> The wicked ſhall be cut downe and broken as a barren tree; ſecondly (which provokes more to breaking) <hi>they ſhall be broken as a tree that bringeth forth diſtaſtfull, bitter, poyſonous fruite;</hi> It is not good to let a tree live, which brings forth evill and deadly fruit. If they deſerve to be broken who bring forth no fruit, then much more they who bring forth none but noughty fruit. Now as the wicked are alwayes barren of good fruit, ſo they are alwayes bearing evill fruit, nor can they beare any other, <hi>Doe men gather grapes of thornes?</hi> Thirdly, they ſhall be broken as a tree that is rent and ſhivered both body and boughes with a tempeſt, or ſtorme of thunder and lightening; Thus many tall and goodly trees are broken, and thus the wicked ſhall be broken, a ſtorme, a tempeſt from heaven ſhall breake them. The downefall and deſtruction of wicked men hath been inſiſted upon from other paſſages of this booke, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I forbeare to adde any thing further here.</p>

The reaſon of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is, as the gramarians ſpeake, becauſe the nomnative Caſe is not here ſet downe (and according to the Conciſenes of the Hebrew tongue it is uſuall to leave it out) the verbe onely being expreſſed, whence ſome referre it to man, others to God.</p>

(<hi>Prov.</hi> 28.7.) <hi>Whoſoever keepeth the Law is a wiſe Son, but he that is a Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of riotous men</hi> (wee put in the margin, <hi>hee that feedeth gluttons) ſhameth his father.</hi> According to this ſence of the word the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation is given thus; <hi>hee feedeth the barren that beareth not,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pavit ſterilem quae non parit. <hi>Vulg:</hi> Alit ſterilia ſcorta, non pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis ſed obſcaenae voluptatis gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</note> 
                     <hi>and doeth not good to the widdow;</hi> That is, hee runs after harlots, and feedeth them; ſuch lewd women are expreſſed <hi>by the barren,</hi> becauſe ſuch ſeldome bring forth Children, nor doe they deſire it, being ſo intent upon the fullfilling of their wanton or covetous luſts, that they quite forget the ends of marriage. Thus the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal ſonne lived after he was gone from his Father, as his Elder brother gave the character of his ſinfull courſe of life, which his father (upon his returne and humiliation) had covered and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given (<hi>Luk.</hi> 15.30.) <hi>As ſoone as this thy ſonne was come, which had devoured thy living with harlots,</hi> &amp;c. They who feed and keepe ſuch barren ones, ſhall be kept bare and feed barely enough themſelves, if they be not quite devoured.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The word ſignifies as the care of the ſhepheard in feeding his flock, or the care of a father in feeding his houſhold, ſo it ſignifies to feed upon, to eate up and devoure: and then the ſence is; <hi>hee eateth up, or hee devoureth the barren;</hi> which rendring falls in with ours, <hi>hee evill entreateth the barren;</hi> hee that devoures and eates them up, <hi>evill entreates them.</hi> To which ſence alſo the word is tranſlated <hi>to breake or to ſpoyle, (Jer.</hi> 11.16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.9.) <hi>Hee ſhall breake them with a rod of Iron.</hi> Thus hee eateth up or

                     <hi>The barren,</hi> in ſtrictnes of ſignification, are they that have not received the bleſſing of fruitfullnes in Child-bearing; and this phraſe, <hi>the barren that beareth not,</hi> implyes a woman that never bare children.

The Church of the <hi>Jewes</hi> was fruitfull, ſhee brought forth, but the Gentiles were barren; yet at laſt the Gentiles were brought forth into a Church, and then they brought forth aboundantly, both in reference to holy actions, and holy perſons; for as the Apoſtle applyeth that Prophecy (<hi>Gal.</hi> 4.27.) <hi>The deſolate hath many moe children then ſhee that hath a husband.</hi> Barrennes is an affliction, yea it was a reproach; and therefore that good woman <hi>Hannah</hi> when God heard her prayer and gave her a childe, ſaid, <hi>God hath taken away my reproach.</hi>

                  <p>Againe, I Conceive wee may take the word <hi>barren</hi> here, not onely ſtrictly for one that beareth not, but largely for any one that is in a ſad or afflicted Condition, as the words <hi>widdow</hi> and <hi>father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> are often uſed in Scripture, not onely for ſuch as have no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or have loſt their husband, but for any that are in a troubled or low eſtate.

For firſt the widow is bound, though ſhee be looſe from her husband: ſhee is bound, and that two wayes; firſt, with troubles, that's her affliction; ſecondly, ſhee is bound to be or ſtay much at home, that's her duty; ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the widow is home-bound, ſo ſhe is tongue-bound too; the widows eloquence is ſilence, ſhe ſpeakes moſt to her owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation when ſhe ſpeakes little. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> reproves widows about two things, which diſcover two faylings in them, oppoſite to both theſe latter bindings (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.13. <hi>And withall they learne to be idle, wandering from houſe to houſe;</hi> As if he had ſayd, it is not comely for the widow to wander abroad, ſhe ſhould ſtay at home; the widow ſhould be a fixed ſtarre, not a planet.

                     </note> The word may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note a twofold drawing. Firſt, drawing by a ſecret hidden &amp; imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible power, a moral power, the power of perſwaſion working upon the heart and influencing the affections. There is an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal atractive vertue, which draweth the mind as the loadſtone doth iron, when nothing is ſeene, nor ſo much as a word heard. The word is uſed in that ſence (<hi>Judg</hi> 4.6, 7.) where (the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> being ſore oppreſſed by <hi>Jabins</hi> Army under the conduct of <hi>Siſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra) Deborah</hi> the Propheteſſe, who at that time Judged <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſent and called <hi>Baruch</hi> and ſaid unto him, <hi>Hath not the Lord God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael Commanded, ſaying, goe and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thouſand men of the Children of Napthali, and of the Children of Zebulun.</hi> Thus God bid them draw to that place.
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:153845:333"/> But what had God promiſed? <hi>Deborah</hi> tells him what in the next verſe; <hi>And I will draw unto thee to the river Kiſhon, Siſera the Captaine of Jabins Army with his Chariots and his multitude, and will deliver him into thine hand.</hi> But it may be queſtioned how God would draw <hi>Siſera</hi> with his Army thither? It was not by any outward force, onely God put a purpoſe into his heart to draw up his Army to that place, that ſo he might fall into the ſnare; <hi>Siſera</hi> had a ſecret motion or impulſe upon his ſpirit, which he could not withſtand, though he fell by obeying it. Thus alſo God draweth ſoules to himſelfe, by the inviſible power of his Spirit, in their effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall vocation and Converſion. (<hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44.) <hi>No man can come to me except the father which ſent me draw him:</hi> how doth God draw? hee drawes by perſwaſion, not by compulſion; his perſwaſion carryes a mighty commanding power with it: This drawing is not a bare moral perſwaſion, by the propoſal of an object before them, and ſo leaving the ſinner purely to his owne election, but it is a perſwaſion which hath an over-comming power going along with it; God doth not draw us againſt our wills to Chriſt, but hee drawes the will to Chriſt, or makes us willing to come to Chriſt. And the Lord drawes beleevers thus alſo after converſion to nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer converſe with Chriſt. The Church begged the putting forth of this powerfull drawing (<hi>Cant.</hi> 1.3.) <hi>Draw me and I will run after thee.</hi> As the ſoule muſt have a drawing before we can come to Chriſt at all, ſo after we are come to Chriſt, wee need drawing ſtill, that we may follow hard after him. This ſence of the word may have place in the preſent text. Wicked men have a power of drawing others after them, though they doe not act any outward power. <hi>Hee draweth the mighty by his power;</hi> That is, he allureth them to his ſide, or to a complyance with him; And he doth this ſometimes as without any formal threatnings to exerciſe his power againſt them, ſo without any formal promiſes of uſing his power for them; As they uſually draw the mighty by the power of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, ſo their power and example draw much without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a drawing by an outward violence, or a drawing by force. And this I take to be moſt proper here; Hee cauſeth the mighty to come in and ſtoope to his power, though they have no mind at all to it.</p>

For hee is a terror not onely to evill doers (as all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates ought to be, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.3.) but he is a terror to thoſe that doe well; ſecondly, <hi>He riſeth up,</hi> that is, he groweth angry and enraged, his choler boyles in him, and then no man (of them eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially againſt whom he is enraged) is ſure of his life. And when he ſayth (in reference to any of theſe caſes) <hi>no man is ſure of his life,</hi> the meaning is, every man hath great reaſon to feare, if not utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deſpaire of his life; no man is abſolutely ſure of his life at any time; for (as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſayth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.14.) <hi>What is our life? it is even a vapour that appeareth a little time, and then vaniſheth away;</hi> and how ſhort the time of its appearance will be no man knoweth, therefore (I ſay) no man can at any time be abſolutely ſure of his life, no not for the leaſt moment of time, but at ſometimes our lives are leſſe ſure to us then at others, yea at ſometimes we have no aſſurance at all of our lives, and we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have leſſe hope to live, or leſſe hold of life, then when The wicked man <hi>riſeth up.</hi>

<pb n="644" facs="tcp:153845:336"/> are in the hight of proſperity, no man is in ſafety. (<hi>Pro.</hi> 11.10, 11.) <hi>When it goeth well with the righteous the City rejoyceth, and when the wicked periſh there is ſafety: by the bleſſing of the upright the City is exalted, but it is overthrowne by the mouth of the wicked,</hi> that is, by the mouth of thoſe wicked men who are in power; their riſing is the fall of the righteous, and with their fall, the righteous riſe. <hi>When the wicked periſh there is ſafety.</hi> And againe, (<hi>Pro.</hi> 28.12.) <hi>When righteous men doe rejoyce, there is great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> That is, when righteous men proſper (the effect is put for the cauſe, or the conſequent for the antecedent, joy follows pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, when (I ſay) it is thus with righteous men) <hi>there is great glory,</hi> that is, men appeare in their beſt both by words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The joy of the righteous is not alone, many others rejoyce with bim, yea, are made joyfull by him. So that when the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous riſe up in honour and authority, all men ſet themſelves out to the utmoſt, and doe as it were cloath the dignity of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men with glory. Then they are willing to ſhew what they have, becauſe they know, they ſhall keepe what they have ſafely. And the freenes of their glorying when the righteous rejoyce, ſheweth the freedome which they enjoy under the power of the righteous. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi> in the ſame place) <hi>when the wicked riſe</hi> (which is the word of the text) <hi>a man is hidden.</hi> Which may be expounded firſt thus. The wicked when they riſe doe ſcarſe ſhew themſelves to be men, they are ſo inhumane and cruel, which ſuites wel with the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of the ſame Chapter, <hi>As a roaring Lion and a ranging Beare, ſo is a wicked ruler over the poore people.</hi> So that nothing of a man appeares in them when they are in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Secondly, we may take the meaning (more nere the preſent poynt) thus; <hi>When the wicked riſe,</hi> that is, to greatnes and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>A man is hidden,</hi> that is, men keepe as cloſe and private as they can, as if they were affrayd to be ſeene, and doubted <hi>they ſhould be ruined by their riſing.</hi> When the wicked appeare moſt, the godly run into holes; for they inſtead of being a ſhield of protection and defence to the Godly, are a ſnare, a ſword, and vexation to all that are about them; they uſe their power for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and not for Edification. The Apoſtle (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.7.) ſpeaking of the power given him by Chriſt in the Goſpel, ſaith, <hi>It is for Edification, not for deſtruction;</hi> the deſigne of that power is to build up, and not to throw downe; So the great deſigne
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:153845:336"/> of all power in the hand of the Magiſtrate as well as of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery is for Edification, not for deſtruction; deſtruction is that which comes but by accident, by reaſon of the ſin and wickednes that men doe; the great buſines of the Magiſtrate is to ſave, to build up, and to defend; yet ſuch is the wickednes of mans heart, that many times when he hath power in his hand, <hi>no man is ſure of his life.</hi> Hee is ſo farre from giving aſſurance, protection, and defence to all by his power, that his power is every mans danger. And hence <hi>Solomon</hi> concludes (<hi>Prov.</hi> 29.2.) <hi>When the righteous are in authority the people rejoyce, but when the wicked beareth rule the people mourne.</hi> It cannot but be ſad with them who have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſure to them; they muſt needes mourne who have neyther eſtate, nor liberty, nor life ſure to them; they muſt needes mourne who ſee nothing ſo ſure to them as ſorrow. As to have our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall calling and eternal election made ſure to us, is the top of all joy to us in this world; So to have nothing in this world ſure to us, no not ſo much as our life (in the ſence explained) ſure to us, is the bottome and loweſt of all that ſorrow which concernes this preſent world. And this ſorrow the wicked mans exaltation brings upon all men; <hi>He riſeth up and no man is ſure of his life.</hi>

                     <hi>Job</hi> further deſcribeth the ſtate of wicked men in their proſperity: wee may read the text thus; <hi>If any one giveth to be in ſafety,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo the ſence of this verſe falls in with the Interpretation of the words laſt opened; <hi>If any one giveth to be in ſafety,</hi> that is, this man is ſo wicked, that though any poore man, or any who are in feare of him would beſtow large gifts upon him to bribe him for his favour, or ſtay his hand from oppreſſion, that they might live quietly by him, and ſo ſhould truſt upon him, that having received their money, ſurely hee would let them alone, and they ſhould be quiet, <hi>yet his eyes are upon their wayes;</hi> that is, hee is looking about him, to pick holes in their Coate, and finde ſome advantage againſt them to bring them into trouble.

This is a truth, though a man buy his peace at a very deare rate of wicked men, yet there is no aſſurance to be had: bribeing and ſubmiſſion, and flattery will not hold long; many examples have proved that theſe things have not ſecured good men from the oppreſſion of tyrants; but they have quickly found out a way to ruine them that have been moſt liberal in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to gaine their favour, and purchaſe their owne peace. If any one give to be in ſafety, and truſteth he ſhall be ſafe, his truſt will fayle him; <hi>The more we truſt God the ſafer we are, but there is no ſafety to be had by truſting ungodly men.</hi> This is a good ſence, yet, rather according to our tranſlation, the words ſhew the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the wicked man himſelfe in his proſperity.</p>

                  <p>We finde it promiſed among many other ſpeciall mercyes to the Church in her beſt eſtate (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.27.) <hi>The tree of the feild ſhall yeild her fruit, and the earth ſhall yeild her encreaſe, and they ſhall be ſafe in their land.</hi> And ſuch was their old promiſe (<hi>Lev:</hi> 26.5.) <hi>Ye ſhall eate your bread to the full, and dwell in your land ſafely.</hi> (Deut. 33.28.) <hi>Iſrael ſhall dwell in ſafety alone.</hi> Though <hi>Iſrael</hi> be alone he ſhall dwel in ſafety, or <hi>Iſrael</hi> alone ſhall dwell in ſafety.

                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>Outward proſperity is the foundation of a wicked mans peace.</q>
                  <p>God giveth him ſafety, and he makes his ſafety his God. He reſteth in the ſafety which God giveth him, not in God who gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him ſafety. Carnal men looſe God in the creature; and whereas they ſhould truſt in God, becauſe he ſendeth them good things, they truſt upon the good things which God ſendeth. In whatſoever (beſides God) we place our truſt, that we put in the place of God. <hi>David</hi> was much overſhot in this poynt
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:153845:338"/> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.6.) <hi>In my proſperity I ſaid I ſhall never be moved;</hi> God made <hi>David</hi> proſper, and <hi>David</hi> reſted in his proſperity. When <hi>David</hi> was right, he ſayd in his adverſity (and every god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man may ſay in his deepeſt adverſity) <hi>I ſhall never be moved.</hi> God is as ſtrong to us in our greateſt weakenes as when he makes our mountaine ſtrongeſt; and they who thinke themſelves more immoveable when their mountaine is ſtrong, then when it is weak, reſt in their mountaine not in God. Now if <hi>David</hi> (a man after Gods owne heart) ſet or reſted his heart ſo much upon his moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine (that is, his worldly proſperity) becauſe it was ſtrong, how much more may carnal men grow into an admiration of their earthly mountaines, and reſt under their ſhadow and ſhelter, as if they could never be moved? Worldly men doe this ſo much that this is made the deſcription of worldly men (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.6.) <hi>They that truſt in their wealth, and boaſt themſelves in the multitude of their riches.</hi> Who theſe are is not expreſſed, as if every one muſt needs know what ſort of men they are who truſt in their wealth; that is who ſee all well with them, and who ſay all ſhall be well with them, becauſe of the multitude of their riches. For that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to truſt in riches, when a man ſayth to himſelfe (as the rich <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> ſayd, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.19.) <hi>Soule, take thine eaſe; thou haſt much goods laid up for many yeares, Eate and drinke, and be merry. Job</hi> had another ſpirit in the midſt of his proſperity (<hi>Chap.</hi> 3.26.) <hi>I was not in ſafety, neither had I reſt,</hi> &amp;c. he ſpake there of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition before he was in trouble, when hee had ſome thouſands of ſheepe, ſome hundreds of oxen, with a multitude of Camells and Aſſes, when hee had many ſons and daughters, with ſervants in great number; When it was thus with him, when no Cloud had in the leaſt darkened his day, nor ſo much as a graine of gall or wormewood embittered his cup; when he was thus ſafe, yet hee ſayd I was not in ſafety. When the Devill ſaid hee was ſo ſafe that hee could not touch him; <hi>Thou haſt made a hedge about him,</hi> yet hee ſayd, <hi>I was not in ſafety, neyther had I reſt;</hi> that is, hee looked upon his hedge as upon that which might quickly be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken through, &amp; upon his mountaine, as that which might not onely be quickly moved, but quite removed, he ſaw all he had ſhakeing and tottering, and ſo could not have any reſt in any thing which he had: he had reſt in oppoſition to murmuring and diſcontent about the things of this world, but he was reſtleſſe in oppoſition
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:153845:338"/> to confiding in and ſatisfaction with the things of this world. In this reſpect his very ſafety was unſafe, and his reſt, reſtleſſe to him. Only the carnal man, when God giveth him to be in ſafety, reſteth in it; he ſits downe and concludeth that he hath enough at preſent, and that his Enough will laſt for Ever; He reſteth in his ſafety, not onely as being out of danger, but above it. <hi>Job</hi> having thus ſet forth the outward ſtate of the wicked man, <hi>he is in ſafety,</hi> as alſo the ſtate of his inward man, <hi>He reſteth in it;</hi> ſheweth us in the laſt place and cloſe of the verſe, what God is doing towards him, while he is doing thus, or notwithſtanding he doth thus,
<q>Yet his eyes are upon their wayes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some read, <hi>though his eyes are upon their wayes,</hi> and give the ſence thus, <hi>though God ſeeth all their wickednes, yet hee lets them proceed and proſper;</hi> That's a truth; God doth not let wicked men proſper, becauſe hee doth not know how wicked they are, or what wickedneſſe they doe; hee knowes well enough, how ill they are, and what evill they doe, his eyes are upon their wayes, while they abuſe his mercyes, and (in ſtead of reſting in him who gives them ſafety) reſt in the ſafety which he hath given them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others read thus, <hi>and his eyes are upon their wayes;</hi> as if the words were a further deſcription of the wicked mans out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proſperity, and a deſcription of it to ſuch a height,<note place="margin">Quaſi intentis in ipſos dei ipſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us oculis ut eis omnia ex ipſoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> animi ſententia ſuccederent. <hi>Bez:</hi> Plus eſt quod probatur aſpectu quam quod ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone laudatur. <hi>Ambroſ:</hi>
                     </note> as if the eyes of God were fixed or faſtned upon his wayes, to take care of him, and to cauſe him to proſper in them; as if the eyes of God did drop bleſſings upon him, and guide him every day ſucceſſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all his undertakings. The eye of God upon a place or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon implyeth (in Scripture language) his preſence with them for good. (<hi>Deut.</hi> 11.12.) <hi>The land whither thou goeſt in to poſſeſſe it, is not like Aegypt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but it is a land which the Lord thy God careth for, the eyes of the Lord thy God are alwayes upon it, from the beginning of the yeare even unto the end of the yeare;</hi> as if he had ſayd, The Lord is uneeſſantly watchfull over it, both to prevent evill, and to beſtow good upon it. Read the ſame ſence of the phraſe (<hi>Ezra</hi> 5.5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.15.) And uſually in Scripture when the eye of God is ſayd to be upon any, it is not taken in an evill ſence unleſſe ſo expreſt: as (<hi>Amos</hi> 9.4.) <hi>Mine eyes ſhall be upon them for evill and not for good.</hi> So that, while <hi>Job</hi> ſayth, <hi>And his eyes are upon their wayes,</hi> The words, according to
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:153845:339"/> this reading, continue, if not highten the former ſence, ſhewing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the outward proſperity of evill men by the ſeeming favour of God to them.</p>
                  <p>But I rather cloſe with our reading, <hi>yet his Eyes are upon their wayes;</hi> as if he had ſayd; <hi>Doe not thinke that God taketh no notice of their ſinfull Courſes, becauſe hee gives them to be in ſafety, and in ſuch ſafety, that they reſt and truſt upon it, for I tell you the eyes of God are upon their wayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>God alwayes ſeeth the wayes of wicked men, or hee ſeeth wicked men in all their wayes.</q>
                  <p>It is no argument that God neglecteth the government of the world, becauſe wicked men are in ſafety; Hee fully conſidereth their wayes, who eyther through ignorance are wandring from, or, through wilfullnes, turning out of his wayes.</p>
                  <p>And the eye of God is upon the wayes of ſuch men, not onely to ſee which way,<note place="margin">Hic opponitur conniventiae &amp; diſſimulationi. <hi>Coc:</hi>
                     </note> or whither they are going (<hi>Job</hi> 34.21.) but to puniſh them for their going wrong. God will not connive at, nor diſſemble what he ſeeth when he ſeeth what is unfit. (<hi>Hab.</hi> 3.6.) <hi>Hee ſtood and meaſured the earth, hee beheld and drove aſunder the nations,</hi> that is, he divided and brake thoſe nations in whom he beheld iniquity. (<hi>Zach.</hi> 9.8.) <hi>And no oppreſſour ſhall paſſe through them any more, for now I have ſeene with mine eyes,</hi> that is, I have exactly ſeene, I have taken perfect notice of them and their oppreſſours, &amp; I will in juſtice ſo oppreſſe their unjuſt oppreſſours, that they ſhall be rid of them for ever, <hi>No oppreſſour ſhall paſſe through them any more.</hi> Wee may make a threefold difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Eye of God upon the perſons or wayes of men.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Eye of God is upon the wayes of men, to obſerve what they doe, his eye diſtinguiſheth between good and evill, and diſcerneth, as much as beholdeth what is done; His ſeeing the wayes of men is a cleare underſtanding of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Eye of God is upon the wayes of men to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper and bleſſe them in what they doe well. The eye of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the righteous implyeth, yea and conveigheth mercy to the righteous.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Eye of God is upon the wayes of men, to pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and chaſten them for what they doe amiſſe. God hath a vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive,
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:153845:339"/> or a revengeing eye, as well as an intuitive or a beholding eye. This eye of God is upon all the wayes of wicked men, though for a time hee giveth them to be in ſafety, wherein they reſt. And becauſe God ſeeth the wayes both of the righteous and the wicked, therefore God commandeth us to <hi>ſay to the righteous it ſhall be well with them, for they ſhall eate the fruit of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Wo to the wicked, it ſhall be ill with him, for the reward of his hands ſhall be given him.</hi> Every man ſhall receave from the hand of God, according to what God hath ſeene with his eye.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Wee may take theſe words as an admiring Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, like that (<hi>ver.</hi> 12.) <hi>Yet God layeth not folly to them.</hi> They doe fooliſhly, yet God doth not deale with them according to their folly; ſo here they doe wickedly, <hi>yet his eyes are upon their wayes.</hi> As if he had ſayd, it is a wonderfull thing, even matter of aſtoniſhment, that God who ſo exactly ſeeth and knoweth the wayes of wicked men, ſhould ſuffer them to be an houre in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Is it not a wonder that God ſhould ſuffer them to live long and ſafely, ſinning, who deſerve to dye for every ſin? As all wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men who dye impoenitently dye in their ſins, ſo God ſuffers many wicked men to ſin till they dye; he ſeeth their wayes and will not ſtop them, till they have run their full courſe. Here is the patience and long ſuffering of God. Men ſinne to a wonder, when they goe onne in ſin after many ſmitings; as the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains by his Prophet (<hi>Amo:</hi> 4.) <hi>I ſmote them with the peſtilence, &amp; with the ſword,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet have they not returned unto mee ſaith the Lord.</hi> Now as it aggravates mans ſin, to ſin under wrath and ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſo it hightens the goodneſſe and patience of God to admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he doth not ſmite men in their ſin, ſeing he beholds them in their ſin. <hi>His Eyes are upon their wayes to behold every ſin,</hi> and every ſin is not onely diſpleaſing but burdenſome and grievous to him. What a miracle of patience doth this diſcover in God? The Prophet <hi>Habackuk</hi> moves the Lord to revenge, and wonders how hee could hold his hand from puniſhing, while his eye beheld that done which was ſo diſpleaſing. (<hi>Hab.</hi> 1.12, 13.) <hi>Art not thou from everlaſting O Lord my God, mine holy one? wee ſhall not dye, thou haſt ordained them for Judgement, and O God thou haſt ſtabliſhed them for Correction. Thou art of purer Eyes then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold evill, and canſt not looke on iniquity. Wherefore lookeſt thou on
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:153845:340"/> them that deale treacherouſly, and holdeſt thy tongue, when the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked devoureth the man that is more righteous then he?</hi> As if he had ſayd, Lord, I know thou beholdeſt all the Evill in the world, and art of purer eyes then to behold it with any delight or approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now ſeeing it is ſo, <hi>why then doeſt thou looke on them that deale treacherouſly?</hi> In the former part of the verſe he ſayd, <hi>Thou canſt not looke on iniquity,</hi> and in the latter he ſaith, <hi>why doeſt thou looke on them that deale treacherouſly?</hi> There is a twofold looke of God; Firſt, (as was toucht before) a looke of approbation; ſecondly, a looke of patience. And ſo the meaning of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is, ſeeing, O Lord, thou canſt not looke upon ſin approvingly, why doeſt thou looke upon it patiently? <hi>And holdeſt thy tongue when the wicked devoure the righteous.</hi> As if he had ſaid, How is it (Lord) that thou doeſt not breake forth into the ſevereſt rebukes againſt them? How is it that they have not ſo much (to appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) as a frowne or an ill word from thee, who have deſerved blowes and utter breakings? Indeed if God had but the patience of all Creatures, had he but the patience of men and Angels, the ſin of man would ſpend it out in one day: God could not hold his tongue nor his hand an houre, Conſidering, that he clearely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth all the wickednes that is in the wayes of men, and that every the leaſt unevennes as well as wickednes is extreamly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to him, were not his Infinite patience; God could not hold but deſtroy all the wicked of the world, or all that world which lyeth in wickednes, were it not that hee is reſolved to magnifie his patience. And though for reaſons knowne to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, hee beares with thoſe that are burdenſome to him very long, not onely many dayes but yeares, yet the time is at hand when he will bring them to Judgement, and Judge them according to thoſe wayes upon which his eyes have been. <hi>Then the wicked ſhall finde that as the eyes of God have been upon all their wayes, ſo that he hath not at all, or not in the leaſt been pleaſed with any of them.</hi>

                  <hi>JOb</hi> ſtill proceedeth to deſcribe, and here concludeth his deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the ſtate of wicked men, he hath (as hath been ſhewed in the expoſition of the former part of the Chapter) drawne the blackeſt character of their wickedneſſe, as alſo given the fayreſt proſpect of their outward happineſſe; They ſin and proſper, they ſin and are ſafe, they have much good while they doe much evill.</p>
               <p>This text ſpeakes againe of their proſperity, yet with a diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>they are exalted</hi> (but it is onely) <hi>for a little while, for they are gone and brought low, they are taken out of the way as all others, and cut off as the tops of the eares of Corne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two opinions concerning the general ſcope of theſe words.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Some conceive that <hi>Jobs</hi> aime is to ſhew, that both in life, and death, wicked men fare like other men; <hi>They are exalted for a little while, as all others are, they are gone, brought low, and taken out of the way as all others are.</hi>

               <p>Yet, ſecondly, I rather incline that he here intends to ſet forth the miſerable concluſion of wicked men, not onely as they are cut off from worldly enjoyments, as all men ſooner or latter are, but as they are cut off from worldly enjoyments in a way which is not common to other men, or which is not the common way of man. And the reaſon why I rather incline to this as <hi>Jobs</hi> ſcope, is, becauſe theſe various expreſſions of the ſame thing, <hi>they are gone, they are brought low, they are taken out of the way, they are cut off</hi> (theſe various expreſſions, I ſay) ſeeme to carry ſomewhat more then the remove of men out of the world, by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way of dying, or then by a naturall death.</p>

                  </p>
                  <q>They are exalted.</q>
                  <p>The word may be applyed to a twofold exaltation; firſt, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward exaltation by pride; ſome riſe within, faſter then they riſe without, yea there are ſome that riſe very high within, when they are caſt very <hi>low without;</hi> they exalt and lift up themſelves in pride of ſpirit, though they are caſt downe in ſtate. The word is often applyed to note pride or haughtineſſe. (<hi>Micah</hi> 2.3.) <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, behold againſt this family doe I deviſe an evill, from which ye ſhall not remove your necks, neither ſhall ye goe haughtily.</hi> The word is, <hi>ye ſhall not goe in your height,</hi> in your altitudes, as ye have done, the caſe ſhall be altered with you, and the Tables tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; <hi>for this is an evill time,</hi> that is, an evill time to you, a time of calling you to an account about, and of puniſhing you for all your wickednes, and eſpecially for your pride. As ye have made it an evill time by your ſin, ſo ye ſhall finde it to be an evill time to and by your ſmart And this hight of ſpirit often breakes forth, and is ſignified in height of action, or in haughty poſtures, <hi>The lifting up of the head, the ſtretching out of the neck,</hi> Thus (Iſa. 2.11.) <hi>The lofty looks of man ſhall be humbled.</hi> The heart looks out at the eye, the lofty heart makes a lofty looke; according to the frame of the heart, is the caſt of the eye; the eye is not proud, but as it is inſtructed, and tutoured by the heart, ſo it acts proudly, and looks haughtily. And thus they alwayes act, who though they are not exalted, yet have a minde to exalt themſelves, who when
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:153845:341"/> others caſt no honour upon them, yet they will take it, and reach after it. Thus the word is applicable to internal ſelfe-exaltation, as well as to external exaltation, or exaltation by others. For as many are outwardly humbled, who are not at all humble: and as ſome are inwardly humbled, who are not at all outwardly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, (they have an humble lowly frame of heart, and are active in humbling of themſelves) ſo many are inwardly exalted, who never had nor deſerved, in the leaſt, any outward exaltation. They are active to exalt themſelves, whom no man beſides themſelves, thinks worthy to be exalted. The men of whom <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes were doubtleſſe forward enough to exalt themſelves, yet</p>
                  <p>I underſtand him rather ſpeaking of their outward exaltation. For <hi>Job</hi> is here deſcribing the proſperity of wicked men, not their pride. Though, we know, proſperity is the occaſion of pride, and men uſually grow high-minded, when they grow high in the world. As by pride cometh contention, ſo by exaltation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth pride.</p>
                  <q>They are exalted.</q>
                  <p>That is, they are great, and rich, they are promoted to honour, and ſet uppermoſt among men.</p>

                     <hi>They are exalted a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</hi> But the word is taken two wayes in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For <hi>little in degree,</hi> or <hi>for a little deale</hi> (as we ſay) that is, for a thing that is little (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.16.) <hi>A little that a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man hath, is better then the riches of many wicked;</hi> His mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel is better then the others feaſt; his penny is better then the wicked mans pound. Thus <hi>Jonathan</hi> ſpake (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.29.) when <hi>Saul</hi> had given that ſevere charge that no man ſhould eate till the Sun went downe; <hi>My father hath troubled the land, ſee I pray you how my eyes are inlightened, becauſe I taſted a little of this honey;</hi> As if he had ſayd, I did not eat much, not ſo much as to delight my ſelfe, much leſſe ſo much as to glut my ſelfe, I did eate but a drop or two, and mine eyes are wonderfully inlightned, that is, my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are much refreſhed and cheared, for naturally, when a man is faint, his eye-ſight fayles.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For a <hi>little in time,</hi> or for a ſhort ſpace of time
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:153845:342"/> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.10.) <hi>For yet a little while and the wicked ſhall not be, yea, thou ſhalt diligently conſider his place, and he ſhall not be,</hi> that is, he ſhall not be in power, he ſhall not flouriſh in worldly pompe many dayes. The birth of his proſperity ſhall not be farre in time from the death of it, nor the grave of all his glory from the cradle of it. So (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.5.) <hi>Thou haſt made him a little lower then the Angels;</hi> which prophecy of Chriſt is cited (<hi>Heb</hi> 2.7.) Now Chriſt was not made a little lower then the Angels in degree; For he was the Lord of the Angels, and when God brought him <hi>his firſt begotten into the world, he ſayd, And let all the Angels of God worſhip him.</hi> But Chriſt was made lower then the Angels for a little time; And ſo we put in the margin, <hi>Thou madeſt him a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while inferior to the Angels.</hi> Namely, for the while or time when he was abaſed by death and lay in the grave; yet we may ſay alſo that Chriſt was made <hi>a little lower then the Angels</hi> in his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon him our nature; The Angelicall nature being higher then the humane, as conſidered in it ſelfe. We may expound the word here in eyther ſence, <hi>they are exalted a little,</hi> that is, firſt, they have a little exaltation; ſecondly, how great ſoever we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave their exaltation to be, yet they are exalted but for a little while or time. We reſtraine the word to this laſt ſence, as refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the ſpace of time, wherein the wicked are aloft; <hi>They are exalted for a little while.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>The exaltation of wicked men ſhall not continue.</q>
                  <p>They may be high built, but they have not a ſure foundation, they may floate aloft, but they have no conſiſtance below, they are as vapours riſing from the earth, or as meteors hanging in the ayre, both which are lifted up onely for a little while, and are gone. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſaid concerning the wrathful reigne of <hi>Julian the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, Let us be quiet, it is a little cloud which will ſoone paſſe away.</hi> The wicked mans civil honor is but <hi>a vapour</hi> (as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of the natural life of every man) <hi>that appeareth for a litle time, and then vaniſheth away.</hi> The exaltation of wicked men, is but for a little while; For, firſt, their exaltation is uſually but for a part of their lives, and that the leſſer part; and that cannot (upon any reckoning) be more then a little while. Secondly, their longeſt and utmoſt exaltation can be but for their lives, and the whole life
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:153845:342"/> of man is but a little while. <hi>David</hi> taking the exacteſt meaſure of his life, ſaith, <hi>Behold, thou haſt made my dayes as an hand breadth, and mine age is nothing before thee</hi> (Pſal. 39.5.) The whole life of man is very ſhort, and the preferment, or exaltation of wicked men is eyther much ſhorter then their lives, or their lives are much ſhortned by their exaltation. They act their power beyond the bounds of Juſtice, and ſo forfeit their lives, before they come neere the bounds of nature. Now if life laſt but a little, and they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted but a little while of their lives, or if their lives be cut off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a while after they are exalted, then they have but little exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Many ſpend a great part of their life before they arrive at exaltation, or preferment in this world, and there are many who out-live their owne exaltation, and there are not a few, who looſe their lives by the abuſe of their exaltation. The worldly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all men are ſhort, and evill mens enjoyments are ſhorteſt. Saints ſhall have enjoyments hereafter commenſurate with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but the beſt of Saints here, have neyther any leaſe of their lives, nor of their enjoyments. And if it be ſo with the beſt of men, then much more with the worſt of men, who as they are wrapt up in the common condition of humane fraylety, with all other men, ſo they lye under ſome peculiar curſes or threatnings which other men doe not. And how ſoone may a curſe caſt thoſe downe who are moſt highly exalted, and blaſt or wither all their beauty and bravery, whoſe branches are greeneſt, and whoſe faces ſhine brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt with earthly ſplendour.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Foraſmuch as the word ſignifyeth a little thing, as well as a little time, a little deale, as well as a little while, a thing which in regard of the ſmalnes of it, is inconſiderable as well as that which in regard of the weakenes of it, is not durable.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>The greateſt exaltation that any man can have in the things of this world is but a little exaltation.</q>
                  <p>That man is but little exalted, how much ſoever he is exalted, who is onely exalted in the things of this world; That which is but little in it ſelfe, cannot make us very great, though we ſhould have it all as ours, or in our poſſeſſion. How little a thing is all this world, and how little a part hath any one of this little? The whole world is but little, what then is a little part of it? which yet
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:153845:343"/> is all that falls to the ſhare of the greateſt men in this world. Philoſophers ſay that the whole body of the earth and Sea toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is but as a poynt or pricke with a pen compared to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; and yet there are very few of the great men of the earth, who poſſeſſe ſo much as a mathematicall poynt or pricke with a pen in the body of the earth. Wee may ſay, that the day of the greateſt man in the world, is but a <hi>day of ſmall things.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to encourage the meane beginnings of <hi>Sions</hi> deliverance (<hi>Zech.</hi> 4.10.) ſayd, <hi>Who hath deſpiſed the day of ſmall things?</hi> As if he had ſayd, I know many doe it, ſome hoping and others fearing that theſe ſmall beginnings will have ſmaller endings, or end in nothing, but in the joy of the enemies, and in the ſorrow and diſappoyntment of the friends of <hi>Sion;</hi> But I ſay unto you, take heed of deſpiſing <hi>the day of ſmall things,</hi> that is, the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of deliverance and ſalvation to <hi>Sion.</hi> Now as we are not to deſpiſe the workes of God, becauſe they are ſmall, ſo we have no reaſon to be proud of, but even to deſpiſe the things of the world, for they are ſmall. Men have great thoughts and make much adoe about ſmall things, when they have to doe with the greateſt things on this ſide heaven. <hi>The greateſt things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue onely for a little while, are but tittle worth, then how little worth are thoſe things, which beſides that they continue but a little while, are themſelves but little?</hi> Though wicked men are exalted, yet no man hath cauſe to be troubled at it, or envy them; They are not bleſſed becauſe exalted, for they are exalted but a little, and that onely for a little while. It ſhould not be much to us what any man is as to worldly enjoyments, no nor what we our ſelves are as thoſe enjoyments, ſeeing whatſoever others are, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we are in that capacity, is but for a little while. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18.) <hi>We looke not at the things which are ſeene, but at the things which are not ſeene;</hi> that is, we make not the things of the world our ſcope, but the things which lye beyond this world, which are ſeene by faith onely; And the reaſon why he looked not at theſe things which are ſeene, was becauſe the things that are ſeene are temporall; <hi>thoſe things which are ſeene, will not be long ſeene,</hi> they are but for a while, and therefore not to be much looked after. <hi>The Things which are not ſeene ſhall be ſeene for ever,</hi> they are eternal, and therefore moſt worthy to be looked after. The world hath beauty and glory in it, but this
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:153845:343"/> ſtaines the beauty of all earthly glory, that it may be ſo quickly ſtained. The evills and troubles of this world, ſhould not much trouble us, nor the afflictions of this world preſent much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict us, becauſe they are but for a while; ſuppoſe a godly man be caſt downe, and laid low in reference to the world, he is laid low but for a while, therefore no great matter to him, he hath no great reaſon to be troubled at it; as the Apoſtle argueth in the ſame Chapter (<hi>ver.</hi> 16.) <hi>For this cauſe we faint not, for our light af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions which are but for a moment,</hi> &amp;c. therefore he calls them light, how great and how heavy ſoever in their owne nature, though they were as heavy as a mountaine, he calls them light, becauſe as to their duration they were but for a moment. We ſay, A light thing carryed a great way or a great while becometh heavy: He that puts onely a pound-ſtone in his pocket, will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſencible of and much burdened with the weight of it, before he comes to the end of a long journey; whereas a great weight is not much burdenſome, if it be not much borne. Now as worldly evills and troubles are light, becauſe but ſhort, ſo are worldly comforts and honours, eſpecially the worldly comforts &amp; honours of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men; of whom it is expreſſely ſayd, not onely by way of aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (in which ſenſe it may be ſayd of all men) but alſo by way of commination, <hi>They are exalted for a little while.</hi> Againe, as the profeſſion of hypocrites, hath a kinde of appearing goodlineſſe and beauty, but it is little worth, or it is of no worth, becauſe they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure but for a little while, they are but Temporyes, as the word is in the parable of the Sower. Or as the Lord complaineth by his Prophet (<hi>Hoſ:</hi> 6.4.) <hi>O Ephraim, what ſhall I doe unto thee, O Judah, what ſhall I doe unto thee, for your goodneſſe is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew, it goeth away;</hi> goodneſſe it ſelfe is ſcarce good, goodneſſe is little worth, if it be but as a morning cloud, if it be but as the dew that goeth away when the heate of the Sunne commeth. The worth and glory of true grace ſtands in this, that it ſtands and endures for ever; let the world turne which way it will, true grace ſtands its ground and turnes not away. Now if all the goodneſſe and pretended holynes of hypocrites and forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts be nothing worth, becauſe it is (like a cloud, or a dew) onely for a little while; how little worth is the exaltation of wicked men, which goeth away, and is as quickly gone, as a cloud is ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and blowne away by the wind, or a dew exhaled by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:153845:344"/> Sunne. We may ſay of all the glory of the wicked, as the ſame Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſayth of <hi>Ephraim</hi> (Chap. 9.11.) <hi>As for Ephraim, their glory ſhall flee away like a bird from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception;</hi> that is, it ſhall quickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part; <hi>by their glory,</hi> ſome underſtand their children; As if he had ſayd, <hi>Their children ſhall flee from the birth;</hi> that is, if borne alive they ſhall dye as ſoone as borne; <hi>Their children ſhall flee from the wombe;</hi> that is, they ſhall not be borne alive, they ſhall be abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; <hi>Their children ſhall flee from the conception;</hi> that is, they ſhall not be ſo much as conceived. Wee may read the Prophet backward, and beginning with the laſt firſt, ſay; <hi>Their glory,</hi> that is, their children, or whatſoever elſe they glory in and make their glory, <hi>ſhall flee from conception;</hi> that is, it ſhall not be conceaved, or have any being at all, and if conceived and ſo have a being, yet it <hi>ſhall flee from the wombe,</hi> that is, it ſhall never come to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate being, but ſhall be marr'd in the making; or if it be borne and ſo have a perfect being, yet <hi>it ſhall flee from the birth,</hi> that is, it ſhall dye as ſoone as borne, and come to its grave in ſtead of or as ſoon as to a cradle. Thus he deſcribes the evill that ſhall come upon all their glory, it ſhall ſuddenly fly away, and this ſpoyles the beauty of all that earthly glory, with which the wicked ſhine; <hi>They are exalted for a little while.</hi> This ſuddaine vaniſhing of the wicked mans glory is further deſcribed in foure expreſſions; firſt, <hi>they are gone;</hi> ſecondly, <hi>brought low;</hi> thirdly, <hi>they are taken out of the way;</hi> fourthly, <hi>they are cut off as the top of the eares of Corne.</hi>

The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>James</hi> ſayth (<hi>Chap.</hi> 1.9, 10.) <hi>Let the Brother of low degree rejoyce, in that he is exalted; But the rich, in that he is made low;</hi> A poore brother, or a brother of low degree ſeemes to be farre from exaltation; yet he hath cauſe to rejoyce in that he is exalted; and he is doubly exalted; firſt, as he is a brother to the Saints, and a member of Chriſt; ſecondly, as he is a ſufferer, or afflicted for Chriſt. Every godly man of the loweſt degree is exalted in one of theſe wayes, and many of them in both; and any man hath cauſe to rejoyce in theſe ſpiritual honours and exaltations, how low ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he is in temporals. But how is the rich, or the brother of high degree made low? and why ſhould he rejoyce in that he is made low? for though there are readings of the text by a ſupply of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words, yet I judge that to be the beſt; But why ſhould <hi>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in that he is made low?</hi> As the poore mans exaltation before ſpoken of, is ſpirituall, ſo alſo is the rich mans humiliation. The rich man hath great cauſe to rejoyce when he is ſpiritually hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and made low in his owne eyes, when he is higheſt in the eye of the world. To be made low in our owne eyes, or in the ſence of our owne ſinfullnes while we are rich and outwardly exalted, is a great worke of Grace; But to be brought low by the hand of God, while we are high and exalted in the eyes of men, and in our owne eyes, is the puniſhment of ſin. Godly Great men are made low in their owne thoughts by grace. Wicked men though never ſo great, ſhall be brought low in the ſight of others for their ſin. <hi>They are exalted for a little while, but are gone, and brought low.</hi>

                  <p>Now they are exalted and lifted up, within a while they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and caſt downe. The providences of God ring the changes of mens eſtates all the world over.

So the eſtates and conditions of the ſame men differ as much at ſeverall times; They who were

Thus the hils are turned into valleyes, and the higheſt mountaines, that is, men as high and ſtrong as mountaines (as we read in the Prophecy of <hi>Zechary</hi> (Chap. 4.7.) become plaines. Our ſpirituall eſtate is like mount <hi>Sion,</hi> which ſhall never be removed, 'tis founded upon a rocke that can never be ſhaken; But Temporal things are like a wheele which moves continually, and that ſpoke which is now aloft (as that Captive King ſayd to his Conquerour) is quickly turned to the ground, <hi>and brought low.</hi> The Apoſtle gives an excellent caution in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to our ſpirituall eſtate (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12.) <hi>Let him that think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he ſtandeth take heed leſt he fall.</hi> And I may ſay in reference to any mans temporal eſtate, He that is ſureſt of his ſtanding, may fall not-withſtanding all his heed.

                  <p>High eſtates have no ſecurity in them, yea they are leſſe ſecure, then the loweſt eſtate; and that not onely becauſe they are more ſubject to the envy of men, but becauſe they who are in high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces make themſelves more lyable to the wrath of God.

The righteous pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh</hi> (that is, dye, ſayth the Prophet) <hi>and no man layeth it to heart, and mercifull men are taken away,</hi> they are taken away upon that account which few conſider, <hi>even from the evill to come,</hi> (Iſa. 57.1, 2.)

By whom ſhall the bloody enemies be brought downe, for they are high? by whom ſhall our oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours be deſtroyed, for they are ſtrong? Such are the reaſonings and queſtionings of our feare and unbeliefe. The text and poynt
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:153845:347"/> make anſwer; <hi>They ſhall be taken away as all others,</hi> even as the weakeſt and the meaneſt in the world; it puts God to no more trouble, to pull the ſtrongeſt Princes out of their Pallaces, Forts, or Caſtles, when they ſtand in his way, &amp; hinder his deſignes, then to turne a beggar out of his cottage, or houſe of Hurdles. Such a ſcorne is put upon the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> (Iſa. 14.10.) <hi>All they ſhall ſpeake, and ſay unto thee, Art thou alſo become weake as we? art thou become like unto us?</hi> Thou thoughteſt thy ſelfe impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in power, and thou didſt looke upon us as contemptible weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, but now thou art become weake as we. While God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſpeakes great things of Magiſtrates, and lifts them up as it were beyond the ſtate of man, he yet with the ſame breath, makes them in one thing but paralel with all other men; ye rule or have power over others like God, but in your ſelves ye are as weake and mortal as any other ſort of men (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 82.6.) <hi>I have ſayd ye are Gods, and all of you are children of the moſt high, but ye ſhall dye like men,</hi> like the common ſort of men, <hi>and ye ſhall fall like one of the Princes.</hi> Or rather, by much, as ſome render the Hebrew, <hi>and the Princes ſhall dye as one,</hi> or, <hi>as any one;</hi> that is, as any ordinary man; For indeed there appeares no argument in the words reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſcope of the place, according to our tranſlation, to ſay, That Magiſtrates ſhall <hi>fall like one of the Princes,</hi> is no abatement to them, but to ſay, Princes ſhall fall like any one, is a great abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and fall to them, and fully reacheth the ſence of the preſent obſervation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Theſe words, <hi>as all others,</hi> are expounded of other things, that is, as all worldly things.</p>

We are alwayes dying, and ſo is all that we have; ours are dying comforts,
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:153845:347"/> dying riches, dying honours, ours is dying ſtrength, dying beauty. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.6.) <hi>All fleſh is graſſe, and the goodlynes thereof is as the flower of the feild;</hi> If all things we have be but a flower, and wee our ſelves but graſſe, then, we are taken away as all other things; for flowers and graſſe are alike eaſily taken away.</p>

Here it is applyed eyther to the common way of cutting off <hi>by death,</hi> or to a cutting off by Judgement, both which may be comprehended under the following ſimilitude; <hi>They are cut off</hi>
                     <q>As the tops of the eares of Corne.</q>
                  </p>

                     <hi>as the eares of corne which grow upon the top of the ſtraw.</hi> Where (by the way) the reader may take notice, that the word which we render, <hi>Eares of Corne,</hi> is that hard word which coſt the lives of ſo many <hi>Ephraimites</hi> (Judg. 12.6.) Every man that eſcaped <hi>was bid ſay Shibboleth, and he ſayd Sibboleth, for he could not frame to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it right; Then they tooke him and ſlew him.</hi> The <hi>Gileadites</hi> cut off all thoſe <hi>Ephraimites</hi> who could not rightly pronounce this word, that ſignifies <hi>eares of Corne;</hi> And here <hi>Job</hi> ſaith that all wicked men <hi>are cut off as the tops of the eares of Corne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſimilitude (as ſome expound it) ſets forth nothing elſe but the fayrneſſe and eaſines of the death of wicked men, as hath been ſhewed before; <hi>They are cut off as the tops of the eares of corne,</hi> that is, they dye as corne when it is fully ripe, at a full age. Thus <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpake to <hi>Job</hi> by way of promiſe in caſe of his returne to God (<hi>Chap.</hi> 5.26.) <hi>Thou ſhalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a ſhoke of corne commeth in his ſeaſon.</hi> But <hi>to be cut off like the tops of the eares of corne,</hi> ſeemes rather to imply a violent death, and ſounds much more like a Threatning then a promiſe: Therefore</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To be <hi>cut off like the tops of the eares of corne,</hi> ſhewes how eaſily wicked men may be cut off by death or Judgement, rather
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:153845:348"/> then the eaſines of their death, when they are cut off. How quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may an eare of corne be cut off? wicked men who ſeeme as ſtrong as oakes, ſhall be cut off like ſtrawes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It ſhewes that wicked men are uſually cut off by a violent death, eares of corne are cut off by the reapers ſickle, they doe not fall off alone: and though a wicked man dye a naturall death, yet there is a violence in it; he is <hi>cut off</hi> when he dyeth in his bed as wel as when he dyeth upon the block; a naturall death, is a kinde of violent death to every man who is unwilling to dye. Such a man doth not reſigne up his ſoule into the hand of God, but his ſoule is rent and raviſhed from him. Chriſt ſaith of the rich man, though dying in his bed (for ſo the parable is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.20.) <hi>Thou foole, this night thy ſoule ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of thee, or this night doe they require thy ſoule from thee.</hi> It may be queſtioned, who ſhall require it? he doth not meane, that murtherers ſhould kill him, but that when he dyed his ſoule ſhould rather be taken by force, then quietly ſurrendred.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>He ſhall be cut off as the heads or tops of the eares of corne,</hi> may note his deſtruction when fulleſt and higheſt. For as the eares of corne are better then the ſtraw (what is the ſtraw to the eare?) ſo there be ſome eares of corne that be <hi>head or chiefe eares;</hi> ſo that to ſay wicked men ſhall <hi>be cut off as the head of the eares of corne,</hi> is to ſay they ſhall be cut off in their fullneſſe, in their hight and glory. When the wicked are not onely eares, but heads of the eares of corne, when they are at the higheſt, they ſhall dye; and this reſemblance holds not onely becauſe ſome eares are head-eares, fuller and higher then others, but becauſe all corne is cut, when once it comes to a head, that is, to a perfect fullnes.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, To be <hi>cut off as the tops of the eares of corne,</hi> may alſo ſignifie that there is a ſpeciall time or ſeaſon, when wicked men are to be cut off; For as corne is not alwayes ripe for the ſickle, ſo wicked men (though they alwayes deſerve, yet) are not alwayes ripe for Judgement; Corne is not cut downe when greene, or when grown high, but when it is ripe &amp; fit for the flaile, it is cut in its ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; wicked men ſhall be cut off in their ſeaſon. And as there is a general ſeaſon for the harveſt of the whole world, ſo for every man in particular. (<hi>Rev:</hi> 14.15.) <hi>Thruſt in thy ſickle and reape, for the time is come for thee to reape, for the harveſt of the earth is ripe,</hi> God will not command the Angel to put in his ſickle till the world be
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:153845:348"/> ripe for Judgement, as he ſpake alſo by the Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> (Ch. 3.13, 14.) <hi>Put in thy ſickle for the harveſt is ripe, come get you downe for the preſſe is full, the fats overflow, for their wickednes is great, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, multitudes in the valley of deciſion, for the day of the Lord is neere, in the valley of deciſion;</hi> that is, in the valley of cutting downe, or of cutting off; or as we put in the Margin, <hi>in the valley of conciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or threſhing;</hi> When the wicked ſhall be <hi>cut off as the tops of the eares of corne,</hi> by the ſickle of divine wrath, and be under dreadfull breakings and threſhings for evermore.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, This cutting off <hi>as the tops of the eares of corne,</hi> ſhewes that God doth not cut off wicked men when he hath them at an advantage, when they are weake, when they are low, but when they are as the <hi>tops of the eares of corne,</hi> when they are at their beſt, then he doth it; the chiefe of the people are called <hi>the heads of the people,</hi> (Numb. 25.4.) <hi>hang up the heads of the people before me,</hi> ſayth God, by <hi>Moſes,</hi> he cut them off who were as the heads of the eares of corne. As ſome Tyrants for feare, So God in Juſtice cuts off the heads of the people, the chiefe of Familyes, Princes, and great men.

                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>We ſhould freely offer our opinions and aſſertions to the tryall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis too much for a man to looke that what he hath ſayd ſhould be conſented unto and beleeved, becauſe <hi>he hath ſayd it.</hi> Onely God himſelfe is worthy and may demand, to be thus beleeved by man. That God ſaith this or that is enough to perſwade, yea to require our faith in it, and obedience to it. When God ſpeakes, <hi>he that hath eares to heare, let him heare</hi> (Math. 13.9.) that is, let him beleeve and obey, at his perill be it. He that is truth cannot but ſpeake truth, and therefore is to be beleeved in whatſoever he ſpeaketh. Man ought not to ſay any thing as queſtioning the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of what God hath ſayd. But we ought to conſider what men ſay, and not to beleeve beyond what we have tryed. And as no man ought to beleeve before he hath tryed, ſo every man ought to preſent what he hath ſayd to the tryall. Man hath no dominion over the faith of another; <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſed he had not (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:153845:349"/> 24.) and if <hi>Paul</hi> had not who hath? dares any man pretend to a higher priviledge then <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe did? Wee may not bind up the conſciences of men to our dictates any further then what we ſay is grounded upon and anſwerable to the ſayings of God. To the Law and to the Teſtimony, if we ſpeake not according to this word, ye have leave or may take leave to ſay (as to that ſaying) there is no light in us (<hi>Iſ:</hi> 8.20.) We muſt not teach magiſterially, but miniſterially, we muſt not affect <hi>to be called Maſters, for one is our Maſter even Chriſt</hi> (Mat. 23.10.) <hi>The Beraeans receaved the word with all readines of mind,</hi> yet they did not ſwallow downe all whole that was ſayd to them, but <hi>ſearched the Scriptures dayly whether thoſe things ware ſo</hi> (Act. 17.11.) The Apoſtles rule is ſutable to their practice (1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.21.) <hi>Prove all things, hold faſt that which is good.</hi> Now as it is the duty of hearers and learners to hold nothing till they have proved it, ſo it is the duty of Teachers to offer every doctrine to the ballance or tryall which they deſire others ſhould hold.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, While <hi>Job</hi> doth thus confidently offer his aſſertion to tryall; We learne, That
<q>Truth is not affrayd to be tryed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Truth often lieth in a corner, but truth doth not ſeeke corners, truth never hides her head, as aſhamed to be ſeene or diſcuſſed by men. Truth (as ſome have ſayd) lyeth in a deepe pit, it is hard to finde it out, it lieth out of ſight, yet truth doth not hide it ſelfe, but dares ſtand forth in the face of all the world; truth no more feares the triall, then pure gold feares the touchſtone, or then a ſchollar who hath made good progreſſe in his learning, feares to be examined; <hi>He that hath truth with him needs not care who appeares againſt him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In that he ſayth, <hi>if it be not ſo now, who will make me a liar?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>Falſe doctrine is a lye.</q>
                  <p>(Iſa. 9.15.) <hi>The antient, and the honourable he is the head, the Prophet that teacheth lies,</hi> that is, (the Prophet that teacheth falſe doctrine) <hi>he is the tayle.</hi> (Jer. 9.3.) <hi>They bend their tongues like their bowes for lies, but they are not valiant for the truth on the earth.</hi>
                     <pb n="672" facs="tcp:153845:350"/> The Prophet (as I conceave) intends not ſo much falſehood in diſcourſe, which we call <hi>telling a lye,</hi> as falſehood of doctrine, which we call <hi>teaching of lyes. They bend their tongues (as bows) for lies,</hi> that is, they ſet themſelves to the maintaining of falſe doctrine to the utmoſt ſtretch of their wit and words. Againe, ſaith the Lord (<hi>Jer.</hi> 14.14.) <hi>The Prophets that prophecy lyes in my name, I ſent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither ſpake unto them, they prophecy unto you a falſe divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart.</hi> The whole doctrine of the man of ſin is called <hi>a lye. Becauſe they received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved, therefore God gave them up to ſtrong deluſion that they ſhould beleive a lye</hi> (2 Theſ. 2.11.) All the faith-devouring and conſcience-waſting errors that ever the man of ſin vented to the world, are wrapt up in this <hi>one ſyllable,</hi> or <hi>word, a lye.</hi> He that receaveth a lye that is told, wrongeth others by it, but he that receaved a lye that is taught wrongeth himſelfe moſt by it. To tell a lye is very ſinfull, but to teach a lye, is much more ſinfull. The evill of that ſin is greateſt which ſpreadeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt, &amp; continueth longeſt. A lye that is told and received ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not long in the memory, but paſſeth away for the moſt part like a tale that is told, and it is enough to many a man that telleth a lye, if he be beleeved but a little while; But a lye that is taught and receaved ſticketh long in the underſtanding, and abideth there like a nayle faſtned by the Maſters of the aſſemblyes, and it is not enough to him that teacheth a lye, unleſſe it be beleeved for ever.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When <hi>Job</hi> ſayth, <hi>Who will make me a liar?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>The worſt thing that can be proved againſt any man, is, that he is a lyar.</q>
                  <p>To be a lyar is to be as bad as may be; For it is to be as bad as the Devill; He deceaved the woman both by telling and teaching a lye (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.) <hi>He abode not in the truth, becauſe there is no truth in him, when he ſpeaketh a lye he ſpeaketh of his owne, for he is a lyar and the father of it</hi> (Joh. 6.44.) Every ſin is of the Devill, both by temptation and approbation, but onely ſome ſinnes are of the Devill by way of practice, and the ſin which is chiefely of him by practice is lying. Now, every ſin the more congeniall it is to the
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:153845:350"/> Devill, the more ſinfull &amp; abominable it is. And therefore among thoſe who ſhall be without, <hi>lye-makers</hi> are chiefe (<hi>Rev.</hi> 22.15.) <hi>Without are doggs, and ſorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and Idolaters, and whoſoever loveth and maketh a lye.</hi> The univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of this excluſion is onely expreſſed upon lyars, as if he had ſayd, <hi>to be ſure all lyars ſhall be without.</hi> He that maketh a lye hath nothing worſe to make; and he that maketh (that is, proveth) a man to be a lyar, hath nothing worſe to make of him.</p>
                  <q>And make my ſpeech nothing worth.</q>
                  <p>The Hebrew is, <hi>And bring my ſpeech to nothing;</hi>

                     <hi>The ſpeech of a lyar is nothing worth,</hi> ſound doctrine is of great value, it is worth thouſands. <hi>David</hi> preferr'd the word of God before thouſands of Gold, and ſilver; every holy truth is the word of God eyther formally or vertually, eyther in termes or by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. The Apoſtle compares ſound doctrine to things of greateſt worth, even to Gold, ſilver, and pretious ſtones, and in the ſame place (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.12.) he compares unſound doctrine or doctrine unſutable to the foundation (which is Jeſus Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone) to wood, hay, ſtubble, which as they are things in their owne nature unconſiderable &amp; worthleſſe in compariſon of Gold, ſilver, and pretious ſtones, ſo, as to the buſienes upon which he there treates (a ſuitable <hi>building upon Chriſt</hi>) they are altogether worthleſſe. And if thoſe doctrines, which (becauſe of ſome errour in them) are unſutable to the foundation, are to be accounted but <hi>wood, hay, and ſtubble,</hi> how worthleſſe are thoſe doctrines, which (being altogether erroneous) are inconſiſtent with and quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow the foundation. Such doctrines are worthy of nothing but a dung-hill, being themſelves nothing but droſſe and dung. What is that worth to us, which is uſeleſſe to us? How worthleſſe then is that which is deſtructive to us? Every error is a Bable, a
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:153845:351"/> thing of no uſe, ſome errors are as poyſon, deadly in their uſe. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> doth not ſpare to ſay as much of them (2 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.1, 2.) while he calleth them <hi>damnable hereſies, which bring ſwift deſtruction upon the bringers of them in,</hi> or the broachers of them abroad; And if they bring deſtruction upon thoſe who bring them, they that receave them cannot be ſafe.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this poynt and Chapter, if erroneous doctrine be nothing worth, what are thoſe Bookes worth, which are full of erroneous doctrines? To print ſuch Bookes is but waſt of paines and paper, and when ſuch Bookes are printed the beſt improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that can be made of them, is to make them waſt paper. To buy them is waſt of money, and to read them, is (to moſt) but waſt of time. That ſpeech is not worth the hearing, nor is that booke worth the reading, which (as all erroneous bookes and ſpeeches are) is nothing worth. <hi>Job</hi> granted, that if any could make him a lyar, they, with the ſame paines, muſt needes make <hi>his ſpeech nothing worth.</hi> Upon this iſſue he ſhuts up his diſcourſe in anſwer to <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> nor durſt <hi>Eliphaz</hi> undertake him any more upon that iſſue, and therefore layeth downe the Bucklers and quits the feild; yet <hi>Bildad</hi> takes them up and makes a ſhort skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh with <hi>Job;</hi> but upon another poynt, as will appeare in the following Chapter.</p>

Though (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12.) <hi>we meaſuring our ſelves by our ſelves, and comparing our ſelves amongst our ſelves are not wiſe;</hi> Yet while we onely doe ſo we ſeeme very wiſe; But when once we compare our ſelves with God, O what ideots and poore ſimple things are we. What is our power when once wee contemplate the power of God? What is the dominion which any Prince of the earth hath when once he conſiders the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſoveraignty of God? What is the wiſdome of man, what the holineſſe of man, to the wiſedome and holineſſe of God?</p>
                  <q>Dominion and feare are with him.</q>
                  <p>More particularly, in that Dominion is here appropriated to God.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>Supreame power is proper unto God.</q>
                  <p>There is a dominion put into the hands of men: many have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and power, but originally all Dominion is Gods. In him is the ſeate and roote of power. <hi>David</hi> ſaith (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.11.) <hi>God hath ſpoken once, twice have I heard it, that power belongeth unto God.</hi> As my eare hath heard ſo my heart hath heard and conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this truth. And this power or dominion of God may be conſidered foure wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In the univerſality of it, (1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.12.) where <hi>David</hi> makes this confeſſion; <hi>Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reighneſt over all, and in thine hand is power and might, and in thine hand is to make great and to give ſtrength unto all.</hi> He that giveth ſtrength unto all, hath ſtrength over all, and his dominion is over all nations and perſons, not limited to this or that particular nation or perſon: yea he hath dominion not onely over all here below; but in heaven above; as <hi>Bildad</hi> ſpeakes a little after; <hi>He maketh
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:153845:353"/> peace in his high places.</hi> Chriſt is <hi>Prince of the Kings of the earth</hi> (Rev: 1.5.) <hi>He is Lord of Lords and King of Kings</hi> (Rev. 19.16.) that is, not onely a King or a Lord, excelling all other Kings and Lords, but alſo ruling them, or reighning over them: Kings are his Subjects.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, His is an abſolute dominion, that is, he governes by no law, but by his owne will: this kinde of dominion is proper un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God alone. He doth and he onely may governe by his owne will. <hi>Hee doth in heaven and earth what ever pleaſeth him.</hi> This was ſpoken of (<hi>Job</hi> 23.13.) <hi>Hee is in one minde, and who can turne him? and what his ſoule deſireth that hee doth.</hi> Hee doth not goe out of himſelfe for his rule, his owne deſire is his rule, all the deſires of God are holy, juſt, and righteous, and therefore his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and will may well be his rule. It is good that he ſhould have an abſolute dominion, and rule according to his owne will, who cannot will any thing, but what is good. And 'tis but juſt that he ſhould rule as he pleaſeth, who cannot be pleaſed with any thing but what is juſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, His is an everlaſting dominion (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.7.) As men are mortall, ſo are States, Kingdomes, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires. The ſtrongeſt and greateſt of them have had their fates and funerals. Wee ſee what changes there have been of dominion and power out of one hand into another; but the dominion of God is ſubject to no change, nor knoweth it any fate. <hi>The Babylonian, the Perſian, the Graecian, and the Roman Monarchyes have ſeene their day;</hi> but the dominion of Jeſus Chriſt is an everlaſting do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion (<hi>Dan.</hi> 4.34.) 'tis ſo acknowledged even by <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar. And at the end of the dayes I Nebuchad-nezzar lift up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine underſtanding returned unto mee, and I bleſſed the moſt high, and I praiſed and honoured him that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth for ever, whoſe dominion is an everlaſting dominion, and his Kingdome is from generation to generation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, His is an Effectuall Dominion. As he hath a right to doe what he will, ſo he hath ſtrength to effect what he willeth. Such is the dominion of God, and becauſe it is ſuch, even an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>rian, abſolute, everlaſting and effectuall Dominion. Therefore, let man remember his duty.</p>
                  <q>Dominion calleth for ſubjection.</q>
                  <p>That's the Apoſtles rule (<hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1.) <hi>Let every ſoule be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:153845:353"/> unto the higher powers:</hi> and if every ſoule ought to be ſubject unto the higher powers among men: then every ſoule ought to be ſubject, much more to the power of God, for his is the <hi>higheſt power.</hi> And thus we ought to ſubmit.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Unto his lawes; <hi>Legiſlative power is his,</hi> what God ſayth muſt be our rule. We may not diſpute, much leſſe quarrell at any of his commands, but obey them: naturally the heart of man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells againſt the law of God (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7.) <hi>The carnall minde is enmity againſt God: for it is not ſubject to the law of God, neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed can be;</hi> that is, it cannot be ſubject, while it remaineth carnal; onely a renewed or a ſpirituall minde ſubmits to a ſpirituall law.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Submit to his workes, to what he doth, as wel as to what he ſaith; and that, firſt, in the proviſion and allowances that he makes for you, that is a part of Gods dominion to cut out a portion for every man. Therefore in every eſtate be content; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, ſubmit to the works of God in his afflictions, and chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (1 <hi>Pe.</hi> 5.6.) <hi>Humble your ſelves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.</hi> When old <hi>Eli</hi> heard that terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meſſage concerning the deſtruction of his whole family (for <hi>Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him) hee ſayd it is the Lord: let him doe what ſeemeth him good</hi> (1 Sam. 3.18.) Thus the Church ſate downe in ſilence not ſpeaking a word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the act of God (<hi>Lam.</hi> 3.28.) Thirdly, ſubmit to God in the whole compaſſe of his government, in ordering the affayres of the whole world, when he breaks, and when he builds, when he ſets up, and when he pulls downe, when he makes peace, and when he makes warre, in all theſe acts of dominion ſubmit to God. When the Prophet calls us to behold what deſolations the Lord maketh in the earth, he adds this word as from the Lord, <hi>Be ſtill and know that I am God</hi> (Pſal. 46.10.) As if the Lord had ſayd, Let none queſtion mee for what I have done, <hi>I am God,</hi> and if ye know, indeed, <hi>that I am,</hi> ye will not have a word to ſay againſt <hi>what I doe.</hi> So (<hi>Zech:</hi> 2.13.) <hi>Be ſilent, O all fleſh, before the Lord: for he is raiſed up out of his holy habitation:</hi> He is riſen to make great changes, therefore be ſilent, ſubmit, let there be no murmuring at, no contending with his providences; <hi>for dominion and feare are with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some render this word <hi>feare,</hi> as an adjunct or Epithete of the
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:153845:354"/> former;<note place="margin">Dominatus &amp; quidem formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dabilis eſt penes illum. <hi>Jun:</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Dominion and that a terrible fearefull or formidable domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is with him,</hi> but rather diſtinctly as wee, <hi>Dominion and feare are with him.</hi> God hath no feare in him, nor upon him, for he is as infinitely above all feare, as he is above hope. But <hi>feare is with him,</hi> or, <hi>feare is his,</hi> becauſe he is ſo much to be feared. <hi>Feare is with God</hi> upon this threefold account.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe many at preſent doe feare the Lord: every God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man is a man fearing God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe every man ought to feare, dread, and ſtand in awe of God, even the Princes and powers and dominions of the earth, ought to feare the Lord. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11.) <hi>Be wiſe now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore O ye Kings; be inſtructed, O ye Judges of the earth, ſerve the Lord with feare, and rejoyce with trembling.</hi> Kings and Judges muſt ſerve and feare the Lord, or ſerve the Lord with feare. Who then muſt not?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Feare is with him;</hi> becauſe all ſhall feare and dread him at laſt, whether they will or no, they whoſe proud hearts ſtout it againſt God, they that goe on impudently in ſinne, feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of the Majeſty and wrath of God, yet a time will come when their ſtomacks ſhall be taken downe; a time will come when all the world ſhall tremble before the Lord. As now, many doe it, and as all ought to doe it, ſo all ſhall doe it. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.19.) <hi>They ſhall goe into the holes of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for feare of the Lord, and for the glory of his Majeſty; when hee ariſeth to ſhake terribly the earth.</hi> Such a day is comming upon the lofty ones, upon the Cedars and upon the Oakes, upon the feareleſſe, and they ſhall feare; and (which is the greateſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of feare) run into a hole for feare. It is prophecyed (<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi> 6.15.) That, <hi>the Kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chiefe Captaines, and the mighty men, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very bondman, and every free man ſhall hide themſelves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountaines, and ſay to the rocks and to the mountaines fall on us and hide us from the face of him that ſitteth on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lambe.</hi> They who having been threatned with the wrath of God, were no more afrayd then the rocks, ſhall, for feare, wooe the rocks to hide them from the wrath of God. Though <hi>Adam</hi> had not the feare of God to keepe him from ſinne, yet the feare of God fell upon him as ſoone as he
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:153845:354"/> had ſinned. (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.10.) <hi>I heard thy voice in the garden and I was affraid; becauſe I was naked and I hid my ſelfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>God is in himſelfe very dreadfull, hee is to be feared.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God is ſo much to be feared, that not onely <hi>feare is with him,</hi> but <hi>hee is feare.</hi> As becauſe God is ſo full of love, therefore the Scripture predicates love directly of God, <hi>God is love</hi> (1 Joh. 4.8.) ſo becauſe God is greatly to be feared, therefore he is called <hi>feare</hi> (Gen. 31.42.53.) <hi>Except the God of my father, the God of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and the feare of Iſaac</hi> (that is, the God whom my father <hi>Iſaac</hi> feared) <hi>had been with me, ſurely thou hadst ſent me away emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> ſayd <hi>Jacob</hi> in his conteſt with <hi>Laban.</hi> And at the 53<hi rend="sup">d</hi> verſe of the ſame Chapter he ſayth againe to <hi>Laban; the God of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

How much more then is the Lord to be feared, and how dreadfull is be to and among his ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e people, who know him ſavingly, who know him by Goſpel light. <hi>God is greatly to be feared in the aſſembly of the Saints: and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him</hi> (Pſal. 89.7.) Hee is terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly dreadfull amongſt the Heathen, hee is awfully or reverentially dreadfull among the Saints. <hi>Feare is with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, In reference to the greatneſſe of his power; conſider what God can doe, and that renders him dreadfull. Wee feare thoſe that can doe great things, thoſe eſpecially that can doe great things againſt us. For this reaſon Chriſt exhorts his Diſciples to feare God, when hee ſaw them in danger of a ſurpriſal by the feare of what men could doe againſt them (<hi>Luk.</hi> 12.4, 5.) <hi>I ſay unto you my friends be not afraid of them that kill the body, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that have no more that they can doe. But I will forewarne you
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:153845:355"/> whom yee ſhall feare: feare him which after hee hath killed, hath power to caſt into hell; yea, I ſay unto you, feare him.</hi> How is he to be feared, who at one ſtroake can peirce body and ſoule quite through, and throw both into hell? The Lord is to be feared upon the conſideration of the ordinary providentiall puttings forth of his power, how much more when he puts forth his power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily and Judicially? (<hi>Jer:</hi> 5.22.) <hi>Feare ye not me, ſayth the Lord? will yee not tremble at my preſence, which have placed the ſand for the bound of the Sea, by a perpetuall decree, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not paſſe it, and though the waves thereof toſſe themſelves, yet can they not prevaile, though they roare, yet can they not paſſe over it?</hi> I have done this thing, put a ſtop to the Sea, I have put a bridle into the mouth of the Sea, I can check the waves when they roare and toſſe, and will ye not feare me?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God is to be feared for his goodneſſe, as we read at the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of the ſame Chapter, where the Lord upbraides their want of feare, while they remembred his moſt ordinary good providences at land; <hi>Neither ſay they in their heart, let us now feare the Lord our God, that giveth raine, both the former and the latter in his ſeaſon: hee reſerveth unto us the appointed weekes of the harveſt.</hi> If God be to be feared for that witnes of his goodneſſe which is held out by raine and fruitfull ſeaſons, or by filling the hearts of men in common with food and gladnes, then how much more is God to be feared for the diſtinguiſhing acts of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and mercy, the pardon of ſin, and the giving out of his Spirit. <hi>There is forgivenes with thee, that thou mayeſt be feared,</hi> ſayd the Pſalmiſt (130.4.) and (<hi>Hoſ:</hi> 3.5.) <hi>They ſhall feare the Lord and his goodneſſe in the latter dayes;</hi> that is, they ſhall feare the Lord becauſe of his goodnes, his ſpeciall goodnes to his Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in advancing them to all their ſpirituall liberties &amp; priviledges in the latter dayes. And thus the Lord is ſayd to be not onely <hi>glorious in holineſſe,</hi> but <hi>fearefull in praiſes;</hi> becauſe we ſhould feare him when wee are praiſing him, both becauſe hee hath wrought ſo much goodnes and mercy for thoſe who are unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, as alſo leſt while we receave ſo much from the hand of his goodnes and mercy, we ſhould walke unworthyly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When the text ſayth, <hi>Feare is with him,</hi> wee learne, That
<q>God can ſtrike man with feare when he pleaſeth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="683" facs="tcp:153845:355"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Power is with him,</hi> and he can put forth his power: if God ſend out his power, it goeth and prevaileth. So <hi>feare is with him,</hi> and hee can ſend out his feare to ſtrike whom he will with feare, when and as oft as hee will. The Scriprure ſheweth the Lord ſending forth his feare at pleaſure, and attaching the ſtrongeſt and hardy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the children of men. It is ſayd (<hi>Gen.</hi> 35.5.) <hi>And they jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyed</hi> (that is, <hi>Jacob</hi> and his ſmall company) <hi>and the terrour of God was upon the Cities that were round about them, and they did not purſue after the ſons of Jacob.</hi> The terrour of God was ſent out to keepe them in, ſo that none of them ſtirred. Elſe no doubt but all the Cities would have purſued them becauſe of that high provocation which the ſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> had given them by the late ſlaughter of the <hi>Sichemites.</hi> When God promiſed to ſend Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets before the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to drive out the uncircumciſed Nations, this feare was the Hornet (<hi>Exod.</hi> 23.28.) God ſtung their hearts with feare, or (as it were by Hornets) buzz'd a feare into their eares; as he did into the eares of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped before <hi>Samaria</hi> (2 Kings 7.6, 7.) <hi>The Lord made the hoſt of the Syrians to heare a noiſe of Charets, and a noiſe of Horſes, even the noiſe of a great hoſt: and they ſayd one to another, loe the King of Iſrael hath hired againſt us the Kings of the Hittites, and the Kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us. Wherefore they aroſe, and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horſes, and their aſſes, even the campe as it was, and fled for their life.</hi> As a word from God makes the heart confident and bold in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt danger, ſo a word from God makes the heart fearefull and cowardly, where there is no danger at all. This is the glory of God, that he can command our paſſions. <hi>That by a word he can make them feare, who doe not at all feare his word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many men have feare belonging to them, yet they cannot ſend out their feare, they are in great place, and ſo both dominion over men, and feare are with them (for unto whomſoever dominion belongs, feare doth belong (<hi>Rom.</hi> 13.7.) <hi>Render to every man his due, tribute to whom tribute is due, cuſtome to whom cuſtome, feare to whom feare, honour to whom honour</hi> Yet (I ſay) many have dominion and feare belonging unto them, who cannot ſend out their feare. Their power is deſpiſed, and none regards them; they command, and are not obeyed, they promiſe and are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, they threaten, and are not feared. Onely God can ſend
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:153845:356"/> out his feare, and make every man fall and tremble before him When many armed men came to take Chriſt, Chriſt ſent out a feare upon them, ſo that <hi>they went backward and fell to the ground (Joh.</hi> 18.6.) Chriſt gave them never an angry word, he onely confeſſed himſelfe to be the man they ſought for, <hi>I am he;</hi> and they were as men aſtoniſhed with feare; Chriſt in ſpeaking thoſe words did onely let out a little ray or beame of his Deity, and this ſtruck them downe. O what feare will Chriſt ſend out when he commeth to judge the world, who could ſend forth ſuch a feare, while he yeelded himſelfe up to be judged and condemned by the world. <hi>Dominion and feare are with him.</hi> He can make all afrayd, and yet, as it followeth;
<q>Hee maketh peace in his high places.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This latter part of the verſe, is a continued deſcription of the irreſiſtible power of God (as all agree) in making peace, yet there is ſome difference what ſhould be meant <hi>by the high places,</hi> where <hi>God maketh peace; Hee maketh peace in his high places.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Many underſtand theſe <hi>high places,</hi> to be <hi>the Heavens,</hi> or (as the Scripture ſpeaketh) <hi>the Hoſt of Heaven,</hi> Sunne, Moone, and Starres; There or among them peace is made through the power of God, keeping them in or to order, that is, in their dueſt motions. The heavenly bodies are in continuall ſtrong motion, and they are kept in their motion by the power of God. The Sunne, Moone, and Starres, are mighty bodies, and they are in a perpetuall <hi>career,</hi> yet they juſtle not one againſt another, nor doe they fall fowle upon one another. In this ſence it may be ſayd, that God maketh peace among them; They all according to his appoyntment keepe their places, and ſtirre not out of their owne ſpheares No man could ever keepe his Watch or Clock in ſuch order as God keepes the Sunne.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By theſe <hi>high places,</hi> others underſtand that which is ſomewhat lower; not Sunne, Moone, and Starres, but the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall regions of the ayre; God makes peace in thoſe high places, where ſtormes and tempeſts and all manner of fiery impreſſions are bred and wrought. Naturaliſts ſay, that the ſecond region of the ayre is both the ſhop where thoſe dreadfull inſtruments of warre, Thunder, lightning, hayle, ſnow, are formed, as alſo the ſtore-houſe where they are layd up; yet even in thoſe high places,
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:153845:356"/> God maketh peace. If hee ſpeake to the thunder,<note place="margin">Deus vel ſolo nutu tranquillat elementorum diſſidia tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtateſ<expan>

And they fullfill it whether in going or in ſtaying. Thus God maketh peace in the high places of the ayre, and upon the high waves of the Sea. Chriſt did but rebuke the Sea, and ſay to it (when it was in its feirceſt rage) <hi>peace, be ſtill, and there was a great calme</hi> (Mark. 4.39.) The ayre is under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of God as much as Sea or Land; And he <hi>maketh peace in thoſe high places.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The words are expounded of thoſe high places which are the more proper ſeate of Angels. And ſo God may be ſayd to make peace in his places, becauſe hee maketh peace among the Angels, that is, he keepeth the Angels in peace; The Angells doe not contend one with another, and none of them dares contend with God. Some urge this expoſition as moſt pertinent to <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dads</hi> purpoſe for the conviction of <hi>Job;</hi> As if he had ſayd,<note place="margin">His verbis vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licatur Job qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi inſolens ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels dare not contend with God, And doeſt thou (O <hi>Job</hi>) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with God? The Angels utter not a word againſt God, and dareſt thou undertake to plead with him, and engage him in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie?</p>
                  <p>A fourth ſort, by Gods <hi>making peace in his high places,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand onely thus much, That all is quiet in heaven, or that God hath a moſt peaceable and quiet fruition, and enjoyment of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; Hee hath had it from eternity, and will have it unto eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, this is the bleſſedneſſe of God, hee is above all trouble and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbment. And thus alſo <hi>Bildad</hi> ſeemes to reprove <hi>Job; Wilt thou begin a conteſt with God, wilt thou trouble God himſelfe, who maketh peace in his high places, who lives in everlaſting reſt and quiet. God doth not uſe to be ſued and pleaded with as thou ſeemeſt over-boldly to deſire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Theſe <hi>high places</hi> are expounded for the high places of the earth; As if he had ſayd, God makes peace amongſt the States, Princes, and powers of the world, who are in high places, and in Gods high places. For every throne is Gods, and thrones are high places. As the heavens are high places in compariſon of the whole earth, ſo ſome places of the earth (in a civil capacity as wel as in a natural) are higher then the reſt. Now among thoſe that
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:153845:357"/> are in his high places of power and authority, the Lord maketh peace, and this is a very glorious worke of God. Thus wee ſee there are many high places, and they are all the high places of God; yet I conceave that <hi>Bilded</hi> cheifely if not onely aymes at Heaven, which is more peculiarly the high place of God; as being that to which (though many lay claime to the high places of the earth) none beſides God ever did make claime or lay title.</p>
                  <p>Further, Beſides theſe different apprehenſions about <hi>the high places,</hi> there is a difference in the reading of the words together; ſome thus; <hi>Hee worketh in peace in his high places;</hi> That is, what troubles ſoever are here on earth, there is peace and quietneſſe in heaven, or there God worketh in peace and quietneſſe. Others, thus; <hi>The Dominion and feare which are with him make peace in his high places;</hi> As if the dominion and power of God were that to which peace-making is aſcribed as an effect. Or as if he had ſayd, <hi>God hath authority enough to compoſe all differences, yea he ſo orders things in heaven that there ariſeth no difference in thoſe high places, his dominion and feare keepe all in peace.</hi> There are no murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings nor diſcontents, much leſſe any rebellions or open warres in heaven.</p>
                  <p>M. <hi>Broughton</hi> reports the Chaldee tranſlation in a phraſe very uncouth in our language; <hi>Sultanſhip and feare be with him:</hi> (ſome Eaſterne Princes are called <hi>Sultans) He maketh peace in his high heavens.</hi> To which he adds the expoſition or gloſſe of the Chaldee Paraphraſe; <hi>Michael is on his right hand; and hee is of fire; Gabriel is on his left hand; and he is of water; and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly creatures be part of fire and part of water.</hi> But M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Broughton</hi> gives a good corrective, <hi>ſuch Fables S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul forbiddeth.</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, though it be difficult which of the high places before-named are here meant, yet it is a truth that all high places are his high places, and that in what high place ſoever peace is made, God maketh it. <hi>He maketh peace in his high places.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>Peace-making is the worke of God.</q>
                  <p>And as God makes peace every where, ſo he makes every kinde of peace. Wee finde peace ſpoken of in Scripture in a five-fold oppoſition; and God the maker of that five-fold peace.</p>
                  <pb n="687" facs="tcp:153845:357"/>
                  <p>Firſt, Hee maketh peace in the high places of the world, <hi>as peace is oppoſed to any kinde of trouble, or affliction.</hi> Peace is uſually accompanyed with proſperity, and peace ſignifies any kinde of proſperity. Peace in this extent is aſſumed by God himſelfe as his proper worke (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.7.) <hi>I forme the light, and create darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, I make peace and create evill, I the Lord doe all theſe things;</hi> that is, I doe them and none can doe them without me, or but by mee.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God maketh peace as peace is (more ſtrictly) ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in oppoſition to warre and tumults; <hi>He cauſeth warre to ceaſe in all the world,</hi> (Pſal. 46.9.) <hi>Hee maketh warre to ceaſe unto the end of the earth; Hee breaketh the bow, and cutteth the ſpeare in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, hee burneth the Chariots in the fire.</hi> He that deſtroyeth all the Inſtruments of warre, doth ſurely make peace; and he that maketh warre to ceaſe, doth certainly make peace begin. Peace is made two wayes; firſt, by taking up the differences and reconciling the Spirits of men; ſecondly, by breaking the power and taking away all proviſions of warre from men. The Lord maketh peace by both theſe wayes, or by eyther of them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God maketh peace as peace is oppoſed to perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; There may be no warre in a Nation, and yet no peace to the people of God, by reaſon of ſore and fiery perſecution; yea a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral peace is the very opportunity which perſecuters looke for, to breake the peace of particular men. The moſt bloody times that the Church ever had, have been the moſt peaceable times of Nations. And when nations are moſt troubled, then Churches uſually get their libertyes, and are moſt quiet. Such a peace as this the Churches had, though I cannot ſay they had it upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. (<hi>Acts</hi> 9.31.) <hi>Then had the Churches reſt</hi> (or peace, that is, they were quiet from their cruel perſecutours) <hi>throughout all Judea, and Galile, and Samaria, and were edified, and walking in the feare of the Lord, and in the comfort of the holy Ghoſt, were mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed.</hi> This peace doth God make for his Saints, his little flocke, that they may ſometimes lye downe in Greene paſtures, and beſide the <hi>ſtill waters,</hi> without feare of the Wolves and Lyons, who would alwayes teare and worry them. Thus the Lord promiſeth (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.17, 18.). <hi>I will make thy officers peace, and thine exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours righteouſneſſe, violence ſhall no more be heard in thy land, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting nor deſtruction within thy borders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="688" facs="tcp:153845:358"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, God maketh peace, as peace is oppoſed to <hi>diſſention</hi> among brethren. It is poſſible there may be no warre in a place, yea no perſecution, none to vex the people of God, and yet they may have great diſſentions, vexations, and diviſions among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. This peace the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> wanted, when none from without troubled the Church. Hence that rebuke which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle gives them (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3.) <hi>Whereas there is among you envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtrife and diviſions, are ye not carnal and walke as men?</hi> Thus Saints and Churches warre one with and trouble another, when the world gives them no trouble at all. To the keeping of this peace Chriſt admoniſheth his Diſciples (<hi>Mark.</hi> 9.50.) <hi>Have ſalt in your ſelves, and have peace one with another.</hi> But why did Chriſt ſpeake thus to his owne Diſciples; <hi>have peace one with another?</hi> Were they ready to make warre one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? had they any Armyes to engage and lead out into the feild againſt one another? ſurely none. Therefore when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>have peace one with another,</hi> his meaning was onely this, wrangle not with one another, fall not out one with one another. The Diſciples were not like to run into any other warre but that of diſſention amongſt themſelves. And this warre may be in thoſe Churches that live in the moſt peaceable condition. And 'tis God onely who makes peace as in his high places both of heaven and earth, ſo in his holy places.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, God makes peace as peace is oppoſed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, for there may be conſent amongſt men, and yet much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order among men, yea they may (poſſibly) agree, conſent and center together in that which is moſt diſorderly. Of this peace the Apoſtle ſpeakes (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.33.) <hi>God is not the author of confuſion but of peace, as in all Churches of the Saints,</hi> that is, God would have every one keepe his order and his place; He would not have the Prophets ſpeak all together in the Church, for that is diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; nor would he have women ſpeake at all in the Church, for that alſo is diſorderly. That which breakes order breakes peace, for there can be no true peace without order, and God is not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of diſorder or confuſion in Churches but of peace.</p>
                  <p>Thus peace-making is the worke of God in this five-fold oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as peace is oppoſed to trouble, as peace is oppoſed to warre, as peace is oppoſed to perſecution, as peace is oppoſed to diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and laſtly, as peace is oppoſed to diſorder. To make peace in
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:153845:358"/> all theſe kindes, is as much the honour as it is onely in the power of God. <hi>He maketh peace in his high places.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>Where God is moſt eminently, there is moſt peace.</q>
                  <p>Hee makes peace on the earth, but in his high places where his moſt glorious appearance is, there is nothing but peace. And as There is nothing but peace in heaven, where God declares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe moſt clearely, ſo they to whom God declares himſelfe moſt clearely on earth are moſt for peace: the neerer and the liker wee are unto God, the neerer wee are unto peace, and the more wee like it. All true peace floweth out from God, and the more of a healing and peace-making ſpirit appeares in any man, the more of God appeares in him.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, By way of inference; Take this, Firſt,</p>
                  <p>Seeing God makes peace in his high places, or in heaven above, how eaſily can hee (when our breaches are wideſt) make peace in theſe low places of the earth. And becauſe, as it is his property, ſo his promiſe to doe it, wee ſhould waite upon him for and urge him with the fullfilling of this promiſe, that he who makes peace alwayes in the high places of heaven, would make that five-fold peace in the low places of the earth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Seeing God is able to make peace in all places, hee can alſo make warre in all places. The ſame power doth both, and <hi>Bildad</hi> ſhewes the preparations of God for warre as wel as his ſanctions of peace. For he hath innumerable Armyes under his command, as it follows in the next verſe.</p>

                  <p>There ſeemes to be ſomewhat a ſtrange conjunction between theſe two verſes, <hi>hee maketh peace,</hi> and, <hi>Is there any number of his Armies?</hi> One would thinke wee ſhould heare of nothing but warre, when we heare of ſuch numberleſſe armies. God hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable invincible armies, alwayes ready for warre, yet hee is moſt ready to make peace; yea he who is <hi>The Lord of Hoſts,</hi> is alſo ſtiled, <hi>The Lord of peace</hi> (2 Theſ. 3.16.) This likewiſe ſpeakes the dominion, power, and Majeſty of God in that he maketh peace,
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:153845:359"/> and can make warre. <hi>His armyes are at hand,</hi> and thoſe no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible ones. As if <hi>Bildad</hi> had thus beſpoken <hi>Job; It is in vaine for thee who art a weake man, to thinke of contending with God, who hath numberleſſe armyes to take his part againſt all oppoſers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word which wee tranſlate <hi>Armyes,</hi> properly ſignifies <hi>Troopes. Is there any number of his troopes?</hi> And this is given in name to one of the Patriarchs (<hi>Gen.</hi> 30.11.) <hi>And Leah ſayd, a Troop cometh; And ſhee called his name Gad.</hi> A troop is a little Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and a great Army conſiſts of many troopes. Wee ſay, <hi>Is there any number of his Armies?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Scripture ſayth, that God hath armies, it is not to be underſtood as if God needed them, eyther to protect himſelfe, or to ſuppreſſe his enemies; <hi>The Lord of hoſts</hi> himſelfe is infinitely ſtronger then all the Armyes and hoſts of which he is Lord. Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Princes have their Armyes, and guards, to protect their perſons and dominions from danger and invaſion. They want armyes to helpe their friends abroad, and to defend their Subjects at home. Woldly Princes borrow power from others to protect themſelves, while they undertake to protect others. But God is the guard of his guards, and the ſtrength of his owne armyes. Princes are ſaved by their Armyes, but God is the ſafety of his armyes. The Gods of the earth are afrayd of what man may doe unto them, but the God of heaven is not onely above thoſe feares, but alſo above all want of mans doing any thing for him. So that, <hi>as God is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped with mans hands</hi> (as the Apoſtle tells The <hi>Athenians, Act.</hi> 17.25.) <hi>as though he needed any thing,</hi> ſo neyther is he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by mens hands or by any hand, as if he needed any thing, <hi>ſeeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore when the Lord is ſayd to have Armyes, it is ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſignifie, firſt, that he hath all things at his command, and is full of power, or ſecondly, that although he can doe all things by himſelfe, yet he will uſe the agency of the creature to effect his purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>This queſtion, <hi>Is there any number of his armyes?</hi> reſolves it ſelfe into this negative, There is no number of his armyes, or there is no numbring of them. But what are theſe armyes of God?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Angells are his armyes: we reade of one Angel that deſtroyed a whole army, (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.35.) <hi>And it came to paſſe that night, that the Angel of the Lord went out, and ſmote in the
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:153845:359"/> campe of the Aſſyrians, an hundred fourſcore and five thouſand; and when they aroſe early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpſes.</hi> If one Angel deſtroyed an army, what cannot an army of Angels doe? The Angels of God are armyes without number. We read them expreſſed by ſuch great numbers, as render their numbers inexpreſſible. So in <hi>Daniels</hi> viſion of the Glory of God (<hi>Chap.</hi> 7.10.) <hi>A fiery ſtreame iſſued, and came forth from before him: thouſand thouſands miniſtred unto him, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand ſtood before him;</hi> that is, an innumerable company ſtood before him. Chriſt ſayd to <hi>Peter</hi> when he drew his ſword and ſought to reſcue him from the Officers of the High-Prieſt that came to arreſt and bring him to Judgement, <hi>Put up thy ſword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into his place, for all they that take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword. Thinkeſt thou that I cannot now pray to my father, and he ſhall preſently give mee more then twelve legions of Angels</hi> (Math. 26.53.) Here is an army of Angels. Chriſt ſpeaketh in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man phraſe, who reckoned their armyes by legions, as we doe by regiments, <hi>Six thouſand ſix hundred ſixty ſix</hi> was the number of a legion as ſome affirme, and if ſo, Then twelve legions make <hi>Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nine thouſand nine hundred ninety two;</hi> a great Army; but (ſaith Chriſt) my father can ſend <hi>more then twelve legions.</hi> But how many more, no man can ſay. Chriſt pitcheth upon a great certaine number, to ſhew that hee might have what number hee would, if hee did but call for them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Sunne, Moone, &amp; Starres, are the Armyes of God. (<hi>Judges</hi> 5.20.) <hi>They fought from heaven,</hi> That is, the heavenly or aeriall meteors, wind, thunder, hayle, did as it were joyne their confederate forces for the deſtruction of <hi>Iſraels</hi> enemies (as they had done before, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10.11. and as they did afterward, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.10.) yea as it followeth in the ſame place, <hi>the Starres in their courſes fought againſt Siſera.</hi> The Starres charged like an Army in battel array, rayſing ſtormes and dreadfull tempeſts by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, and ſo might be ſayd to fight againſt and ruine the whole army of <hi>Sicera.</hi> By all which Rhetoricall expreſſions the Spirit would lead us to underſtand, that the Lord himſelfe by inviſible powers did fight againſt <hi>Siſera,</hi> while <hi>Iſrael</hi> fought him with a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible power. Surely if the Starres be the Lords armyes, wee may well ſay, <hi>is there any number of his armyes?</hi> When the Lord would ſhew <hi>Abraham</hi> that his ſeed ſhould be an innumerable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:153845:360"/> 
                     <hi>hee brought him forth and ſayd, looke now towards heaven, and tell the Starres, if thou be able to number them. And hee ſayd unto him, ſo ſhall thy ſeed bee</hi> (Gen. 15.5.) that is, thy ſeed ſhall be numberleſſe, as the Starres are numberleſſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, By theſe Armyes wee may underſtand, not onely the Angells, and the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, that heavenly hoſt, but any creature, yea all the creatures, from the Elephant even to the worme that creepeth upon the ground, or to the fly that buzzeth in the ayre, or to the lice that breede out of corruption. All theſe are the Armyes of God; and by theſe he can doe his worke as well as by the Angells in heaven. What were the armyes of God, with which he made warre upon <hi>Pharaoh?</hi> were they not flyes and lice and ſuch like contemptible creatures, muſtred together at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? therefore the Text may well ſay, <hi>Is there any number of his armies?</hi> God can leavy an army upon the earth, not onely of men, but of beaſts, and not onely of Lyons and Elephants, the ſtouteſt and greateſt beaſts, but of the weakeſt and meaneſt, and not onely of the weakeſt and meaneſt among living creatures, but of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Inanimate creatures, the ſtones in the feilds, the winds in the ayre, the waters of the Sea, yea the ſand of the Sea, and the very duſt of the earth are the armyes of God, if hee give them commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ſend them forth. God and the weakeſt creature are an overmatch for the ſtrongeſt creatures; 'Tis no matter how meane the meanes is, or how inconſiderable the inſtrument, ſo it be in the hand of God, ſo it be of Gods providing, and goe forth at his bidding. God can leavy an army where he will, and out of what he will, and it ſhall doe the deed. Now if all things or any thing may be his army, no marvayle if it be ſayd, <hi>Is there any number of his Armyes?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>All creatures are the host the Armyes of God.</q>
                  <p>They may be called his Armyes in a threefold conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe of their multitude, a few cannot make an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. There are many creatures of every kinde, how many then are all of every kinde put together?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They are his Armyes, becauſe of their order; The greateſt <hi>many</hi> out of order doe not make an Army, but a throng or heape. Armyes are martiall'd and diſciplin'd, trayned and
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:153845:360"/> taught. An Army is an ordered company; all the creatures are in order by nature, and when God calls they are in order as it were by Art.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They are his Armyes, becauſe as God hath a power to command them, ſo they are ready to obey him; They (as the Centurion in the Goſpel ſayd of his Souldiers) goe when God ſayth goe, they come, when he ſayth come, and if he bid them doe this or that they doe it. Souldiers muſt neyther refuſe nor diſpute the commands of their General. The moſt violent and boyſterous creatures, are obedient to the call of God; <hi>ſtormy winds and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts fullfill his word</hi> (Pſal. 148.8.) Hee ſpeakes to the <hi>lightnings;</hi> and they ſay, <hi>heere are wee</hi> (Job 38.35.) The very thunder which ſeemes to be all voyce, is all eare at the voyce of God. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are ſo ready to goe, that they are ſayd to fly, and their readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to doe the will of God in heaven, is made the patterne of our doing it here on earth. The Scripture ſpeakes often of them as of an army employed in warres, eyther to deſtroy the wicked, or to be a guard to the people of God. We have an illuſtrious example of the latter in <hi>Jacobs</hi> caſe (<hi>Gen.</hi> 32.2.) <hi>And when Jacob ſaw them, hee ſayd, this is Gods hoſt: and hee called the name of that place Mahanaim, that is, two hoſts or companies.</hi> And it might be ſo called, becauſe <hi>Jacobs</hi> company or little hoſt, and that company of Angels who were Gods hoſt ſent out to convoy him in ſafety, did both encampe upon the ſame ground; or rather becauſe the Angels divided themſelves into two companyes, The one encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and marching before him as his Vantguard, the other behind him or in his Reere; That ſo he might ſee himſelfe every way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, and might be filled with a full aſſurance of ſafety. That God hath ſuch numerous Armyes alwayes at hand and under command, is</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A very comfortable hearing to all that love and feare God. The Apoſtle ſayth (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.31.) <hi>If God be for us, who can be againſt us?</hi> that is, none can. Though many be againſt us op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſingly yet none can be againſt us prevaylingly. We may ſay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo if the Lord be for us, who will not be for us? If God be our helper, we cannot want helpers, not onely becauſe the helpe of God is enough without any more, but becauſe, if he be our helper we ſhall have many more. When we ſee our ſelves utterly deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all helpes and helpers, yet God hath an army of helpers,
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:153845:361"/> he hath auxiliary forces ready for us. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.7.) <hi>The Angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that feare him, and delivereth them. David</hi> ſpeaketh as if one ſingle Angel were a whole Army; <hi>The Angel of the Lord</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>encampeth,</hi> he doth not ſay the Angels of the Lord encampe about them that feare him; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed every Angel of the Lord is more in power, then a whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of men; yet here, poſſibly, is meant that Angel who is the Lord, The Angel of the Covenant, who as Captaine General with his Army of created Angels encampeth about them that feare God. And if ſo, then they need not be afrayd. (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.16, 17.) When the ſervant of <hi>Eliſha</hi> cryed out for feare, <hi>Eliſha an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, feare not: they that be with us are more then they that bee with them. And Eliſha prayed, And ſayd, Lord, I pray thee open his eyes that hee may ſee, and the Lord opened the eyes of the young man, and hee ſaw: and behold, the mountaine was full of horſes; and Charrets of fire round about Eliſha.</hi> And thus it is often with us though wee diſcerne it not. Wee have many inviſible ſuccours, in our viſible dangers. And as, that the Angels are our helpers in eminent and extraordinary dangers is very comfortable, ſo alſo, that they are ſo againſt ordinary, common or every-day-dangers. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.11, 12.) <hi>Hee ſhall give his Angells charge over thee; to keepe thee in all thy wayes. They ſhall beare thee up in their hands; leſt thou daſh thy foote againſt a ſtone,</hi> that is, leſt thou take hurt in thy dayly workes and travels.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Theſe Armyes are a terrour to all thoſe who rebell and riſe up againſt God, or are enemies to his people. Hee that reſiſts God hath as many enemyes as there are Angells in heaven, or ſtarres in the firmament, or ſtones in the earth, or beaſts in the feild; ſo many enemies hath he, and if God appeare as Captaine generall, none ſhall be able to ſtand before his armyes, though he levy them of Graſſe-hoppers, or flyes, or wormes, or lice. How ſhould the greateſt feare to provoke God, who can make them fall by that which is leaſt? For as <hi>David</hi> acknowledged (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.16, 17.) <hi>There is no King ſaved by the multitude of an hoſt: a mighty man is not delivered by much ſtrength: a horſe is a vaine thing for ſafety: neither ſhall he deliver any by his great ſtrength.</hi> So we muſt acknowledge, That if God will, any King may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the ſmalleſt hoſt, that a mighty man may be overcome by that which hath no ſtrength, that a fly is a ſufficient thing for
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:153845:361"/> ruine, and that, if God ſay the word, even that ſhall not onely trouble but ſubdue any man with its little or no ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note.</p>
                  <q>The power which God can draw forth is a limitleſſe power. His Armyes are without number.</q>
                  <p>When Princes have greateſt Armyes they may number them, and tell you how many hundreds and how many thouſands and how many hundred thouſands they have. We have read of many very numerous Armyes, but wee never yet read of an innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble army, onely Gods army is without number, and therefore onely his knowes no bounds. <hi>Is there any number of his Armyes?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>And upon whom doth not his light ariſe?</q>
                  <p>Here <hi>Bildad</hi> ſets forth the glory of the goodnes,<note place="margin">De homine propriè dicit <gap reason="foreign">

                  <q>

                  <p>The text may be read thus; <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon whom doth not his light ſtand?</hi> or, <hi>upon whom ſhall not his light ſtand?</hi> Wee ſay, <hi>upon whom doth not his light ariſe?</hi> Both tranſlations are good. But what is this light of God?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Wee may underſtand it of that common light, the light of the Sunne, for that is Gods light, and the univerſall ariſing of it upon the world is a wonderfull worke of God. For as God made the light, and gathered it into that great veſſel the Sunne, ſo hee carrieth it about the world every day. The light of the Sunne is the meſſenger of Gods care and love to man every morning. (<hi>Math.</hi> 5.45.) <hi>Hee maketh his Sunne to riſe on the Evill and on the Good;</hi> that is, upon all, Good and Evill, divide the whole world between them: and while the text in <hi>Mathew</hi> ſaith, that <hi>God maketh his Sunne to riſe,</hi> &amp;c. it intimates that the Sunne ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth dayly by ſpeciall direction from God; The Sunne is his, and the light is his; There is no creature that enjoyes the light of the Sunne, but is beholding to God for it. Hee that made the Sunne, maketh the Sunne to riſe; as if the Sunne like a weary or tired
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:153845:362"/> traveller were unwilling to riſe in a morning and renew his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or long ſtage about the world, till called up by God, and commanded out for the ſervice of mankinde; of Sun-light we may ſay, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon whom doth not his light ariſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, This light may be taken more ſtrictly for the light of divine goodneſſe. All the good, the peace, the comfort, which wee injoy in the world, is comprehended under the name of light. When the Pſalmiſt ſayth, <hi>Light is ſowen for the righteous,</hi> his meaning is, <hi>good or comfort is ſowen for the righteous,</hi> (Pſal. 97.11.) and, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon whom doth not this light ariſe?</hi> The goodneſſe of God extends it ſelfe over all. God doth good to all, though he doth more good for ſome; for as God would have us to doe good to all, but ſpecially to the houſhold of faith, ſo doth hee. Hee ſends forth ſo much light of goodneſſe as will make all men eternally inexcuſable who abuſe it, but he ſends forth ſo much light of his goodnes to ſome as will make them eternally happy. The light of his gooddeſſe riſeth upon good men to cauſe them to rejoyce and live comfortably; And unleſſe ſome light of his goodnes did ariſe upon evill men, even upon the worſt of men, they could not ſubſiſt, nor live at all. His light is the life of man, <hi>and upon whom doth not this light of divine goodneſſe ariſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Wee may expound this light of the light of divine wiſdome, which diſpoſeth and ordereth all things; And doth not this light ariſe upon the whole creation? doth not this light ſhine upon every creature? doth not this light direct the wayes of man on earth? yea doth not this light ariſe upon the Angels in heaven, to direct them in all their wayes?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Wee may underſtand this light of the light of that knowledge by which God himſelfe knoweth all things. As God is light eſſentially, or as all that he is, is light, ſo we may ſay more eſpecially of his knowledge, it is light. Knowledge is the light of man, and therefore we ſay of an ignorant or unknowing man that he is in darkenes; and thus alſo knowledge is the light of God; and when the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith (1 <hi>Epiſt:</hi> 1.) <hi>That in him is no darkenes at all,</hi> his meaning is in him is no ignorance at all. God ſends forth this light of his knowledge all the world over, he takes notice of all; As nothing is hid (in a common ſence) from the heate or light of the Sunne in its walke about the world, ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is hid in, any, the ſtricteſt ſence from the knowledge of God.
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:153845:362"/> 
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon whom doth not this light ariſe?</hi> wee are alwayes in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, his eye is upon us and ſees us, hee ſees where we are, and what wee doe; and as this light of his ſhines upon all things, ſo it will, at laſt, bring all things to light.</p>
                  <p>Now, among theſe foure interpretations given, I conceive that the word <hi>light</hi> is to be taken here in the ſecond ſence, <hi>upon whom doth not his light ariſe?</hi> That is, the light of the goodnes of God:<note place="margin">V detur potius lacis, nomen ad v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> which goodneſſe is the infinite freenes and readines of his nature to doe good. And this light of his goodnes ariſing upon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is five-fold.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There is an upholding or preſerving Goodnes, by which all things are maintained in their ſtate and being.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a quickning and refreſhing goodnes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all things (men, and among them godly men eſpecially) are renewed and revived in their wel-being.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is a protecting goodnes of God, whereby his are kept while they are in dangers.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, There is a delivering goodneſs, whereby his are brought out of and ſet free from danger.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, There is a ſtrengthning and ſupporting goodneſs, whereby his are enabled to beare all the evills with which they are exerciſed in this world. And upon whom (yea upon what) doth not the light of the goodnes of God ariſe every day in ſome one or more of theſe particulars?</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>All the light of man or the light of all men is from God.</q>
                  <p>If any light ariſe upon man it is of God, and upon what man ſoever light ariſeth it is of God. As the light of the ayre is his, ſo alſo is the light of our hearts. The light of life is his, and ſo is all that light of comfort which ſhines upon us while we live. <hi>God is the father of lights, from whom every good gift and every perfect gift commeth</hi> (Jam: 1.17.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>God is very communicative of his goodneſſe; upon whom doth not his light ariſe?</q>
                  <p>God doth not keep his light to himſelfe; <hi>he is good, and doth good;</hi> hee hath good, and doth good, he diſtributes it; God would not
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:153845:363"/> have us, much leſſe doth he himſelfe <hi>put his candle or light under a buſhell, but hee ſets it upon a candleſticke,</hi> and it giveth light to all the world, it refreſheth and warmeth all the world. As the light of the ſpeciall goodnes of God in Chriſt ariſeth upon all ſorts and conditions of men in the world, ſo there is a light of his common providentiall goodnes which ariſeth upon each man of every ſort and condition in the world.</p>

The naturall Sunne ariſeth every day upon us, but it doth not dwell with us, but is going from us as ſoone as it appeares unto us; and therefore it was miraculous when the Sunne ſtood ſtill, or haſted not to goe downe about a whole day (<hi>Joſh.</hi> 10.13.) But the myſticall light of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God is a light that dwelleth alwayes over our heads, and haſteth not to goe downe. And indeed if God ſhould withdraw this light, or let it goe downe, if he ſhould ſtop the influences of his kindnes from us, and ceaſe to doe us good, wee were ruin'd and undone; <hi>for in him all things ſubſiſt, and are upheld by the word of his power;</hi> if his light did not ariſe upon the creature, the creature would ſinke into darkneſſe.

My foot hath followed his ſteps, his way have I kept and haue not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, neither have I gone back from the Commandements of his lips: I have eſteemed the words of his mouth more then my neceſſary food.</hi> While <hi>Job</hi> thus aſſerted his owne Innocency and Integrity, <hi>Bildad</hi> might poſſibly ſuppoſe that hee was aſſerting his owne righteouſneſſe; and therefore not without ſome indignation hee expoſtulates the matter with him, <hi>How can man be Juſtified?</hi> that is, pronounced cleane and quit at the Throne of God. <hi>Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (Conſidered in the Goſpel notion) <hi>is that gracious ſentence of God, wherein with reſpect to Chriſt apprehended by faith, hee abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the beleever from ſin and death, and doth repute him juſt and righteous unto eternal life.</hi> Of this the Apoſtle treates at large in the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">••</hi> and 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapters of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and in that to the <hi>Galatians.</hi> This doctrine of free juſtification is the
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:153845:364"/> foundation and corner ſtone of all our comfort. For whereas there is a double change in the ſtate of a ſinner; firſt, a relative change; ſecondly, an abſolute and reall change. The one is made in ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, the other in Juſtification; Sanctification is a reall change, ſubduing corruption, deſtroying the power of ſin in us; but Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is not a Phyſicall or real change in the perſon, it doth not make him that is unrighteous righteous in himſelfe, nor is man at all Juſtified (in this ſence) by any ſelfe-righteouſnes, but it is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a relative change as to his ſtate. To Juſtifie is a Law-terme, ſignifying, the pronouncing or declaring of a man righteous: So that Juſtification is an act of God upon us, or towards us: Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is an act of God in us. This bleſſed Grace of Sanctification alwayes followeth the grace of Juſtification, as an effect or fruit of it; and though it may eaſily be diſtinguiſhed from it, yet it can no more be ſeparated or divided from it, then heate from fire, or motion from life.</p>
                  <p>Yet I concave, that <hi>Bildad</hi> in this place doth not ſpeake of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification in that ſtrict Goſpel ſence, as it imports the pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of a man righteous, for the ſake of Chriſt, or as if he ſuppoſed <hi>Job</hi> looked to be pronounced righteous for his owne ſake. But <hi>Bildad</hi> ſpeakes of Juſtification here, as to ſome particular act; As for inſtance, If any man will contend with God (and that <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad</hi> chargeth <hi>Job</hi> with) as if God had done him ſome wrong, or had afflicted him more then was need, is he able to make this plea good, and give proofe of before the Throne of God; <hi>How can man be Juſtified with God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a fourefold underſtanding of that phraſe, <hi>with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Thus; <hi>If any man ſhall preſume to referre himſelfe to the Judgement of God, ſhall he be juſtified?</hi> (all at laſt muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before the Judgement of God, whether they will referre themſelves to him or no; but) ſuppoſe a man referre himſelfe to God (as <hi>Job</hi> had done by appealing to him) <hi>can he be Juſtified?</hi> Will God upon the tryall &amp; examination of his cauſe give Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or ſentence for him? But in this ſence it is poſſible for a man to be juſtified with God; and thus <hi>Job</hi> was juſtified by God at laſt againſt the opinion and cenſures of his three friends.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>To be Juſtified with God,</hi> is as much as this, <hi>If man come neere to, or ſet himſelfe in the preſence of God, ſhall he be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?</hi> Man uſually lookes upon himſelfe at a diſtance from God,
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:153845:365"/> he looks upon himſelfe in his owne light, and ſo thinkes himſelfe righteous; but when he lookes upon himſelfe in the light of God, and as one that is neer God; will not all his ſpots and blemiſhes then appeare, or rather will not he himſelfe appeare all ſpot and blemiſh? When he is once with God, will he be any thing with himſelfe, but an impure and wretched creature? In this ſence <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad</hi> might check <hi>Jobs</hi> boldnes in deſiering to come ſo neere God, <hi>even to his ſeate,</hi> which would but have made him more vile in his owne eyes, and diſcovered to him his owne impurities, as it did to the Prophet <hi>Iſayah</hi> (Chap. 6.5.) and as it did alſo to <hi>Job</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, when he attained his wiſh, and got ſo neere to God, that he called it <hi>a ſeeing him with his eye</hi> (Chap: 42.5.) Then we have not a word more of pleading his cauſe before God; His mouth was ſtopt, <hi>and he abhorred himſelfe, repenting in duſt and aſhes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Can man be juſtified with God?</hi> that is, if man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelfe with God, an he be juſtified? one man may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelfe with another and be juſtified. And thus, the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full people of God are called righteous and juſt in Scripture, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively, to wicked and unrighteous men. But how can any man be juſt or righteous compared with God, in compariſon of whom all our righteouſneſſe is unrighteous, and our very cleanenes filthy?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>To be juſtified with God,</hi> is, <hi>againſt God;</hi> that is, if man ſtrive or contend with God, in any thing, as if God were too hard and ſevere towards him, eyther by withholding good from him, or bringing evill upon him; can man be juſtifyed in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, or will God be found to have done him any wrong? with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all queſtion he will not.</p>
                  <p>From the words taken in a generall ſence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>Man hath nothing of his owne to Juſtifie him before God.</q>
                  <p>There are two things conſiderable in man; firſt, his ſinne; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, his righteouſneſſe; his worſt and his beſt; all grant man cannot be juſtified by or for his ſins, nor can he at all be juſtifyed in or for his owne righteouſneſſe. And that upon a twofold ground.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe the beſt of his righteouſneſſe is Imperfect; and no Imperfect thing can be a ground of Juſtification and acceptance with God. For though God doth juſtifie thoſe who are imperfect,
<pb n="703" facs="tcp:153845:365"/> yet hee never juſtified any man upon the account of that which is Imperfect. God never tooke cockle-ſhels for payment, he muſt have pure gold, and he ſeeth wel enough what poore ſtuffe, what baſe coyne the beſt of our righteouſneſſe is, and therefore cannot admit any of it in juſtification. For the purpoſe of God is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt himſelfe in Juſtice as wel as in mercy by the juſtification of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. And therefore the Apoſtle ſayth (<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25, 26.) That <hi>God hath ſet forth Chriſt to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſſe</hi> (and he is not content to ſay it once, but ſaith it againe) <hi>To declare, I ſay, his righteouſneſſe, that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him that beleeveth in Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, All the righteouſneſſe wrought by man is a due debt; how can wee acquit our ſelves from the evill wee have done by any good which we doe, ſeeing all the good we doe, we ought to have done, though we had never done any evill? When we have done our beſt we may be aſhamed of our doings, we do ſo poorly. But ſuppoſe we had done richly and bravely; ſuppoſe our workes (which indeed are full of droſſe) were pure gold and ſilver, were precious ſtones and Jewels, yet they are already due to God. Wee owe all and all manner of obedience as wee are creatures; And wee can never juſtifie our ſelves from our tranſgreſſions, by ſatisfying (could we reach them) our obligations. There is enough in Chriſt to juſtifie us, but there is nothing in our ſelves; All that Chriſt did was perfect, and Chriſt was under no obligation to doe any thing, but what he willingly ſubmitted to doe for us. This booke of <hi>Job</hi> beareth as great a teſtimony to this truth as any; How often doth <hi>Job</hi> diſclaime all <hi>ſelfe-Juſtification</hi> (Chap. 9.20, 21.) <hi>If I juſtifie my ſelfe, mine owne mouth ſhall condemne mee: if I ſay I am perfect, it ſhall alſo prove mee perverſe. Though I were perfect, yet would not I know my owne ſoule, I would deſpiſe my life.</hi> What can be ſayd more fully (to the tenour of the Goſpel) for the abaſement of ſelfe, and the advancement of free grace in juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. He ſayd indeed (<hi>Chap.</hi> 13.18.) <hi>Behold now I have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered my cauſe. I know that I ſhall be juſtified.</hi> But he never ſayd that he ſhould be juſtified for the cauſe ſake which he had orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. There is a twofold juſtification.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The juſtification of a man in reference unto ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular act, or in his cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The juſtification of a man in his perſon. When <hi>Job</hi>
                     <pb n="704" facs="tcp:153845:366"/> ſayd, <hi>I know that I ſhall be juſtified,</hi> his meaning was, I ſhall be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, in this caſe, in this buiſines, I ſhall not be caſt as an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite (for hee alwayes ſtood upon and ſtiffely maintained his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity) or I know I ſhall be juſtified in this opinion which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly maintaine; That a righteous man may be greatly afflicted by God, while in the meane time hee ſpareth the unrighteous and the ſinner. A man may have much to juſtifie himſelfe by before God, as to a controverſie between him and man; but he hath nothing at all to juſtifie himſelfe by as to his ſtate towards God.</p>
                  <p>Againe, As theſe words are referred to <hi>Jobs</hi> complaint of the ſeverity of Gods dealings with him.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>Whoſoever complaines of the diſpenſations of God towards him, cannot be juſtified in it.</q>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>Jewes</hi> of old complained (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.25.) <hi>Ye ſay the way of the Lord is not equall.</hi> But were they juſtified in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, with God? How doth the Lord expoſtulate with them, in the next words. <hi>Heare O houſe of Iſrael, is not my way equall? is not your way unequall.</hi> As if he had ſayd; All the inequality is on your part, there is none on mine. The wayes of God, how hard and grievous ſoever they may be (as they were towards <hi>Job</hi>) yet unequall or unrighteous they can never be. The uſuall dealings of God with us are full of mercy, &amp; his ſevereſt dealings with us have no want of Juſtice. <hi>How then can man be Juſtified with God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Or how then can he be clean that is borne of a woman?</q>
                  <p>Here's another queſtion of the ſame tenour, and in the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>Chap: ver:</hi> 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpake almoſt in the ſame termes, <hi>What is man that he ſhould be clean? and hee that is borne of a woman that hee ſhould be righteous? Jobs</hi> friends beate often upon this poynt, vehemently ſuſpecting that he did over-weene his owne condition, and thought too highly of himſelfe. Whereas <hi>Job</hi> did not onely freely and ingeniouſly, but with a great deale of holy rhetorique and elegancy confeſſe againſt himſelfe againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that hee neither was nor could be cleane before God; Onely hee would not admit their plea againſt him, that hee ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for his uncleanenes, or that hee was uncleane becauſe he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>
                  <pb n="705" facs="tcp:153845:366"/>
                  <p>Maſter <hi>Broughton</hi> tranſlates thus; <hi>Or, The borne of woman locke to be cleared.</hi> We ſay; <hi>How can hee be cleane that is borne of a woman?</hi> that is, how can hee have a nature at all cleane, or be altogether cleane in his life, who commeth into the world through a world of uncleanenes? Can the ſtreame be cleane, when the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine is uncleane? or the product be better then that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced? Man borne of a woman by natural generation (ſo <hi>Bildad</hi> is to be underſtood) comes from an uncleane fountaine, from an impure Original, and therefore, how can he be pure or cleane? What the particular Emphaſis and importance of this phraſe <hi>(To be borne of a woman)</hi> is, hath been opened already (<hi>Chap:</hi> 14.1. <hi>Chap:</hi> 15.14.) and therefore I referre the reader to thoſe texts for a further Expoſition. And ſhall here onely give out this Obſervation.</p>
                  <q>All men borne of a woman by natural generation are impure and uncleane.</q>
                  <p>There was never but one man, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, borne of a woman who was not uncleane, and he was borne of a woman, not in an ordinary, but miraculous way; <hi>The holy Ghoſt ſhall come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, and the power of the moſt high ſhall overſhadow thee</hi> (Luk. 1.35.) All elſe borne of a woman have been and are uncleane. It is ſayd (<hi>Gen.</hi> 5.3.) <hi>Adam lived an hundred and thirty yeares, and begat a Son in his owne likenes, after his Image, and called his name Seth. Adam begat a ſon in his owne likenes;</hi> what likenes? it is not meant of his outward likenes, of the figure or feature of his body, that was the leaſt part of the likenes there intended, in which his ſon was borne; every father begets a ſon in a humane ſhape; and we ſay the child is like his father, not onely as having the ſame ſpecifical nature, but as having the perſonal figure and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his father. But when it is ſayd, <hi>Adam begat a ſon in his owne likenes, in his Image,</hi> the meaning is, he begat a ſon that was a ſinner as himſelfe was, and corrupt as himſelfe was, even <hi>Seth,</hi> who was given in the place of <hi>Abel.</hi> God in the creation made man in his image after his likenes; Man by procreation begets a ſon, not in Gods image, but in his owne; And that not onely like him in conſtitution as a man, but in corruption as a ſinner. <hi>David</hi> confeſſeth of himſelfe (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5.) <hi>Behold I was ſhapen in Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and in ſin did my mother conceive mee.</hi> Some to avoyd the
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:153845:367"/> ſtrength and dint of that text, as to the proofe of the corruption of nature by propagation, put a moſt corrupt and baſe gloſſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; As if <hi>David</hi> had therein onely confeſſed his parents ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnes or inordinate affections in begetting and conceaving him; not his owne natural ſinfulnes as begotten and conceaved. I know no better argument of the corruption of nature, then ſuch cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt interpretations of Scripture; For doubtleſſe as <hi>Bildad</hi> here in the Text, ſo <hi>David</hi> was acquainted not onely with the doctrine of original ſin, and the corruption of nature, but had found and felt the ſad effects of it in himſelfe, And from that experience could ſay, <hi>I was ſhapen in iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. as alſo conſent to what <hi>Bildad</hi> ſaith in this place, <hi>What is man that is borne of a woman that hee ſhould be clean?</hi> doe but acknowledge that any one is borne ordinarily of a woman, and wee may conclude him to be ſinfull and uncleane. That I may make this a litle clearer, I ſhall touch at three things, which are diſtinctly conſiderable in the ſin of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, That particular act, or fact againſt the Law, which he committed in eating the forbidden fruit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The legal guilt that flowed from that act, both up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his perſon and upon his poſterity.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The naturall Corruption which as a conſequent of the former ſtayned all mankinde. Or there was firſt the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Commandement, which was his eating the forbidden fruit; Secondly, there was the puniſhment of that tranſgreſſion, which was death inflicted for eating; thirdly, the depravation of the whole maſſe of mans nature, by which, as <hi>Bildad</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Every man borne of a woman is uncleane.</hi> And theſe three fell upon the whole poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> or upon all that are borne of a woman in a threefold way.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The very act of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin becometh ours, for wee did participate with him, and had, as it were, a hand in it, becauſe wee all were ſeminally in him; ſo that when he ſinned, wee all ſinned being in his loynes long before we were borne, as <hi>Levi</hi> paid tythes in <hi>Abraham</hi> before hee was borne (<hi>Heb.</hi> 7.9.10.) Thus wee all ſinned in his ſinning, and had a ſhare in that act of his, becauſe hee ſtood as the roote of mankinde, and as having entred a covenant with God in that capacity. For he ſinned, not onely as a ſingle perſon, but as hee was the repreſentative of all mankinde, and
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:153845:367"/> therefore what hee did we are reckoned as doing the ſame with him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The guilt of that ſin is ours by particular Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the fact is ours by common participation; for as if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood in a ſtate of Innocency, that had redounded to us for good, ſo his fall or ſin redoundeth to us for evill.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is the pravity or corruption of nature, iſſuing from that firſt ſin, and that is chiefly aymed at in the preſent text. And this is derived to us by propagation. The defilement of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deſcendeth and paſſeth from generation to generation: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>how can hee that is borne of a woman be clean?</hi> and that defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath two things in it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The loſſe of original purity, or the defaceing and blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of the image of God in which man was created.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A ſucceſſion of horrible deformity and diſorder, which conſiſteth, firſt, in a pronenes to all evill; ſecondly, in an impotency and weakenes, yea in an averſenes from and enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all that is good. So then, we have to doe with the very act of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin by participation, with the guilt of it by imputation, and with the filth and deformity of it by propagation: From all which it may wel be queſtioned, <hi>How can hee be cleane that is borne of a woman,</hi> and concluded, <hi>Every man borne of a woman is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane.</hi>

                  <p>In this verſe <hi>Bildad</hi> proceedeth to argue downe the preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as hee conceived) of <hi>Job,</hi> by calling him to conſider thoſe things which are farre below God, and yet were farre above him; as if he had ſaid; <hi>Wilt thou contend with God, when thou canſt not contend with the Moone and Starres? they have a brightnes beyond any thing of thine, why then doeſt thou inſiſt ſo ſtiffely upon the ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of thy converſation towards men, and the brightnes of thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity towards God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Behold, even to the Moone and it ſhineth not.</q>
                  <p>There is a twofold underſtanding of theſe words; firſt, ſome expound them by deſcending; as if <hi>Bildad</hi> had ſpoken thus; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:153845:368"/> O Job, and be both aſhamed of and aſtoniſhed at thy owne folly, in venturing upon a tryal before God, who is of ſuch infinite purity, that while he looketh upon all theſe heavenly lights that are above the Moone, even to or as low as the Moone, which (as Aſtronomers teach) is the loweſt of all the planets, it ſhineth not, there is no brightnes, no beauty in any of them; They are all in compariſon of God but clouds and darkenes, but clods of earth and dirt. And if they ſhine not in the eye of God, ſurely much leſſe doeſt thou, who art a worme, and but a clod of moving or breathing earth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others expound it by aſcending. As if <hi>Bildad</hi> had ſpoken thus; <hi>Behold, O Job, and tremble at thy preſumption in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring that God ſhould take ſo exact a ſcrutiny of thee &amp; of thy cauſe; for look upon all the parts of the inferiour viſible world, look upon all their glories and excellencies, and look not only upon thoſe things that are creeping here upon the Earth, but lift up thine eyes as high as the Moone it ſelfe, Behold even to the Moone (which is, as it were the boundary between the upper and the lower world; The Moone being the loweſt of the upper world, and the higheſt of the lower world, now ſaith</hi> Bildad, <hi>ſurveigh the world up to the Moone) and it ſhineth not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But doth not <hi>the Moone ſhine?</hi> yes! the Moone ſhineth, the Moone is <hi>that leſſer light which was made to rule the night</hi> (Gen. 1.16.) Why then doth hee ſay <hi>it ſhineth not?</hi> the meaning is onely this, that Moone-light, and Sun-light, that all creature-light is no light, nor their ſhining to be called ſhining, when we ſpeake of the light and ſhinings of God himſelfe. The Moone ſhineth for the uſe and to the eye of man, but the Moone ſhineth not for any uſe to or in the eye of God. As becauſe he is light, he needeth no light, ſo becauſe there was no light till he created it, the light of the creature is nothing unto him.</p>
                  <p>The Moone and Starres ſhine, but when the Sunne is up they ſhine not, that is, not to our view; the Starres ſhine as much in the day as in the night, though wee cannot ſee them being over-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by that greater light, the light of the Sunne; So when the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Lord appeareth, both Sunne and Moone diſappeare, and are no moore ſeene.<note place="margin">Ne luna quidem lucida eſt colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta eum deo. <hi>Vatabl.</hi>
                     </note> The light of the world is no light where God is named; doe but ſpeake of God, and all the beauty and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the creature fades and is extinct. The Moone is a very beautifull creature conſidered by it ſelfe, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes to ſhew
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:153845:368"/> how farre he was from idolizing it, notwithſtanding all that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wherein it appeared to him (<hi>Chap.</hi> 31.26.) <hi>If I beheld the Sunne when it ſhined, or the Moone walking in brightneſſe?</hi> that is, if I beheld eyther Sunne or Moone ſo as to adore and worſhip them; if I reckoned any thing of Moone and Sunne, in compariſon of God, if I did not judge the light of both as darknes and obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in reference to him, if I did not behold them ſo as if I did not behold them, not being taken up or dazzl'd at all with their ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brightnes, ſcarſe at all ſeeing, not at all admiring any brightnes, but the brightnes of God, if it were not thus with me, if I ſtood not at this diſtance, and upon theſe termes with the beſt of the creatures, then, &amp;c. It argues that there is much natural beauty in the Moone, when as <hi>Job</hi> to ſhew his ſpirituall chaſtity ſaith that the beauty of it, did not at all withdraw or ſteale away his heart from God. Indeed ſuch is the beauty of the Moone that it is uſed to ſhadow out the Church in her ſpirituall beauty (<hi>Cant.</hi> 6.10.) <hi>Who is ſhee that looketh forth as the morning, faire as the Moone;</hi> The Moone is fayre, yet ſhe hath her ſpots; But God is fayre without any ſpot, and therefore the fayrenes of the Moone is no fayrenes at all to his.</p>

                  <p>The Starres are ſuppoſed higher and greater then the Moone; The Starres are pure and ſplendid bodies, as hath been ſhewed from other places of this booke.

                  <p>When God had finiſhed the worke of Creation, it is ſayd (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31.) <hi>And God ſaw all that he had made, and behold it was very good.</hi> How then is it ſayd here, that <hi>the Moone ſhineth not, and that the Starres are not pure in his ſigh?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt as before, all things which God made were good as creatures, but nothing was as good as the Creator.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I anſwer, the creature is not now ſo good as it was when firſt created, the ſin of man did not onely pollute and ſtaine the glory of man, but of the whole creation; and therefore the Apoſtle ſayth (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.20, 21, 22.) <hi>That the creature was made ſubject to vanity, not willingly but by reaſon of him who hath ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the ſame in hope, becauſe the creature it ſelfe alſo ſhall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God, for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travelleth in paine together untill now.</hi> From this illuſtrious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text it appeares that God for mans ſin hath put the whole creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to diſgrace and ſuffering, and that all creatures are fallen from their firſt perfection by the fall of the firſt man; The very lights of heaven are made darke, and the Starres impure, by mans impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.

<pb n="713" facs="tcp:153845:370"/> and the ſon of man, is no better, a worme or vermin.

And againe (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.5.) <hi>To whom will yee liken mee, and make mee equall, and compare mee, that wee may be like?</hi> that is, there is nothing that you can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare or make mee like unto, I am above all compariſon — Now (I ſay) as it ſhewes the excellency of God, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worthy to be compared to him, ſo it ſhewes the meanenes of man, that there is nothing ſo unworthy but that he may be compared to it, and that without wrong or diſparagement. The Scripture doth as it were ſtrive for Compariſons, to ſet forth the weaknes, the poorenes, the worthleſnes of man; hee is compared to, yea called duſt (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19.) <hi>Duſt thou art, and to duſt thou ſhalt returne.</hi> Hee is compared to the graſſe of the feild that groweth to day, but withereth or is cut downe to morrow (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.6) Hee is compar'd unto a ſhadow that hath nothing of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity or ſubſtance, and therefore continueth not but vaniſheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way (<hi>Job</hi> 14.2.) Hee is compar'd to that which is leſſe then a ſhadow, even to that which is, as I may ſay, <hi>the nothingnes of all things, vanity;</hi> and thus hee is called when at his beſt or in his beſt eſtate (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.5.) Further, man is not onely nothing and leſſe then nothing, but that which is worſe then nothing <hi>a ly,</hi> hee is naturally under ſuch diſgrace, that he is the very <hi>word of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, a ly. Surely</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 62.9.) <hi>men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a ly.</hi> Nor doth the Lord ſpeake thus of ſingle perſons onely, but of Nations, and not onely of this or that Nation, but of all Nations; take mankind in a cluſter, or as bundled up together; not onely is this or that man, this or that Nation, but all men and all Nations <hi>before him are as nothing, and are counted to him leſſe then nothing and vanity</hi> (Iſa. 40.17.) They are not onely duſt, but (which is the lighteſt and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable duſt) <hi>the duſt of the ballance,</hi> and that the ſmalleſt duſt of the ballance (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.15.) they are not onely a drop, but <hi>the drop of a bucket,</hi> which is but the drop of a drop. The ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in the Text layeth man low enough, <hi>He is a worme.</hi> When
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:153845:371"/> the Lord would ſpeake of his people at the loweſt rate in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the opinion which they had of themſelves, or which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had of them, hee calls them <hi>a worme,</hi> (Iſa. 41.14.) <hi>Feare not thou worme Jacob, and yee men of Iſrael:</hi> God doth not ſpeake this to the diſparagement, or to the diſcouragement of <hi>Jacob,</hi> but to the comfort of <hi>Jacob;</hi> As if he had ſaid, though thou art a worm, though thou art thus low, thus mean, humbly in thy own thoughts, contemptuouſly in the thoughts of others, yet feare not, yea all ſhall have cauſe to be afraid of thee, for though thou art a worme, yet thou <hi>ſhalt threſh the nations and beate them ſmall</hi> &amp;c. As National <hi>Jacob</hi> then, ſo perſonal <hi>Jacob,</hi> or <hi>Jacob</hi> in perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was but a worme in his owne eyes. (<hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10.) <hi>I am not worthy of the leaſt of all the mercies (or I am leſſe then all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies) and of all the truth which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſervant, for with my ſtaffe I paſſed over this Jordan;</hi> that is, I came over in a very poore manner, all my ſtate was but a ſtaffe. Here <hi>Jacob</hi> in perſon ſpake of himſelfe as a worme; <hi>and when wee ſpeake thus like wormes, wee ſpeake moſt like Saints.</hi> Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſpake thus of himſelfe, as for our ſakes he became poore and emptyed himſelfe, as for our ſakes <hi>he tooke upon him the forme of a ſervant, and was made in the likenes of man.</hi> (Pſal. 22.6.) <hi>I am a worme and no man, a reproach of men, and deſpiſed of the people.</hi> O how low did Chriſt eſteeme and ſet himſelfe, as, and while he ſtood in the place of ſinners? He not onely confeſſed that he was a worme, becauſe a man, but that he was a worme and no man. How then ought every ſinfull man to abaſe himſelfe and ſay, <hi>I am a worme and no man.</hi> Man is a worme in a five-fold reſpect.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Looke upon his original and conſtitution, hee is from the earth as the worme is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Looke upon him in his natural ſtate and condition, hee liveth upon the earth and earthly things, as wormes doe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Hee is a worme, becauſe continually ſubject to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, every foot may cruſh him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, As the worme is very ſubject to danger, ſo likewiſe unable to reſiſt, or make defence; the worme is a naked creature, and weares no armes, neyther offenſive nor defenſive. Such a one is man, a worme, unable to defend himſelfe, unleſſe the Lord be his ſhield and a defence to him round about.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Man is a worme, for hee muſt ſhortly returne into the
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:153845:371"/> Earth where the wormes are houſed; hee is going to wormes, as a worme, and when he comes to the grave it will be worme to worme. As the Lord ſayd, <hi>Duſt thou art and to duſt thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne;</hi> ſo wee may ſay, a worme thou art, and to wormes thou ſhalt returne. Thus wee ſee man is a poore thing, a very poore thing, and hence I ſhall make foure or five briefe inferences.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Let no man be proud, or have high thoughts of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; the ſon of man is but a worme; O why doth man ſwel above the clouds, or proudly make his neſt among the Starres, when as he muſt ſhortly fall among the clods, and as he is a worme, ſo be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten up of wormes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Let men take heed of adorning one another with great words and flattering titles, let us take heed of having the perſons of men in admiration; it is as vaine a thing, for any man to give great flattering titles to others, as it is to have high thoughts of himſelfe. The titles which the Spirit of God gives to man, are humbling titles, a flower, a ſhadow, &amp;c. any thing which may keep downe his ſpirit and abate <hi>ſelfe</hi>-valuations; we ſhould learne as to thinke of our ſelves, ſo to ſpeake of other men as the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh. As he doth not paint man out with praiſes, nor ſpeake of him as Courtiers (whoſe hearts are the ſhops of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, and their tongues the venters of them) doe of Princes. So neyther ſhould we: There are two extreames which wee ſhould labour exceedingly to avoyd in our references to men; and yet moſt men walke in one of theſe extreames towards men. Firſt, we ſhould take heed or reproaching, vilifying, and deſpiſing others; for though it be a duty for every man to thinke meanely of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and to ſay of himſelfe, I am a worme; and though wee may lawfully thinke and ſay ſo of all men, as to the general truth of the propoſition, yet it is ſo farre from being a duty, that it is not at all lawfull to call any man worme, with reproach and contempt of the meanenes of his perſon. Secondly, we ſhould take heed of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering and daubing others, as thoſe <hi>Tyrians</hi> did <hi>Herod, crying out it is the voyce of God and not of man</hi> (Acts 12.22.) whereas God to ſhew their miſtake, and that he was indeed but a worme, ſmote him, and he was eaten up of wormes. <hi>Elihu</hi> concludes and reſolves excellently to this poynt (<hi>Job</hi> 32.21, 22.) <hi>Let me not, I pray you, accept any mans perſon, neyther let me give flattering titles unto man, for I know not to give flattering titles, in ſo doing my maker
<pb n="716" facs="tcp:153845:372"/> would ſoone take me away.</hi> As God tooke away <hi>Herod</hi> for recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving flattering titles, ſo they who give them are in danger to be taken away by God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Be not Envious at others; what if another have a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more glory, riches, beauty, ſtrength, power, then thou haſt, what though he have a little more knowledge, and be a little high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in gifts then others, yet hee is but a worme ſtill; what's man but a worme, and what's the ſon of man, (the beſt of men) but a worme? why ſhould a worme Envy a worme, what though ſome men are <hi>ſilke wormes,</hi> a little better furniſhed and richer then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in mind and body, yet they are but wormes in ſilke, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who appeare ſo, are but <hi>Glow-wormes,</hi> which ſhine a little but have no conſiſtence.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Let the ſons of men take heed of vexing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; why ſhould wormes riſe up againſt wormes, why ſhould wormes deſtroy wormes cruelly, bloodily? Wee are all weake as wormes, let us therefore engage that little ſtrength wee have, for the ſupporting, not for the ruining of one another. Wee uſually have ſo much tendernes towards wormes in kinde, that when wee ſee them crawling upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ground, we avoyd treading upon them; yet how doe men purpoſely tread upon wormes in likenes. All men are wormes in likenes, we ſhould not willingly tread upon or hurt any man. But poore men, and men of low degree, are more wormes then rich men, and men in high places are, therefore take heed of oppreſſing the poore, for that is indeed, a treading upon wormes. And though while you tread upon wormes the weake and needy, they cannot (as Chriſt ſpeakes of ſwine, <hi>Math.</hi> 7.6.) <hi>turne againe and rent you,</hi> yet if you doe ſo, God, the ſtrong God will turne upon you and teare you while there is none to deliver.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Take this inference from it.</p>
                  <q>Man by ſin is much degraded and fallen below himſelfe.</q>
                  <p>Man by ſin is become inferiour to the meaneſt creatures, who was once above all viſible creatures: man in the ſtate of Creation was the chiefe piece of the viſible world, hee was next to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, who are of the Inviſible world, but now man is fallen very low, he is levell'd with the loweſt of the Creatures, a worme; not onely doe the heavenly bodyes exceed him in beauty, but even the earthly bodyes, the beaſts of the field, and the worme that crawles
<pb n="717" facs="tcp:153845:372"/> upon the earth, and lives in the bowels of it, is good enough to make compariſon with him. See what man hath loſt by ſin! ſee how hee is degraded and fallen from his ſtate and ſtatelynes! yea I may ſay that man by ſin is not onely fallen from that ſtate and ſtatelynes wherein he was created, but he is fallen below the ſtate of the loweſt creature. Man (by ſin) is not onely a worme but worſe then a worme; A worme is not capable of morall polution; a toad hath naturall poyſon, but man hath morall poyſon in him, which is worſe then naturall poyſon; and which makes the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man yet more vile, his moral poyſon (ſin I meane) is to him naturall. It is his miſery and his diſhonour that he hath it, and it is his greater miſery and diſhonour, that he loves it, and that it is not ſo much his diſeaſe as his deſire: and as the firſt ſin, the ſin of nature hath debaſed all mankinde at once; ſo every man that goeth on in and multiplyeth (with deſire) the acts of ſin, debaſeth himſelfe yet more, and maketh himſelfe not onely lower then the worme, which is the loweſt of living things, but even low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then the loweſt things that have no life. Senceleſſe liveleſſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are better then ſinfull men, ſuch I meane as live in ſin, and better it had been for any never to have had a being, or not to have lived at all, then to dye in ſin.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then ſin hath degraded us, and placed us among and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the wormes, who were once next to Angels, how are we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to Jeſus Chriſt, who by becoming a worme for us, hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed us to be heyres of bleſſedneſs with the holy Angels for ever, and hath lifted us up to that hight of honour, that even the holy Angels miniſter to us as long as we are here. And how ſhould we ſtrive to raiſe our ſelves up higher and higher in the Improvement of all that grace which is freely offered to us in Chriſt, even to our dayly <hi>converſation in heaven, and our ſitting together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeakes (<hi>Eph.</hi> 2.16.) It is ſad for any man who is but a worme, to be lifted up in himſelfe, but it is the duty of every man to ſtrive that he may be lifted up, not onely above the wormes, but above the heavens. Wee may quickly ſin in ſeeking our owne exaltation in a worldly, But the more we ſeeke our exaltation in a heavenly ſtate, the more holy, yea the more humble we are. Wee never act as thoſe who know they are but wormes here on earth, till we have an ambition to be like the Angels who are in heaven.</p>

                     </note> and may as wel be rendred, <hi>that, which hath no power, as, him that hath no power.</hi> And the thing without power, which this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation aymes at, is the opinion or tenet which <hi>Bildad,</hi> and his friends had held forth in their diſcourſe: which <hi>Job</hi> is conceived to looke upon, as weake, and without power, as having neyther ſtrength nor wiſdome in it. And becauſe <hi>Bildad</hi> made the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, <hi>Job</hi> (according to this expoſition) beſpeaks him thus; <hi>Thine owne former arguments, as alſo thoſe of thy friends, had no power, no ſtrength of reaſon, nor true wiſdome in them, and haſt thou mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the matter now, haſt thou by what thou ſpakeſt laſt put any ſtrength into what hath been weakly and feebly argued already?

As if <hi>Job</hi> had ſayd, <hi>O Bildad, thou haſt ſtood up in the defence of God, as if he had not been able to defend himſelfe, thou haſt been an Advocate for him, who hath no need thou ſhouldeſt. Hath not he power? hath his arme no ſtrength in it? or is he deſtitute of counſel? ſurely God hath no need of thy patronage, or aſſiſtance? Therefore conſider whoſe hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per haſt thou been? what? the helper of him that is weake, and haſt thou ſuſtained the armes of him that hath no ſtrength? ſurely no, God hath ſtrength enough to defend his own cauſe, and wiſdome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to maintaine his own acts againſt me and all men elſe. Thou oughteſt indeed to have helped him that hath no power, but thou haſt onely given helpe to him that hath all power.</hi> Thus ſome cary on the
<pb n="721" facs="tcp:153845:374"/> whole context under that frame and forme of this expoſition, as if <hi>Job</hi> did but rebuke <hi>Bildad</hi> for undertaking the matter on Gods part, whereas he ſhould have uſed his utmoſt endeavours for the ſupport and comfort of him a poore weake creature, labouring under heavy burdens of moſt ſad afflictions, and wanting counſel, how to beare and improve them as layed upon him by the hand of God. For this <hi>Job</hi> had no power and might expect helpe from his friend; but he beſtowed all his helpe in vindicating the honour of God againſt <hi>Job,</hi> not in helping or adviſing <hi>Job</hi> how to beare up under the hand of God, and therefore he thus interrogates him, <hi>How haſt thou helped him that hath no power?</hi> But</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I rather expound the words of <hi>Job</hi> himſelfe, as being now burdened and diſtreſſed with great affliction, and under ſore temptations, and therefore fitly repreſented in theſe words, <hi>a man without power, an arme without ſtrength, and him that had no wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi> at leaſt that he was ſuch in the opinion and judgement of his friends. As if he had ſayd, <hi>O Bildad, Thou lookeſt upon me as a man without power, ſtrength, or wiſdome; very well, be it ſo as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (though not in thy ſence) it is ſo, what haſt thou done? how haſt thou helped him that is without power? how ſaveſt thou the arme that hath no ſtrength? how haſt thou performed the part of a friend, eyther in comforting me, or in counſelling me?</hi> ſo the words are a cloſe Ironicall rebuke of what <hi>Bildad</hi> ſayd in the former Chapter. <hi>Thou cameſt to ſtrengthen and helpe me, conſider how well thou haſt made good thy owne intendment; how haſt thou helped him that is without power? thou haſt ſpoken words fitter to weaken, then to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, to caſt downe then to raiſe up; and ſo haſt quite miſtaken the matter. Thou ſhouldeſt not have amplyfyed the power and majeſty of God before a man in my condition, Thou ſhouldeſt rather have opened the doctrine of free-grace, and of the fatherly affection of God to his poore ſervants and children, while they are under his ſharpeſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections: Thy words ſhould have been like oyle, like milke and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but thou haſt ſpoken very hard words if not gall and wormewood to my wearied ſoule. Though what thou haſt ſpoken be in it ſelfe true, yet it is to me improper and unſuitable, out of time and unſeaſonable, and therefore weigh with thy ſelfe; How haſt thou helped him that is without power?</hi> We may paralel this context with that of the Apoſtle, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8.10.) where with much holy deriſion he rebukes the over-weening and high opinion which the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>

<q>How ſaveſt thou the arme that hath no ſtrength?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The arme is an eminent member of the body, and in Scripture it often ſignifies ſtrength, becauſe the arme holdeth out and acteth the ſtrength of the whole body; <hi>How haſt thou ſaved the arme that hath no ſtrength?</hi> that is, the man that hath no ſtrength. There is a threefold ſtrength; firſt, naturall, which is twofold; firſt, of the mind or inward parts; ſecondly, of the body or outward parts: ſecondly, there is a civill ſtrength, which is the command or Authority which a man hath over others; thirdly, there is a ſpirituall ſtrength, which is the command which a man hath over himſelfe, both in doing good and in avoyding evill, or both for the due enjoyment of good and induring of evill. When, <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>How ſaveſt thou the arme that hath no ſtrength?</hi> we may expound it both of the firſt and third ſort of ſtrength. For <hi>Job</hi> had indeed loſt the ſtrength of his body, and his friends thought he had loſt the ſtrength both of his parts and graces. Which is more cleare in the next interrogation.</p>

For the neglect of this duty, the Lord reproves the Shepheards (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.2, 3, 4.) <hi>Son of man propheſie againſt the Shepheards of Iſrael, prophecy and ſay unto them, thus ſaith the Lord God unto the Shepheards; Woe be to the Shepheards of Iſrael, that doe feed themſelves, ſhould not the Shepheards feed the flockes?</hi> That is, ſhould they not be more intent upon the feeding of their

A body exerciſed and a ſoule ſitting ſtill, is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.

So the Lord will put ſuch a queſtion to many of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers; <hi>How have ye worſhipped him that hath all power?</hi> how ſlightly, how formally, how hypocritically have ye done it? Therefore in all duties, <hi>looke to the manner, as well as to the matter, and labour to doe them well, as well as to doe them.</hi> To neglect the doing of a duty, or the doing of it negligently, are alike offenſive unto God; and he will ſay to the latter with as much diſpleaſure, <hi>How haſt thou done what I commanded?</hi> as he will to the latter, <hi>Why haſt thou not done what I commanded?</hi> yea</p>

                  <p>That which we ſtrive not to doe in a right manner, we (upon the matter) doe not at all. We may reſolve theſe interrogations of the Text into negations, <hi>How haſt thou helped him that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out power?</hi> is as much as this, <hi>thou haſt not helped him: how ſaveſt thou the arme that hath no ſtrength?</hi> is indeed, <hi>Thou haſt not ſaved him: how haſt thou counſelled him that hath no wiſdome?</hi> caryeth this meaning, <hi>thou haſt given him no counſell;</hi> we uſe to ſay, <hi>as good never a whit, as never the better,</hi> and how good ſoever any thing is that we doe, if we doe it amiſſe, it will be reckoned by God (what reckoning ſoever men make of it) as if we had done no ſuch thing. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to the Lord under a temptation, when he was troubled at the complaint of the people, becauſe the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance promiſed did not come on, and they were not freed as was expected; <hi>Lord, wherefore haſt thou ſo evill entreated this people? why is it that thou haſt ſent me? for ſince I came to Pharaoh to ſpeake in thy name, he hath done evill to this people, neither haſt thou delivered thy people at all,</hi> (Exod. 5.23.) Is this a deliverance? this is no deliverance; we are apt to thinke the mercyes of God no mercyes, unleſſe he give us full and perfect mercyes, unleſſe we preſently receave all that we looke for, we looke upon it as if we had receaved nothing at all. But how truely may the Lord ſay to the children of men, when they performe duties ſlightly, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, ye have not done them at all, ye have neyther prayed, nor heard, nor faſted at all, becauſe ye have been negligent in, and unprofitable under them. The workes and dutyes of the beſt are not every way full, but the workes and dutyes of ſome are alltoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther empty; and they doe nothing in all they doe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In theſe ſeverall interrogations, are here held forth the ſeverall effects of holy advice given according to the word, and minde of God; <hi>how haſt thou helped him that is without power? ſaved the arme that hath no ſtrength? counſelled him that hath no wiſdome?</hi> As if he had ſayd, thou indeed haſt offered me counſell from God; if thou hadſt managed it right, this would have been the fruit of it; I who have no power ſhould have been helped, and I who am as an arme without ſtrength ſhould have been ſaved</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>That the word of God or divine truths are mighty in operation, when duely adminiſtred.</q>
                  <p>The word of truth conveigheth ſtrength to the weake, wiſdome
<pb n="728" facs="tcp:153845:379"/> to the ſimple, comfort to the ſorrowfull, light to thoſe who are in darkenes, and life unto the dead. The word <hi>lifts up the hands which hang downe, and the feeble knees. The law of the Lord</hi> (that is, every holy truth, ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 19.7, 8.) <hi>is perfect</hi> (and what can it doe? the next words tell us) <hi>converting or reſtoring the ſoule. The teſtimony of the Lord is ſure</hi> (and what can that doe? the next words tell us) <hi>making wiſe the ſimple. The ſtatutes of the Lord are right</hi> (and what can they doe? even that which is moſt ſweete where it is done) <hi>reioycing the heart: The comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Lord is pure</hi> (in it ſelfe, and it worketh gloriouſly in us) <hi>enlightning the eyes.</hi> I may ſay alſo, The word of the Lord is mighty, and it giveth ſtrength to thoſe who have no might. As it is mighty for the <hi>pulling downe of ſtrong holds, caſting downe imaginations, &amp; every thing that exalteth it ſelfe againſt the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt</hi> (2 Cor: 10.4, 5.) So it is as mighty for the rayſing up of the weake, for the lifting up of thoſe who are caſt downe and fallen below the knowledge of God through unbeliefe; and for the bringing of poore ſoules out of captivity into that bleſſed liberty of faith in Chriſt. What Great things the word rightly applyed, and divine truths brought home with Authority, have done and ſtill can doe was ſhewed at the 4<hi rend="sup">•h</hi> Chapter of that booke, verſe 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. As alſo at the 25<hi rend="sup">•h</hi> verſe of the ſixth Chapter, upon thoſe words, <hi>How forcible are right words?</hi> Though we ought to helpe thoſe who have no power by more then words, yet words have holpen many who had no power; as <hi>Job</hi> doth more then intimate while he reproves <hi>Bildad</hi> for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skillfull wording it with him. <hi>How haſt thou helped</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Some muſt heare that which they cannot beare (when that ſprings from their paſſion and impatience, eſpecially when from their love to and reſolvedneſſe to goe onne in ſinne; <hi>Amos</hi> muſt not forbeare to ſpeake, though <hi>Amaziah</hi> cry out, <hi>The Land is not able to beare all his words</hi>) But we muſt take heed of forcing words upon any which they cannot beare, or are not fit to heare, eyther by reaſon of their afflictions and temptations, or by reaſon of their preſent infirmities and incapacities. The Apoſtle (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15.) bids <hi>Timothy ſtudy to ſhew thy ſelfe approved unto God,</hi> (he doth not meane it in his private courſe of life and dayly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, which is the duty of every beleever) but in his publicke courſe of life, or converſe as a Miniſter of the Goſpel, in that,
<pb n="732" facs="tcp:153845:381"/> ſayth he, <hi>ſtudy to ſhew thy ſelfe approved (unto God) a workman that needeth not to be aſhamed,</hi> (what kind of workman was <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> his worke lay in the Word, ſhew thy ſelfe a workeman, and a Maſter in thy worke) <hi>rightly dividing the word of truth;</hi> how is the word to be divided? he doth not meane of a gramaticall, nor of a logicall diviſion (though there may be a uſe of theſe diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Word) but the dividing of the word intended by <hi>Paul,</hi> is the dividing of it ſpiritually to the ſeverall ſtates, and conditions of men, giving to ſuch, a word of inſtruction, to others a word of reproofe, to a third ſort words of comfort: This is <hi>dividing the word aright;</hi> And in doing this, <hi>Paul</hi> would have <hi>Timothy</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himfelfe <hi>a workman that he needed not be aſhamed.</hi> He would have him know to whom he uttered words: to know when he ſpake to ſinners, and when to Saints, when he ſpake to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and when to them that were in a comfortable eſtate; He would have him know when he ſpake to thoſe who were hardned in their ſin, and when to thoſe whoſe hearts were broken under the weight and ſence of ſin. And thus as every man who uttereth words, ſo Miniſters of the Goſpel eſpecially ſhould be well advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to whom they utter them. For as the ſame garment will not ſerve every body to weare, nor the ſame bed to lye upon, ſo the ſame word will not ſerve every ſoule. We muſt not doe as the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, who made one bed ſerve all his gueſts, and they that were too long for it were cut ſhorter, and they who were too ſhort were ſtretched longer. Yet thus doe they who have but one word for all commers, or for all they come to. We would judge him a very unskilfull Phyſitian, who, let the diſeaſe be what it will, ſhould preſcribe one and the ſame medicine, or apply the ſame ſalve (though a very ſoveraigne one) to every ſoare. As wee ſay, <hi>That which is one mans meate is another mans poyſon,</hi> ſo we may alſo ſay, <hi>That which is one mans medicine may be another mans poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> That which cures one diſeaſe may encreaſe another. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Phyſician muſt conſider to whom he gives the potion, as well as what he gives, and the Chirurgion muſt not onely know what his ſalve is, but to whom he applyes it, ſo in this caſe, <hi>To whom haſt thou uttered words?</hi> weigh it wel, whether they be babes or ſtrong men in Chriſt, whether they be under peaceable or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome diſpenſations, whether obſtinate, or tender-hearted; For theſe muſt be differently dealt with, as their ſtates doe differ.
<pb n="733" facs="tcp:153845:381"/> We may elſe doe more hurt then good. We may quickly (as the Prophet ſpeakes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.19.) <hi>Slay the ſoules that ſhould not dye</hi> (that is, grieve &amp; trouble the godly) <hi>and ſave the ſoules alive which ſhould not live,</hi> that is, harden and fatten the wicked in their ſinnes. The Apoſtle hath left us an excellent rule by his owne practice (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.19.) <hi>Though I be free from all men, yet have I made my ſelfe ſervant to all that I might gaine the more, and unto the Jewes I became as a Jew, that I might gaine the Jewes, to them that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, as under the Law, that I might gaine them that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, to them that are without the Law, as without Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not without law to God, but under the law to Chriſt, that I might gaine them that are without Law; to the weak became I as weak, that I might gaine the weak I am made all things to all men, that I might by all meanes ſave ſome, and this I do for the Goſpel ſake that I might be partaker thereof with you.</hi> In this context we ſee what was chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Apoſtles eye, (even that which is the higheſt and fayreſt marke in the world) <hi>the ſaving of ſoules.</hi> And that he might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine this end, he critically obſerved the temper and ſtate of his hearers, ſtriving to frame and ſute himſelfe, and his ſpeech accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; He was not the ſame to all, but he would be as they were to whom he ſpake, or with whom he did converſe; yet <hi>Paul</hi> did not ſymbolize with, nor connive at any in their ſins, he did not take upon him all colours, he was not a man for all men, or a man for all houres, and humours. The holy Apoſtle did not turne, as flatterers doe, with the times, nor faſhion himſelfe to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall garbes of men in a ſinfull way; <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo farre from any ſuch baſe complyances, that he having put the queſtion, <hi>doe I yet pleaſe men?</hi> anſwers and concludes in the next words (<hi>Gal.</hi> 1.10.) <hi>If I yet pleaſed men, I ſhould not be the ſervant of Chriſt.</hi> But weighing the ſtate of all men, he formed his words, and did accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate his Miniſtery for their gaine, or rather for the gaining of them. Some are all things to all men, that they may gaine by all, that they may advantage themſelves by all (which is a ſpirit not onely unworthy of a Miniſter, but of a man) but <hi>Paul</hi> complyed with all, that he might gaine them, or bring them in the greateſt gaine. Or he complyed with all men, that Chriſt might gaine, and faith in him be propagated, <hi>this I doe for the Goſpel ſake.</hi> I doe not this for my owne ſake, I doe not put my ſelfe into all formes towards men for my own preferment in the world, but that Chriſt
<pb n="734" facs="tcp:153845:382"/> may be preferred in the hearts and acceptations of all men with whom I have to doe, before the world. And that this was his purpoſe, we have his ſence fully from his owne pen (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.32, 33.) <hi>Give none offence, neyther to the Jewes, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church of God, even as I pleaſe all men in all things, not ſeeking mine own profit, but the profit of many that they may be ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are five things to be taken notice of, that we may utter words to profit.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The matter or what we ſpeake. Thoſe words which have no worth in themſelves can never profit others. While the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.2.) exhorteth the people to repentance, He ſayth, <hi>Take with you words,</hi> that is, choiſe words, ſelect words, conſider what words you take with you, <hi>when you turne to the Lord,</hi> and plead with him for mercy, <hi>ſaying, take away all iniquity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave us graciouſly.</hi> And as we are to take words with us, choyſe words to expreſſe choyſe matter in when we ſpeake to the Lord, ſo alſo in proportion when we ſpeake to Men, as from the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We muſt conſider to whom we are to utter words, we muſt not ſhoot at random, or without a marke; Some doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines are generall, but there ought to be a ſpeciall application of Generall doctrines. Other Doctrines are peculiar to ſome. We muſt not caſt pearles before ſwine, nor give childrens bread to doggs. And we muſt be as carefull, that we ſpeake not to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that is, to the truely Godly, as we ſhould doe to doggs and ſwine (for ſo the Scripture calls them) prophane and ungodly men.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We muſt conſider the ſeaſon or time when we ſpeake. Thoſe words will take at one time, which will not at another. There is as much care to be had, and as much skill ſeene in a due timeing of our words, as of our actions.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We muſt conſider the <hi>quantum,</hi> or the meaſure of words uttered, we may over-lay and over-charge thoſe to whom we ſpeake; Every one cannot beare a ſtrong ſhower of ſpeech, or words powred out like a flood upon ſuch. <hi>Our doctrine</hi> (as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayd his did, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.2.) muſt <hi>drop as the raine, our ſpeech muſt diſtill as the dew, as the ſmal raine upon the tender hearbe, and as the ſhowers upon the graſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, We muſt conſider the manner in which we utter words: whether to ſpeake as a <hi>Barnabas,</hi> or as a <hi>Boanarges,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="735" facs="tcp:153845:382"/> as a ſon of thunder, of wrath and judgement, or as a ſon of peace, of joy and conſolation. <hi>Of ſome have compaſſion</hi> (that is, deale tenderly with them, <hi>Jude</hi> v. 22.) <hi>making a difference, and others ſave with feare, pulling them out of the fire.</hi> We doe but caſt words into the ayre, unleſſe we thus make a difference in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeech, as they differ to whom we ſpeake. When we have duely weighed, the matter which, the perſons to whom, the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon when, the meaſure how much, and the manner in which we ought to ſpeake, then we are like to ſpeake to purpoſe, and ſhall be above this reproofe which <hi>Job</hi> here gives <hi>Bildad; To whom haſt thou uttered words?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>And whoſe ſpirit came from thee?</q>
                  <p>The word which we tranſlate <hi>ſpirit,</hi> ſignifyes alſo the <hi>breath; whoſe ſpirit or whoſe breath came from thee?</hi> The ſenſe is the ſame.</p>
                  <p>And.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some interpret <hi>Job</hi> thus; <hi>Whoſe ſpirit, or whoſe breath came from thee?</hi> That is, Conſider O <hi>Bildad,</hi> whoſe ſpirit moved thee, or who breathed theſe things into thee? whoſe breath or whoſe ſpirit came from thee when thou didſt utter theſe words? ſo 'tis a rebuke of <hi>Bildads</hi> preſumption, as if he had conceaved himſelfe wrought or acted by ſome extraordinary ſpirit, while he was ſpeaking, or that the things which he uttered had been dropt into him by an immediate Revelation from heaven; <hi>whoſe ſpirit came from thee?</hi> what breath, what gale hath filled thy ſayles? thou haſt high conceits of thy ſelfe, as if God had ſpoken to thee by his Spirit, or as if thou hadſt ſpoken theſe things to me from his mouth. But is it not rather thy owne ſpirit, thy owne heart which hath dictated theſe words unto thee? Some thinke the ſame ſpirit comes from them when they ſpeak, which came from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophets and Apoſtles, who yet are deceaved. The Diſciples of Chriſt thought the ſame ſpirit came from them, which came from <hi>Eliah</hi> when they ſaid (<hi>Luk.</hi> 9.54.) <hi>Lord, wilt thou that we command fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e to come downe from heaven, and conſume them as Elias did: But he turned and rebuked them, and ſayd, ye know not what manner of ſpirit ye are of:</hi> As if he had ſayd in the language of <hi>Job, ye know not whoſe ſpirit comes from you;</hi> ye would ſpeake the words of <hi>Elias,</hi> but ye have not the ſpirit of <hi>Elias;</hi> you have a zeale but not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to knowledge; yours is but a humane affection, not a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="736" facs="tcp:153845:383"/> inſpiration, as <hi>Elias</hi> his was, his was a pure ſpirit of zeale, but yours is a raſh ſpirit of revenge. And therefore your motion ſuites not with your calling; for as I am come, ſo I ſend you, <hi>to ſave not to deſtroy.</hi> We may ſpeake the ſame words, and doe the ſame things which others have done and ſpoken, and yet not with the ſame but with quite another ſpirit. Therefore examine, <hi>whoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit comes from you?</hi> This is a good and profitable ſence. Yet,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Cujus anima prodijt ex te; <hi>i. e.</hi> quem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolatus es tam efficaciter ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone tuo, ut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima ejus ex maerore quaſi in corpore ſepulta jacebat rurſum è latebris pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dierit ſeſeq, per corpus exſerue rit <hi>Piſc:</hi> Cujus animam verbis tuis vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vificaſti? He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braei, Apud <hi>Merc:</hi>
                     </note>Secondly, Rather thus; <hi>Whoſe ſpirit came from thee?</hi> that is, whoſe ſoule, or whoſe minde hath been recovered out of trouble and feare, out of ſadneſſe and ſorrow by the words which thou haſt ſpoken. Thus the ſpirit is taken for his to whom he ſpake, not for his ſpirit who ſpake, or not for the ſpirit with which he ſpake. This is a Great truth, gratious and right words, rightly applyed, doe as it were releive the ſpirit, and bring back the faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yea dead ſoule, from the grave of griefe and ſorrow, wherein it lay as buried. Now ſayth <hi>Job, whoſe ſpirit came from thee?</hi> Haſt thou recovered or rayſed any languiſhing ſoule by what thou haſt ſayd? who hath felt life and power coming from thee? I am ſure I have not, though I have heard thee out, and heard thee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively. What the Moraliſt ſayd of Idlenes, the ſame may we ſay of ſorrow or heavynes, <hi>It is the buriall of a man while he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</hi> And therefore he that hath comforted a man and recovered him out of his ſorrows, may be ſayd to give him a new life, and that the ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rit of ſuch a man is come forth from him: yea, he that inſtructeth the ignorant, and bringeth them to the ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, may be ſayd, to breath or put a ſoule into them. In which ſence ſome of the Jewiſh writers expound that place, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 12.5.) where it is ſayd, That <hi>Abraham tooke Sarah his wife, and Lot his Brothers ſon, and all their ſubſtance that they had gathered, and the ſoules that they had gotten in Charan,</hi> &amp;c. that is, all thoſe whom by good inſtruction and example they had gained to God, or (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.9.) had by their meanes <hi>turned to God from Idolls to ſerve the living and true God.</hi> Theſe ſoules they got in <hi>Charan;</hi> though <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> were barren of naturall iſſue, yet they had much ſpirituall iſſue, many ſoules or the ſoules of many came from them. And therefore when <hi>Job</hi> would put a diſparagement upon what <hi>Bildad</hi> had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, he puts him this Queſtion, <hi>Whoſe ſpirit or whoſe ſoule came forth from thee?</hi> or whom haſt thou <hi>reſouled,</hi> as the Greeke word
<pb n="737" facs="tcp:153845:383"/> which the Apoſtle uſeth for <hi>refreſhing,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> doth elegantly ſignifie (<hi>Acts</hi> 3.19.) <hi>Repent ye therefore and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out, when the time of refreſhing</hi> (or reſouling) <hi>ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord.</hi> When a man faints, or is very weary, we ſay he hath loſt his ſpirits, and he is even as a man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſoule. But when in the uſe of any meanes he is refreſhed, then we ſay, his ſpirit or ſoule is come to him againe. The ſpirit of man comes onely from God in its natural conſtitution, he is the <hi>father of Spirits</hi> (Eccl: 12.7. Heb. 12.9.) But the ſpirit of man may come from man in its refreſhings and conſolations. And therefore ſayth <hi>Job</hi> to <hi>Bildad, Whoſe ſpirit came from thee?</hi> or whom haſt thou comforted? Thou haſt undertaken to comfort me; but I am not comforted.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>Holy truths or words rightly applyed, have a releiving yea a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving power in them.</q>
                  <p>Such words give a man his ſoule againe, when he hath loſt it, and when he is (as it were) gone from himſelfe, he is brought backe to himſelfe againe. For as it is ſayd of the repenting Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall, <hi>he came to himſelfe,</hi> he was gone, he was loſt from himſelfe, his ſoule was departed from him, his underſtanding was none of his, he was no more Maſter of any ſpiritually rationall faculty, then a dead man is of any meere rationall faculty; and ſo his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reported him whilſt in that condition, <hi>this our ſonne was dead but is alive, he was loſt, but he is found</hi> (Luk. 15.32.) Now (I ſay) as it is in extreame ſinnings, ſo in extreame ſorrowings and deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of ſpirit, a man is loſt from himſelfe, he is as a dead man; and ſo when comfort comes in againe, life may be ſayd to come in againe; he who before was loſt is found, and he who was dead re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives. The word revives from a twofold death; It revives a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man from the death of ſin, and it revives a Godly man from a death in ſorrow. How many ſpirits have come forth at the voyce of the Word, out of the grave of ſin. Chriſt foretold this reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the ſoule by the preaching and publication of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel (<hi>Joh.</hi> 5.25.) <hi>The houre is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall heare the voyce of the ſon of God</hi> (in the miniſtery of the word) <hi>and they ſhall live.</hi> And leſt any ſhould thinke that this is meant of the reſurrection of the body, Chriſt ſpeakes of that diſtinctly
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:153845:384"/> (<hi>ver.</hi> 28.) <hi>Marvel not at this, for the houre is coming</hi> (he doth not ſay as before, <hi>and now is) in the which all that are in the Graves</hi> (dead bodyes) <hi>ſhall heare his voyce, and come forth, they that have done good, unto the reſurrection of life, and they that have done evill unto the reſurrection of damnation.</hi> As if Chriſt had ſayd, That powerfull voyce (and a voyce leſſe powerfull then that will not doe it) which is able to rayſe dead bodyes, bodyes mouldered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to duſt, from the earth, and cauſe them to live againe, (that voyce I ſay) is able to rayſe a dead ſoule from a ſtate of ſin to newnes of life. The Apoſtle ſaith as much, while he calleth the preaching of the Word <hi>a ſavour of life unto life in them that are ſaved</hi> (2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 2.16.) They ſmel and taſt life, even eternal life at the receaving of the Word. And as it is the meanes of conveighing life to thoſe who are dead in ſinne, ſo of recovering and renewing life to thoſe who are dead in ſorrow. <hi>Worldly ſorrow or the ſorrow of the world worketh death</hi> (2 Cor. 7.10.) and extreame ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſorrow, or the extreame ſorrow of the ſoule about ſpiritualls, puts us into a kinde of death. Thus <hi>Heman</hi> ſpake of himſelfe in that caſe (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 88.4, 5.) <hi>I am counted with them that goe downe into the pit; I am as a man that hath no ſtrength, free among the dead, like the ſlaine that lie in the grave, whom thou remembreſt no more; and they are cut off from thy hand.</hi> As <hi>Heman</hi> was counted among the dead by others, ſo he was like a dead man in his owne account too, as he ſpeakes at the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe; <hi>I am afflicted and ready to dye, from my youth up, while I ſuffer thy terrors I am diſtracted.</hi> He was not ready to dye of bodyly diſeaſes, but of ſoule terrours, nor could any thing revive him, or fetch him backe from that death, but the favour of God ſhining to him in the word of promiſe; how glorious is the word by the workings of the Spirit, which cauſeth the ſpirit to come forth, and maketh them who were <hi>free among the dead,</hi> become free among the living. This effect and fruit of the word <hi>Job</hi> expected from his friends before, and now from <hi>Bildad,</hi> but all in vaine; As their, ſo his diſcourſe with <hi>Job</hi> was fruitleſſe and ineffectuall. Much hath been ſpoken, but I have got nothing; I have got no ſpirit, no refreſhing, my heart is no whit cheared, nor my ſoule comforted, both you and the reſt of your brethren, have proved <hi>miſerable comforters to me. To whom haſt thou uttered words?</hi> I am no better, then if you had ſayd nothing. <hi>And whoſe ſpirit came from thee,</hi> not mine, for as yet, (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="739" facs="tcp:153845:384"/> all your reaſonings) my ſpirit is not returned to me; I am as deepe in ſorrow as ever I was.</p>
                  <p>There is yet another reading of this laſt clauſe of the verſe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Broughton, And whoſe ſoule admired thee.</hi> The ſame word may ſignifie to admire, and to come forth; becauſe the ſoule or ſpirit of a man comes forth (as it were) to gaze upon thoſe things and perſons which he admireth. As if <hi>Job</hi> had ſayd; <hi>Poſſibly O Bildad, thou preſumeſt that thou haſt ſpoken like an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Wiſdome, even much beyond the rate and proportion of ordinary men, or of what is common to man, and therefore doeſt expect to be applauded, yea to be admired. But whoſe ſoule is come forth by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thee? who hath admired thee? not I, nor doe I know, that any man hath reaſon ſo to doe, unleſſe it be, becauſe thou haſt ſo much miſtaken my meaning and intention in what I ſayd, and haſt ſayd things ſo improper to my condition. Some have the perſons of men in admiration, becauſe of advantage</hi> (Jude <hi>v.</hi> 16.) and others deſire no other advantage, but to be cryed up and had in admiration. I dare not ſay, that <hi>Bildad</hi> was a man of ſuch a ſpirit, though this tranſlation <hi>(whoſe ſoule admired thee?)</hi> ſeemes to charge him with ſuch a folly.</p>

               <p>IN the former part of this Chapter, <hi>Job</hi> reproved the laſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of <hi>Bildad</hi> as unprofitable, not that it was ſo in it ſelfe (for that was true and a great truth which he ſpake of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God) but the method which he uſed, and the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it to his caſe made it ſo. <hi>How haſt thou helped him that is without power?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In this Context, and the ſubſequent part of the Chapter, <hi>Job</hi> enters upon or reaſſumes the ſame argument or ſubject which <hi>Bildad</hi> had handled before; The power, ſoveraigntie, and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnes of God in his workes, both of Creation and providence all the world over. <hi>Job</hi> would let <hi>Bildad</hi> underſtand, that he was not unacquainted with the doctrine that he had preſt upon him in the former Chapter. As if he had ſayd, <hi>Doeſt thou thinke that I know not theſe things, ſurely I can tell thee as much, yea more of the power of God then thou haſt ſpoken, and thereby thou ſhalt ſee that I am not to learne, nor to ſeeke in this matter; yea I will point and paint out the power of God not onely in the viſible heavens, but in thoſe things which lye unſeene, I will goe downe to the deepes, to the bottome of the mighty waters, I can tell thee that he is not onely admirable above but beneath, in ſo much as nothing is bred or brought forth whether animate or inanimate in the vaſt Ocean, but it is by his power and at his diſpoſing. Yea I will goe as low as hell and ſearch the power of God there; I will alſo aſcend up to heaven, and ſpeake of the great things that God doth in the ayre, and in the clouds, and among the ſtarrs, whereby you may ſee that I am no ſtranger to ſuch divine Philoſophy, and therefore this was not the poynt you ſhould have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon, or that I needed to be informed in.</hi> That's the general ſcope and aime of <hi>Job</hi> in theſe words, I ſhall now touch upon the particulars.</p>

                     <hi>Jobs</hi> firſt inſtance concerning the power of God, is about things under the waters; <hi>Dead, liveleſſe, inanimate things</hi> are formed there; Properly that onely is a <hi>dead thing</hi> which hath ſometime lived, wee cannot ſay a ſtone is a dead thing, becauſe it never had any life, neither can wee ſay that water or earth are dead things, for they never had any life; but thoſe things that have had life, whether vegetative, or ſenſitive, or rationall, as man, or beaſts, or plants, when once that life is withdrawne from any of them, that is properly called a dead thing.

<pb n="742" facs="tcp:153845:386"/> their effects, not becauſe they are weake, but becauſe they weaken others. Giants are ſo ſtrong that the very ſight of them makes others weake and faint, or pulls downe men of ſtrength and might. It is ſayd that <hi>Saul</hi> and the whole Army of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were diſmayed when they ſaw <hi>Goliah,</hi> and greatly afraid; they were weake before the Giant. There is much labouring to make out this ſence of the word here; ſome underſtand it of the Giants before the flood; <hi>Behold, the Giants groane from under the flood.</hi> Thoſe Giants were indeed overthrowne by the waters; and ſo they conceave that <hi>Job</hi> alluded unto them, but I ſhall not ſtay upon that interpretation.</p>

                  <p>Againe, this word <hi>Rephaim</hi> is often put for the <hi>dead,</hi> or thoſe that are departed this life.

                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>That all things are produced in their beings by the power of God.</q>
                  <p>Dead things as well as living things, gold and ſilver, minerals and gemms are formed by God as well as men or beaſts. And as they were of God in Creation at the beginning, ſo there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall putting forth of the power of God in the continuing or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of them; God is dayly forming rich and rare things in the ſecret Cabinets of the earth, and <hi>from under the waters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>And the inhabitants thereof.</q>
                  <p>That is, as dead things are formed under the waters, ſo are the <hi>inhabitants thereof,</hi> or thoſe living things that dwell in the water; wee put in the Margin, <hi>with the inhabitants:</hi> who are they? The inhabitants of the water are the fiſhes, they are bred and abide in the water. As if he had ſayd, <hi>Thoſe precious ſtones and minerals, called dead things, are formed from under or in the waters as well as the fiſhes, who are the proper inhabitants of the water.</hi> Mr <hi>Brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> reades thus; <hi>Dead things are formed under the waters and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces neere them,</hi> that is, in the mountaines and hills, in the clifts and rocks are theſe precious things formed. But I rather take our reading, and ſo the Text gives a further illuſtration of the power of God; who as he formeth dead things under the waters, ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving things, or the inhabitants of the water.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>The power of God is great in forming the fiſhes of the Sea.</q>
                  <p>And the greatneſs of it will appeare if we conſider three things about them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Their number, as to us, the fiſh of the Sea are infinite in number, there is no ſort of creatures that multiply ſo faſt as fiſhes doe, therefore when God created the inhabitants of the water, we read (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.21.) how emphatically their encreaſe is expreſt; <hi>And God created great Whales, and every living creature that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, which the waters brought forth aboundantly after their kinde.</hi> The waters did not bring them forth by any power of their owne, but they were brought forth in the waters by that power which God had planted in the waters for that purpoſe. Now it is not
<pb n="745" facs="tcp:153845:387"/> onely ſayd that the waters brought them forth, but the waters brought them forth <hi>aboundantly,</hi> implying that fiſh doe multiply and bring forth more then other creatures; and therefore when the Spirit of God would ſhew a great increaſe of men, 'tis ſayd, <hi>They ſhall increaſe like fiſh</hi> (Gen. 48.16.) <hi>Jacob</hi> bleſſing the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> prayed thus;<note place="margin">Inter omnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtias nihil eſt foecundius piſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus igitur tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>f<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fertur ad mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicationem immenſum.</note> 
                     <hi>The Angel which redeemed mee from all evill, bleſſe the ladds and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers, Abraham, and Iſaac, and let them grow into a multitude in the midſt of the earth.</hi> The Originall is, <hi>Let them grow or multiply like fiſhes into a multitude in the midſt of the earth; or let them be as numerous upon the land as fiſhes are in the Sea.</hi> And we finde in the ſacred Hiſtory how the bleſſing and providence of God made good this hiſtory. For of the ſons of <hi>Joſeph, Manaſſeh</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> were numbred eighty five thouſand and two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men meete for warre (<hi>Numb:</hi> 26.34.37.) which exceeded the encreaſe of any one Tribe beſide. How wonderfully doth the Lords power appeare, not onely in thoſe infinite ſholes of leſſer fiſhes, but in the greater alſo? Who is able to report the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of theſe Sea-inhabitants, or of the fiſhes who people the Sea?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If wee conſider their various kindes, that alſo ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth the great power of God. Naturaliſts obſerve that there is no creature upon the earth, but hath (as I may ſay) its repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative in the Sea, beſides thoſe that have nothing like them on the earth; ſo various are their kindes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Many of theſe inhabitants of the waters are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the vaſtneſſe and greatneſſe of their bodyes; the greateſt of all living creatures are in the Sea (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.25.) <hi>So is this great and wide Sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable: both ſmall and great beaſts.</hi> The Pſalmiſt calleth the fiſhes beaſts, and there are ſmall beaſts in the Sea and great beaſts even of a ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious greatneſſe. The greateſt beaſts of the earth are as nothing compared to them; The Elephant is little to the Leviathan. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts have written much of this ſubject, the numerouſnes, vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, and vaſtnes of theſe water-Inhabitants. So that wee may ſee much of the Majeſty and power of God, as in theſe things that are formed under the waters, ſo in thoſe that are formed in the waters. <hi>Job</hi> deſcends lower yet in the next words.</p>

In this third ſence we may interpret it here (as I conceive) moſt ſuitably to the ſcope and purpoſe of <hi>Job</hi> in this place.</p>
                  <q>Hell is naked before him.</q>
                  <p>That is, it is fully diſcovered to him, he ſees who are there, and what is done there, he obſerves all paſſages there, even in that bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe pit of hel, as wel as in heaven or upon the earth. As if <hi>Job</hi> had ſayd to <hi>Bildad; You told me that God maketh peace in his high places, I tell you God hath to doe in hell, or in the loweſt places. The loweſt hell is naked before him.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaketh in this phraſe (<hi>Heb:</hi> 4.13.) <hi>Neither is there any creature that is not manifeſt in his ſight: but all things are naked, and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to doe.</hi> The words are an alluſion unto bodyes, which being ſtript, and uncloathed, all ſee what they are; there may be many deformities, blemiſhes, and ſcarrs, yea ulcers upon the body undiſcerned while 'tis cloathed or covered, but when na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked nothing is hid. <hi>All things are naked before God,</hi> that is, he as plainly diſcernes what they are, as wee diſcerne what a body is, that ſtands naked before us. Hell is called darkneſſe, and utter darkneſſe, yet it is light to God.</p>
                  <q>And deſtruction hath no covering.</q>
                  <p>Here the ſame thing is againe repeated, and 'tis uſuall in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſpeake that in negative words, which was before ſpoken in
<pb n="747" facs="tcp:153845:388"/> affirmative. As <hi>to be naked,</hi> and <hi>to have no covering,</hi> are the ſame; ſo <hi>hell</hi> and <hi>deſtruction</hi> are the ſame; and theſe two are often put together (<hi>Pro.</hi> 15.11.) <hi>Hell and deſtruction are before the Lord: how much more the hearts of the children of men?</hi> Though we know not where hel is, nor what is done there, though wee know not what is become of thoſe that are deſtroyed, nor what they ſuffer, yet God doth; and if the ſecrets of hel and devills are knowne to him, then much more the ſecrets of the hearts of the children of men. And as that proverb teacheth us that nothing is hid from God, becauſe hell and deſtruction are not, ſo another proverb de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the ſame forme, teacheth us, that nothing in the creature can ſatisfie the deſires and luſtings of man, even as hell and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction can never be ſatisfied (<hi>Prov.</hi> 27.20.) <hi>Hell and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction are never full: ſo the eyes of men are never ſatisfyed.</hi> The Devill who is the great executioner of the wrath of God, is expreſt by this word; as hell is called <hi>deſtruction</hi> in the abſtract, ſo the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill is called a <hi>deſtroyer</hi> in the concrete (<hi>Revel.</hi> 9.11.) <hi>And they had a King over them which is the Angel of the bottomleſſe pit</hi> (or hell) <hi>whoſe name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greeke tongue hath his name Apollyon;</hi> both the one and the other, the Hebrew and the Greeke ſignifie the ſame thing <hi>a deſtroyer;</hi> The Devill, who is the Jaylour of hell, is called a <hi>deſtroyer,</hi> as hell it ſelfe is called <hi>deſtruction</hi> from the Co-incidency of theſe two termes. Note.</p>
                  <q>Hell is deſtruction.</q>
                  <p>They that are once there, are loſt and loſt for ever. The reaſon why hell is called <hi>deſtruction,</hi> is becauſe they that are caſt to hell are undone to eternity. We read of a City (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.18.) which was called <hi>the City of deſtruction,</hi> becauſe it was to be utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; Hell may be called a City of deſtruction, not becauſe it ſhall ever be deſtroyed, but becauſe it ſhall ever be full of deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and nothing but deſtruction ſhall be there. There is no eſtate on earth ſo miſerable, but a man may be delivered out of it, but out of hell there is no deliverance. <hi>Heman</hi> ſaith (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.11.) <hi>Shall thy loving kindneſſe be declared in the grave? or thy faithfullneſſe in deſtruction?</hi> There grave and deſtruction are put together, much more may hell and deſtruction be put together, or for each other. What ever comes into the grave is deſtroyed, it rots and periſheth,
<pb n="748" facs="tcp:153845:389"/> much more doth hell deſtroy all that comes thither. And, looke as the grave is to the body now, a <hi>deſtroyer conſuming,</hi> ſo hell is to the ſoule now, and will be to ſoule and body after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, <hi>a deſtroyer tormenting.</hi> The loving kindneſſe of God ſhall not be declared in Hell, nor any faithfullneſſe of his in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, unleſſe it be his faithfullneſſe (according to what is threatned in the Word to deſtroy. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſayth, (1 <hi>Ep:</hi> 3.19, 20.) that <hi>Chriſt by the Spirit, went and preached to the Spirits in priſon, which ſometime were diſobedient, when once the long-ſuffering of God waited in the dayes of Noah,</hi> &amp;c. It is true, that Chriſt by the Spirit in the miniſtery of <hi>Noah,</hi> did preach to thoſe Spirits who were diſobedient in the time when <hi>Noah</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and were in priſon (or in hel) in the time when <hi>Peter</hi> wrote; But Chriſt did not preach by his Spirit in the miniſtery of <hi>Noah,</hi> or any other way to Spirits who were in priſon (or in hel) while he preached to them. There are no Sermons in hel, nor any ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there. The loving kindneſſe of God is aboundantly declared on earth, but it ſhall not be declared in hel; As there is nothing felt in hel but deſtruction, ſo there is no ſalvation offered to thoſe who are in hel. There's teares enow and mourning enough in hel, but there is not the leaſt <hi>Godly ſorrow in hel, which onely worketh repentance to ſalvation,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Auguſt: lib. <hi>21.</hi> de Civ: dei, cap: <hi>17.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>not to be repented of</hi> (2 Cor. 7.10.) One of the ancients hath reported the opinion of ſome in his time, who thought, that, though there be deſtruction in hel, yet not eternal deſtruction, but that ſinners ſhould be puniſhed, ſome a leſſe, others a longer time, and that at laſt all ſhall be freed; and yet (ſaith he) <hi>Origen</hi> was more mercifull in this poynt then theſe men; for he held that the Devill himſelfe ſhould be ſaved at laſt. Of this opinion I ſhall ſay no more in this place, then this one thing which he there ſayd; <hi>Theſe men will be found to erre by ſo much the more foulely &amp; againſt the right words of God ſo much the more perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by how much they ſeeme to themſelves to judge more mercifully.</hi> for indeed the juſtice of God in puniſhing ſinners is as much above the ſcale of mans thoughts, as his mercyes in pardoning them are; let not ſinners flatter themſelves in a hope of ſalvation when they are in hel, who have neglected ſalvation while they were on the earth. For as the Apoſtle ſaith (<hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3.) <hi>How ſhall we eſcape</hi> (that is, how ſhall we eſcape falling into hel) <hi>if we neglect ſo great ſalvation;</hi> ſo I may ſay, how ſhall any eſcape by getting out of
<pb n="749" facs="tcp:153845:389"/> hell, who neglect ſo great ſalvation. <hi>Hel is deſtruction,</hi> and as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe heaven is a place of happineſſe and ſalvation, therefore, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and happineſſe, heaven and ſalvation mutually or reciprocally ſignifie one another; to obtaine heaven is to obtaine ſalvation; to obtaine heaven is to obtaine happines: So becauſe hel is a place of miſery and deſtruction, therefore hel and miſery, hel and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction ſignifie the ſame thing, nor can they be ſeparated.</p>
                  <p>Againe, when he ſayth, <hi>Hell is naked before him, and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath no covering,</hi> we learne.</p>
                  <q>There is nothing hid from the eye or knowledge of God.</q>
                  <p>Philoſophy and reaſon teach us, that the vertue and force of the heavenly bodyes, the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, doe not onely act upon thoſe parts of the earth which are uppermoſt, but ſend their influences and powers to the loweſt parts or bowels of the earth, for (as was ſayd before) according to the ordinance of God, <hi>dead things are formed there.</hi> Now (I ſay) as the power of the heavenly bodyes reacheth downe into the earth, much more doth the power and light of God reach into hell it ſelfe. I will not ſtay upon any curious enquiries where this hell is; whereſoever it is, God ſeeth it. <hi>Hel is naked before him,</hi> therefore ſayth <hi>David</hi> (Pſal. 139.8.) <hi>If I aſcend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell: behold thou art there</hi> (that is, there thou art by thy power and inſpection, thou ſeeſt what is in hell (and if ſo, how much more doth God behold what is done heere upon the earth; if hell be naked before him, then the earth is naked before him; if deſtruction have no covering, then our actions heere have no covering: Hypocrites put many coverings upon their actions, they have many policies to vaile and ſcreene them from the eye of man; but the actions of men have no covering before God, yea the hearts of men have no covering before God; As <hi>Solomon</hi> in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> (which place was lately toucht upon) argues from this reaſon, becauſe <hi>hell and deſtruction are before him</hi> (Prov. 15.11.) <hi>Hell and deſtruction are before the Lord: how much more then; the hearts of the children of men.</hi> As if he had ſayd, God who look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into hell (which is not onely darkenes, but outer darkenes, that is, darkenes without any thing that hath the leaſt ray or ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of light in it, God (I ſay) who looketh into this hel) can looke into the hearts of men much more. There are ſome men
<pb n="750" facs="tcp:153845:390"/> (I grant) whoſe hearts are a very hell, a very deepe, and they hope to hide themſelves in the depth of their owne hearts from the ſight of God, as the Prophet telleth us (<hi>Iſai.</hi> 29.15.) <hi>Woe unto them that ſeeke deepe to hide their councell from the Lord; and their workes are in the darke, and they ſay, who ſeeth us? and who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us?</hi> And what doth he meane by the deeps which they ſeeke? doe they ſeeke caves and dens of the earth to take counſel or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult together in? no, they may be in the open ayre and yet ſeeke deepe to hide their counſells from God, ſo that the meaning is, they ſeeke to keepe their counſels cloſe lockt up in their hearts; but woe unto them that digge thus deepe to hide their counſells from God, for they cannot be hid, for even hel is before him, and deſtruction hath no covering, how then ſhall theſe deſtroyers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves or any of their counſels from him? As the reaſon of all things is naked and manifeſt before God, ſo are the motions and actions of all perſons.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When 'tis ſayd, <hi>Hell and deſtruction are before him:</hi> that word <hi>before,</hi> doth not onely imply that God hath a view or ſight of what is in hel, but alſo that hee hath power in and over hel, and can doe what he will there; <hi>hell is naked before him,</hi> that is, hee hath hell at his diſpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>The power and providence of God reaches to thoſe things that are moſt remote.</q>
                  <p>He orders all things in hell as well as upon the earth; his power rules there where there ſeemes to be leaſt order, yea where there is no order at all; They who are caſt into hel kept no order while they were upon the earth, nor are they in any willing order there; when we ſee confuſions in the world wee ſay, <hi>what a hell is there,</hi> or we ſay, <hi>Hel is broken looſe;</hi> hell is a place of confuſion, yet hell is before God, he keepes hell in order; And when by reaſon of troubles and confuſion among men, wee are ready to ſay, <hi>there is a hell in the world,</hi> yet this hell is naked before God, he diſpoſeth and orders thoſe places, perſons, and things, which are moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed; hell and deſtruction are before him.</p>
                  <p>Before I paſſe from theſe words, I ſhall onely take notice, that there are many words in Scripture by which hell is expreſt. The Rabbins number ſeven or eight, heere are two.</p>
                  <pb n="751" facs="tcp:153845:390"/>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Sheol</hi> or the grave, becauſe we lye as it were buried there in a ſecond death.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Abaddon</hi> or deſtruction, becauſe all are there in a periſhing ſtate, or as given up into the hand of deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Hel is called <hi>Tſalmaveth</hi> or the <hi>ſhadow of death;</hi> and by the <hi>ſhadow of death,</hi> is not meant a <hi>ſmal appearance of death:</hi> as the word <hi>ſhadow</hi> is uſed (<hi>Jam:</hi> 1.17.) where the Apoſtle exalts the glory of the Lord in his unchangeablenes, that he is the <hi>Father of lights, from whom every good gift, and every perfect gift cometh downe, with whom is no variableneſſe, neither ſhadow of turning;</hi> that is, he is not ſubject to any turning at all; but hel is called <hi>the ſhadow of death,</hi> as ſhadow is put for ſtrength and power, and ſo to be under the ſhadow of God or man, is to be under their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. Thus <hi>hell is the ſhadow of death,</hi> that is, the ſtrength and power of it; Death never triumphs ſo much in its ſtrength, as it doth in hell.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Hel is called <hi>Erets tachith,</hi> which ſignifyes, firſt, the <hi>earth under,</hi> or the loweſt and moſt inferiour earth, whence in Scripture hell is called <hi>the bottomleſſe pit,</hi> and the way to it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by deſcending and going downe: as heaven is deſcribed by aſcending and hight; heaven is high, and the higheſt aſcending is our aſcending to heaven: ſo hell is low, and the loweſt deſcending is deſcending into hel. Secondly, it imports, <hi>feare, vexation, and trembling;</hi> hell is a land of trembling, it is a land of feare; it is ſayd of <hi>Caine</hi> that when he went out of the preſence of God, after he had murthered his brother he went into the land of <hi>Nod,</hi> that is, into a land of trembling, which ſome expound not of any ſpeciall place that he went to, but that every place where he went was to him a land of trembling, hee having much feare and dread upon his conſcience after he had embrewed his hands in his brothers blood. Hel is indeed the land of <hi>Nod,</hi> a Trembling land; They who have not rejoyced with trembling in this world, ſhall ſorrow with trembling for ever in the world to come.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Hel is called <hi>Berſhiachathith,</hi> that is, <hi>the pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap> corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> not that the bodyes of the damned ſhall corrupt in hell (as they doe in the grave, for though we cannot ſay that the bodyes of the wicked ſhall <hi>be rayſed incorruptible,</hi> as the bodyes of the Saints ſhall, yet they ſhall be rayſed immortall, and in that ſence incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, that is, they ſhall never dye) but they ſhall be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible,
<pb n="752" facs="tcp:153845:391"/> that is, filthines and corruption ſhall be upon them: The bodyes of Saints onely ſhall be rayſed ſo incorruptible, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of corruption ſhall be ſeene upon them, or felt by them, but the bodyes of the wicked ſhall ever feele corruption, and beare the markes of it, without total corrupting, or periſhing, as corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and periſhing are taken for not-being. The wicked would be glad that they might periſh ſo, but they ſhall not, hel will be a pit of corruption to them, for whatſoever is painefull and grievous to the fleſh, ſhall dwell in their bodyes, and therefore it is called <hi>the pit of corruption;</hi> and it may alſo be called <hi>a pit of corruption</hi> in a morall ſence; becauſe all their ſins and luſts ſhall remaine upon them for ever; hel-fire cannot purge the ſoule from ſin, nor free any man from the power of that old man, who (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Eph:</hi> 4.22.) <hi>Is corrupt according to the deceitfull luſts.</hi> Nothing but the blood of Chriſt can purge the ſoule from corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>Hell is for the puniſhment of corruption, but not at all for the purging of it,</hi> and therefore it is well called, <hi>the pit of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, It is called <hi>Erets Neſciah,</hi> that is, <hi>the land of forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe;</hi> as the grave, ſo hell is called the <hi>land of forgetfulneſſe,</hi> where the wicked ſhall be remembred no more; God will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them no more, to doe them any good, and they are forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten how much ſoever they are remembred, who are not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred for good. And as God will not remember thoſe in hell for good, ſo they ſhall forget all the good they have had upon the earth; or the remembrance which they have of it, ſhall onely be to encreaſe their ſorrow under preſent evills. <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Parable (<hi>Luk.</hi> 16.25.) ſayd to the rich man in hel, <hi>Son remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that thou in thy life time receivedſt thy good things;</hi> and that remembrance of the good things which he once enjoyed was but an addition to all the evills and miſeries which he then endured. <hi>It is better never to have had any good thing, then onely to remember that we have had it.</hi> How miſerable is their condition who ſhall neither be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>membred for good, nor remember any good, but to make them more miſerable!</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Hel is called <hi>Erets choſcec,</hi> that is, <hi>a land of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, a region of darkneſſe;</hi> there is nothing but darkneſſe in hell: The wicked <hi>goe to the generation of their fathers, where they ſhall never ſee light</hi> (Pſal. 49.19.) They loved darkneſſe here rather
<pb n="753" facs="tcp:153845:391"/> then light, and they ſhall be puniſhed with darkenes hereafter, which hath no light. Darknes was their choyce in this life, and it ſhall be their curſe in the next.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, Hel is called <hi>Gehinon</hi> (whence the Greeke <hi>Gehenna</hi>) from the valley of <hi>Hinnon;</hi> in which the Idolatrous <hi>Iſraelites</hi> (imitating the abomination of the Heathens) were wont to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice their children with horrible cruelty. And hence the Scripture often makes uſe of that word to ſignifie the place of torment, or the torments of that place, where the damned muſt abide ſeparate for ever from the favourable preſence, and ſubjected under the wrath of God. <hi>This Hel is naked before God, and this deſtruction hath no covering.</hi>

Job</hi> alſo ſpeaks of the power of God in the creation and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of theſe things; <hi>He ſtretcheth out the North over the empty place.</hi> The word is ſo rendred to ſignifie a gracious act of God to regardleſſe men. (<hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24.) <hi>I have ſtretched out my hand, and no man regarded.</hi> God ſtretcheth out his hand to ſmite, and he ſtretcheth it out to ſave, but man layeth it not to heart.

                  <p>But why doth <hi>Job</hi> ſay, <hi>He ſtretcheth out the North?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, by the North he meaneth that part of heaven that is
<pb n="754" facs="tcp:153845:392"/> Northward, or the northerne heavens. Againe, the North may be taken for the whole heavens by a Synechdoche: and <hi>Job</hi> might ſpeak of the <hi>North</hi> becauſe the North-pole was neereſt the climate where he dwelt. <hi>He ſtretcheth out the North, or the northerne hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> that is, the whole heavens, both the North and South, Eaſt and Weſt.</p>
                  <q>Hee ſtretcheth out the North over the empty place.</q>
                  <p>What is this empty place?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By <hi>the empty place,</hi> ſome underſtand the moſt remote and uninhabited places of the earth: Hee over-ſpreads them with heavens, and diſpoſeth things there as well as here; hee ſpreads the heavens over thoſe parts where there is no man, and ſo may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, Empty places, becauſe un-inhabited, or not fill'd with men. <hi>God cauſeth it to raine on the earth, where no man is, on the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, where there is no man</hi> (as he ſpeaketh of himſelfe to <hi>Job</hi> in the 38<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now as God raineth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe (in this ſence) empty places, ſo he ſtretcheth out the heavens over theſe empty places, that is, he takes care of them as well as of thoſe that are peopled or inhabited.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Rather, by <hi>the empty place,</hi> wee are to underſtand the ayre, for in the natural diſpoſition or ſyſteame of the world, the earth is loweſt, the water next, the ayre is the third, and the fire fourth, over which God ſtretcheth out the heavens; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nothing is viſible to us upwards on this ſide heaven but the ayre, therefore it may wel be ſayd, that he ſtretcheth out the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens immediately over the ayre, or the empty place.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, I conceave that this phraſe may be expounded bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Creation; For <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayth (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1, 2.) <hi>In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning God created the heavens and the earth, and the earth was without forme and voyd or empty.</hi> It is the word <hi>Tohu</hi> uſed here in <hi>Job;</hi> over this <hi>Tohu</hi> or empty place did God at the firſt ſtretch the heavens. And as this was the worke of God at firſt in Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo it is his worke ſtill in providence; and therefore the Lord ſpeakes of it, as of a continued worke (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.24.) <hi>Thus ſayth the Lord thy redeemer</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that ſtretcheth forth the heavens alone, and ſpreadeth abroad the earth by my ſelfe.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, There is another Scripture that ſeemes to oppoſe this, and from which we may inferre, that ſurely the earth hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to ſuſtaine it (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.5.) <hi>Who layd the foundations of the earth, that it ſhould not be removed for ever.</hi> Wee put in the margin, <hi>Hee founded the earth upon her baſis,</hi> if the earth be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a baſis or pillar, then it doth not hang upon nothing. I anſwer, the foundation or baſis, in the <hi>Pſalme,</hi> doth not oppoſe the earths hanging upon nothing; for the foundation or baſis which upholdeth the earth, is not any created power without, or extrinſicall to the earth; God did not build the earth as wee doe houſes, firſt laying the foundation and then ſeting up the walls and roofe, there is no ſuch thing imaginable in the worke of God. But the foundation or baſis of the earth, is the infinite and inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power of God who made the earth. The will and word of the Builder is the pillar which ſuſtaineth this building. The thin ayre is all the appearing foundation of the earth. For as the heavens hang over the ayre, ſo the earth hangs in the midſt of the ayre. What then is the baſis and foundation of the earth?

<pb n="758" facs="tcp:153845:394"/> vaſt globe of earth and water, hangs as a ball in the ayre, and we ſcarce wonder at it. The Poets fained an <hi>Atlas</hi> to beare up the heavens with his ſhoulders; God is the <hi>Atlas</hi> that beares up the heavens and the earth too, the upper globe, and the under globe too; he made all things by himſelfe out of nothing, and he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports them by himſelfe upon nothing. We have an excellent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the power of God in this thing (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.12.) <hi>Who hath meaſured the waters in the hollow of his hand? and meted out heaven with the ſpan, and comprehended the duſt of the earth in a meaſure; and weighed the mountaines in ſcales, and the hills in a ballance.</hi> God made all things in weight and meaſure; and hee keepes the weight and meaſure of all things. As the earth was not till his word and will gave it a being, ſo his word and will alone is all-ſufficient to uphold it in that being. God hath not hanged the earth upon any thing but himſelfe, who is indeed infinitely more then all things. Take two or three deductions from this Grand Concluſion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The ſame power which made the world ſupports and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines it.</hi> Thus the Authour to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> ſets forth the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſt the Son of God (<hi>Chap:</hi> 1.2, 3.) <hi>Whom he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted heyre of all things, by whom alſo he made the worlds</hi> (both the naturall, civill, and ſpirituall worlds, with all the changes and ſucceſſions which have been in them) <hi>who is alſo the brightnes of the glory of God, and the expreſſe image of his perſon, upholding all things,</hi> (the naturall frame of the world as wel as the civill and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall frame of it) <hi>by the word of his power,</hi> or by his powerfull word, which as it once commanded all things into a being, ſo now it commands all things into that continuance of their being in which they are. Which power the Apoſtle attributes againe to Chriſt (<hi>Col.</hi> 1.17.) <hi>He is before all things, and by him all things conſiſt.</hi> Sin made the world ſhake; <hi>And had it not been for a ſecond creation, the firſt creation had been ruin'd and loſt.</hi> The earth and all our concernements who live upon the face of the earth, hang upon nothing but the will of God. If he let us goe we fall, though all the powers on earth would underprop and uphold us; and if he hold us up we ſtand faſt though we have no more of any earthly power to prop us up with, then the earth hath, which is propt up with and hangeth upon nothing.</p>
                  <pb n="759" facs="tcp:153845:394"/>
                  <p>Secondly.</p>
                  <q>God can doe the greateſt things without any viſible meanes.</q>
                  <p>This worke of God in hanging the earth as it doth, is to be numbred among the greateſt workes that ever he did; and thus it hangs without any the leaſt appearing meanes to hold it up. There are three arguments given in Scripture of the mighty power of God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That he workes by ſmall, even the ſmalleſt, meanes, wee have reaſon to wonder when effects exceed all viſible cauſes: as it ſhewes the great power of God when he ſtops great meanes from doing any thing; when he cauſeth men to labour in the very fire, that is, to toyle and ſweat themſelves to the utmoſt <hi>for very vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> that is, without any hoped for iſſue or advantage. Some labour in the fire for very vanity, becauſe all they get by their labours is worth nothing; but others may be ſayd to labour in the fire for very vanity, becauſe with all their labours they can get nothing. And <hi>this is of the Lord,</hi> this is an effect of the Lords power to make the power of man, in the uſe and improvement of the beſt and choyceſt meanes, ineffectual. So on the other ſide it is a great magnifying of the power of God, when by a litle power put forth by the hand of a weake inſtrument, he produceth great effects. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> brings it in with a behold (<hi>Chap.</hi> 3.5.) <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!</hi> When great matters are done by ſmall meanes, we have reaſon to extoll and cry up the power of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It argues the great power of God when he doth great things by meanes that are improbable, or that ſeeme no way ſutable to ſuch an end; as Chriſt cured blindneſſe with clay &amp; ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, which meanes had no ſutableneſſe to ſuch an end, the curing of blindneſſe; The meanes uſed to cure <hi>Naaman</hi> had no ſutableneſſe for ſuch a cure; and <hi>Naaman</hi> was ſo ſencible of it, that he was very angry with the Prophet about it, as if his leproſie could be cured by ſo ſlight a thing as that was; he thought he would have done it with ſome ceremony, or in an extraordinary way; yet this ſhewed that the cure was wrought by a divine power, becauſe it was wrought by ſo improbable an application<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As the power of God appeares in doing great things by ſmall meanes, ſo by doing great things by unlikely meanes.</p>
                  <pb n="760" facs="tcp:153845:395"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, It ſhews the power of God much more to doe great things without the uſe of any meanes at all. Such actings are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the Creation (<hi>Heb:</hi> 11.3.) <hi>Through faith wee underſtand that the worlds were framed by the word of God; ſo that things that are ſeene, were not made of things that doe appeare.</hi> Nothing appeared out of which this world was created. There was no pre-exciſtent matter, out of which the world was made; The world was made out of nothing; That Goodly fabrick of heaven and earth which is now ſeene, was made of that which was never ſeene; no man can tell what were the materialls of which God made the world. Now as God ſhewed his infinite power at firſt in making all things of that which did not appeare, ſo the great power of God doth appeare now in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great things without the appearance or external concurrence of any thing. The Lord turnes whole Nations ſometimes by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; things are done and no man can tell how they were done, or by what. We love to have a fayre Appearance of meanes, when we attempt great matters; But God loves to act when and where nothing appeares. We honour God moſt, when we are ſencible that the greateſt meanes is nothing without him; and that, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is enough when no meanes at all appeares to ſence. <hi>It is Gods uſuall way to doe things in a way which is not uſed; and ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to uſe no helpe or that which ſignifyeth nothing.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle deſcribes the dealing of God in bringing ſoules to himſelfe by a holy calling, and in removing whatſoever ſtandeth in the way of that call (1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 1.26.) <hi>For yee ſee your calling, brethren, how that not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble are called,</hi> &amp;c. (ſome wiſe and mighty men are called, leſt any thing in man ſhould ſeeme too hard for the Grace of God; and not many wiſe and mighty men are called, leſt any thing in man ſhould ſeeme to contribute to or helpe out the call of God) <hi>but God hath choſen fooliſh things to confound the wiſe: and God hath choſen the weake things of the world to confound the things which are mighty, and baſe things of the world, and things which are diſpiſed, hath God choſen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are;</hi> that is, thoſe things which are ſo fooliſh and weake and baſe and deſpiſed, they ſeeme to have no being, or are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as nothing, even theſe non-entityes, theſe poore tooles doth God chuſe and take up to doe great things by, and to nullifie or
<pb n="761" facs="tcp:153845:395"/> bring thoſe things to nought, which are all in all among or in the eſtimations of men. Therefore, ſo God owne the worke, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not much (I ſpeake not in regard of lawfullnes but likelynes, I ſay the matter is not much) what the meanes is; God can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wit wiſe men by fooles, he can over-power mighty men by thoſe who are weake. Thus God trivmphs over humane improbabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, yea impoſſibilityes, and would have no fleſh eyther deſpayre becauſe of the ſmalnes of meanes, or glory in his ſight, becauſe of the greatnes of it. How glorious was <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith in the former Chapter, who, was ſo farre from deſpayring that he, was ſtrong in faith, giving glory to God, though he ſaw nothing but death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the meanes which tended to attaine the bleſſing promiſed (<hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17, 18, 19.) <hi>As it is written, I have made thee a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of many Nations before him whom he beleeved, even God</hi> (who was it that <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeved? it was God. And under what no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did his faith eye God? even as he) <hi>who quickeneth the dead:</hi> when God is cloſed with under this notion, as quickning the dead, what can be too hard for faith? but there is more in it, <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith eyed God not onely as quickning the dead, but as he that <hi>calleth thoſe things which be not as though they were:</hi> that is, as he who maketh ſomething of nothing; when once <hi>Abraham</hi> had theſe apprehenſions of God, then nothing ſtucke with him, his faith could digeſt iron, and therefore (as it followeth) <hi>he againſt hope, beleeved in hope,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and being not weake in faith, he conſidered not his owne body being now dead</hi> (as to the procreation of children) <hi>when he was about an hundred yeares old, neyther yet the deadneſſe</hi> (as to conception) <hi>of Sarahs wombe. He ſtaggered not at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God through unbeliefe</hi> (that is, he never made any ſcruples or queries how the promiſe ſhould be accompliſhed) <hi>but was ſtrong in faith, giving glory to God,</hi> that is, gloryfying God by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving that he was able to make good the promiſe, or that it was as eaſie for God to create a performance, as to make the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Then <hi>feare not when God is a working, but he will cary on his worke;</hi> deficiencyes in the creature, are no ſtop to his actings: his immediate or ſole power is enough who hangeth the earth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no nothing. Where are the pillars that ſuſtaine this mighty maſſe? It hangeth faſt by no faſtning, but the order of God; And his order is ſtrong enough to hang the greateſt buſienes that ever was in the
<pb n="762" facs="tcp:153845:396"/> world upon. The <hi>Jewes</hi> have a ſaying, in reverence of the written word of God; <hi>That upon or at every Iota or the leaſt title of the Law, there hangeth a mountaine of ſence:</hi> and 'tis as true in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his doings as his ſayings: God can hang mountaines upon mole-hils, and turne mountaines into mole-hils for his peoples ſake and ſafety. It is rare that we are put to the actings of faith at ſo high a rate (There is uſually ſomewhat in ſight to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the actings of our faith and dependance upon God, they that are in the loweſt condition, have ſomewhat to looke to) but if there be nothing to be ſeene, then doe but remember, that <hi>God hangeth the earth upon nothing,</hi> and faith will ſay, <hi>I have all. Although the meale in the Barrell, and the oyle in the Cruſe ſhould fayle; Although the fig-tree ſhall not bloſſome, neyther ſhall there be fruit in the Vines; Although the labour of the Olive ſhall fayle, and the fields ſhall yeild no meate</hi> &amp;c. yet the Lord fayleth not, eyther in his power for us, or compaſſions towards us, and therefore the beleever can even then rejoyce in the Lord, and joy in the God of his ſalvation. <hi>For while there is nothing in appearance, there is not onely ſome thing, but all things are, that are for our good, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</hi> Faith may make all ſorts of comfortable Concluſions to and for it ſelfe (and not build Caſtles in the ayre) from this one Aſſertion, That, <hi>The earth hangeth in the ayre,</hi> or to give it in the words of the text, <hi>That God hangeth the earth upon nothing. The Conſtitution or ſyntaxe of Nature wel conſidered, is no ſmall advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to our hightning and ſtrengthning in grace.</hi>

                     </note> as Naturaliſts teach us, yet they are thicker then the common ayre, or they may be called <hi>thickned ayre,</hi> and therefore the Hebrew word for a cloud is derived from a roote that ſignifyeth <hi>Thicknes.</hi> And though we have a diſtinction of clouds into thicke and thinne comparing one with another, yet all clouds compared to the ayre are thicke, and compared to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters all are thinne; Beſides the Hebrew word ſignifyes clouds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently as wel thinne as thicke, or rather clouds Generally without any determination or reſtriction eyther to thick or thinne. And therefore the text is beſt tranſlated without an Epithete, <hi>In his clouds,</hi> or if any Epithete were given, It would advance <hi>Jobs</hi> ſcope and purpoſe moſt to tranſlate it, <hi>In his thinne clouds;</hi> for, the thinner the cloud is, the greater is the power of God, and the wonder the more wonderfull in making them the Continent of ſuch mighty waters. But, we tranſlate wel, <hi>Hee bindeth up the waters in his thicke clouds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may here be enquired, why the clouds are appropriated unto God in ſuch a ſpeciall manner, by calling them, <hi>His clouds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, the clouds are <hi>His,</hi> not onely</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In that common ſence (in which all things in the world are his) becauſe he maketh and diſpoſeth of them for that uſe, to hold the waters which the heate of the Sun exhaleth or draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up in vapours from the earth; But they are called his clouds</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe God is ſayd to uſe them as Princes doe Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of State or Charets of triumph to ride upon (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.1.) <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Lord rideth upon a ſwift cloud,</hi> as alſo becauſe, the Lord, to ſhew the unſearchablenes &amp; incomprehenſiblenes of his wayes and counſells in governing this world, and in ordering the affaires of his choſen people, is often expreſſed in Scripture as dwelling in
<pb n="765" facs="tcp:153845:397"/> a cloud, or covering himſelfe with clouds (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.11.) <hi>Hee made darkenes his ſecret place: his pavilion round about him, were darke waters, and thicke clouds of the skies.</hi> And againe, it is no ſooner ſayd (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.1.) <hi>The Lord reigneth,</hi> but in the very next verſe it is ſayd, <hi>Clouds and darkenes are round about him: righteouſnes and Judgement are the habitation of his throane;</hi> that is, his adminiſtrations are alwayes full of righteouſnes, though ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome full of clearenes, they are alwayes cloathed with equity, though uſually cloathed with obſcurity.

It is ſayd (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 78.13.) God rent <hi>or divided the Sea,</hi> that his people might paſſe through; And this word is uſed (1 <hi>Chron:</hi> 11.18.) concerning thoſe mighty men who fetched <hi>David</hi> water from the wel of <hi>Bethlem; And the three brake through the hoſt of the Philiſtines.</hi> And thus would the waters naturally breake through the clouds, but they are forbidden; The cloud is not rent under all that weight, for God holds it together, and makes it as firme as braſſe.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>It is an eminent a wonderfull act of divine power by which the waters are contained and ſtayed within the clouds.</q>
                  <p>The mighty power of God is ſeene in keeping the waters of the
<pb n="766" facs="tcp:153845:398"/> Sea in compaſſe by the ſands and ſhoares; but it is a greater act of power to keepe the waters of the ayre in compaſſe by the clouds. There are three things very wonderfull, or there are three wonders in this detention of the waters.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the waters which are a fluid body, and love to be continually flowing and diffuſing themſelves, ſhould yet be ſtopt and ſtayed together by a cloud, which is a thinner and ſo a more fluid body then the water. It is no great matter to ſee water kept in conduits of ſtone, or in veſſels of wood and braſſe, becauſe theſe are firme and ſolid bodyes, ſuch as the water cannot penetrate, nor force it ſelfe through; but in the Judgement of nature, how improbable is it that a thinne cloud ſhould beare ſuch a weight and power of waters, and yet not rent nor breake under them. When <hi>Peter</hi> had encloſed a multitude of Great fiſhes in his net, even an hundred fifty and three (<hi>Joh.</hi> 21.11.) we find this added, as a wonder, <hi>And for all there were ſo many, yet was not the net broken.</hi> How much more may this be added as a wonder, that ſuch a multitude of waters ſhould be held in a cloud, and yet the cloud not broken,<note place="margin">Hac ſane eſt ex illis naturae mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>bus, quae aſſiduitate vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuerunt.</note> yea though the cloud be toſſed and driven with feirce and raging windes. This is one of thoſe wonders in nature, which is therefore onely not wondered at becauſe it is ſo common; and, which becauſe it is continually done, few enquire into or admire the power by which it is done.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As it is a wonder that the cloud is not rent with the weight of the water, ſo that the cloud is rent at the ſpeciall order and command of God. At his word it is that the clouds are lockt up, and by his word they are opened As in ſpiritualls, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in naturalls,<note place="margin">Nulla gutta deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendit ex illis donec veniat verbum ejus &amp; mittat illas per plateas. <hi>Moſes Gerund:</hi>

                     <hi>He openeth and no man ſhutteth, he ſhutteth and no man openeth.</hi> It is not in the power of all the world to rent or open a cloud (though the earth be parcht and all things that live lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh) till God unlocke it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This alſo is wonderfull, that when at the word of God the cloud rents, yet the waters doe not guſh out like a violent flood all at once, which would quickly drowne the earth, as it did (<hi>Gen:</hi> 7.11.) <hi>When the windowes of heaven were opened;</hi> but the water deſcends in ſweete moderate ſhowers (as water through a Cullender, drop by drop and ſtreame by ſtreame) for the moyſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and refreſhing of the earth; And God caryeth the clouds up and downe the world (as the keeper of a Garden doth his water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="767" facs="tcp:153845:398"/> pot) and bids them diſtill upon this or that place, as himſelfe directeth. The clouds are compared to bottles in the 38<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this booke (<hi>v.</hi> 37th) theſe God ſtops or unſtops uſually as our need requireth, and ſometime as our ſin deſerveth. (<hi>Amos</hi> 4.7.) <hi>I have withholden the raine from you,</hi> and he can withhold it, till the heavens over us ſhall be as braſſe, and the earth under us as iron. <hi>I</hi> (ſayth the Lord of his vineyard, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.6.) <hi>will alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the clouds that they raine no raine upon it.</hi> The Reader may finde further diſcoveryes about this poynt at the 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Firſt, That we depend upon God not onely for grace, and pardon of ſinne, but for raine and fruitfull ſeaſons.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When we have raine, let us acknowledge that God hath rent the cloud and given it us; that he hath looſed the <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherein he had bound the waters</hi> (Pro. 30.4.) that they may iſſue downe upon us.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When the cloud rents not, let us goe to God to doe it. <hi>Are there any among the vanities of the Heathen that can cauſe raine?</hi> Surely there are none (<hi>Jer:</hi> 14.22.) And therefore the Prophet (<hi>Zech:</hi> 10.1.) ſends the people of God to him for it, <hi>Aske ye of the Lord raine in the time of the latter raine, ſo the Lord ſhall make bright clouds, and give them ſhowers of raine, to every one graſſe in the feild.</hi> Onely he who bindeth up the waters in his clouds, can unbinde the clouds and cauſe them to ſend out their waters. <hi>Job</hi> having thus ſhewed the power of God among the clouds and upper waters, riſeth yet higher in his diſcourſe, and from theſe waters wherein (as was toucht before) God layeth the beames of his chambers, he aſcendeth to the chambers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, even to the throane of God there.</p>

                  <p>To the firſt Querie, I anſwer. That according to Scripture,
<pb n="768" facs="tcp:153845:399"/> Heaven or that place above, in oppoſition to the earth, or this ſublunary world, is called the throne of God; and that not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior heaven, or ayre, (which in Scripture is more then once cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led heaven) but the ſupreame or higheſt heavens. Thus the Lord ſpeaketh by the Prophet (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 66.1.) <hi>The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footeſtrole, where is the houſe that ye build unto me,</hi> &amp;c. Thus alſo our Saviour in his admonition againſt ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (<hi>Math:</hi> 5.34.) ſaith, <hi>Sweare not at all,</hi> (that is raſhly) <hi>ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by heaven, for it is Gods throne, nor by the earth, for it is his footeſtoole.</hi> Againe (<hi>Mat:</hi> 23.22.) <hi>Hee that ſweareth by heaven, ſweareth by the throne of God.</hi> The reaſon why heaven is called the <hi>throne of God,</hi> is, becauſe there he manifeſts himſelfe, as Princes doe upon their thrones in greateſt glory and majeſty: as alſo becauſe there he is more fully enjoyed by glorifyed Saints and Angels. God fills heaven and earth with his preſence, yet he declares his preſence more in heaven then here upon the earth. Heaven is the throne of God, but</p>

                     </note>Secondly, What is the <hi>face of his Throne?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer; The face of a thing is taken for the whole outward appearance, or for the appearing ſtate of it. As the face of a mans body is not onely that fore-part of the head, which we ſtrictly call ſo, but the forme and ſtructure of the whole body is the face of it. And in that ſence the word is applyed both to thoſe great naturall bodyes, the Heaven and the earth, as alſo to a civill body, or to the Body-politicke of a Citie and Common-wealth. Thus whereas we render (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 24.1.) <hi>Behold, the Lord maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waſt, and turneth it upſide downe,</hi> &amp;c. The Hebrew is (and ſo our tranſlaters put it in the margin) <hi>he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth the face thereof;</hi> that is, he changeth the ſtate and outward forme of things, and putteth them into a new mould or model, reſpecting order and Government. And ſo we commonly ſpeake after great publicke changes, <hi>The very face of things</hi> is altered, <hi>or things have a new face.</hi> And thus the Pſalmiſt expreſſeth the gratious and favourable changes which God maketh in the things of this world (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.30.) <hi>Thou ſendeſt forth thy Spirit, they are created,</hi>

                     <hi>and thou reneweſt the face of the earth;</hi> that is, all things appeare in another hiew and faſhion then before. So then, <hi>the Face of the Throane of God,</hi> is that part of heaven (ſay ſome) which looketh towards us, or which we looke upon; All that
<pb n="769" facs="tcp:153845:399"/> Greatnes and beauty of heaven which our eye reacheth unto, and which appeares to us as a vaſt Canopy ſet with ſpangles or ſtuds of Gold, ſuch are the Starrs to our ſight. But I rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave. <hi>The face of the throne of God to be,</hi> the viſible and full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of that infinite light and glory wherein God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, and which appeareth or is given forth to the bleſſed Saints and Angels, who are ſayd to be about his throne according to their meaſure and capability of receaving it. The face of his throne, taken thus, he holdeth backe from us alwayes in this life, and as the face of his throne is taken in the other ſence, he often holds it backe from us. About which it remaines to be enquired</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, What is meant by <hi>holding backe the face of his throne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To <hi>hold backe,</hi> ſeemes to be the ſame, as to hide, cover,<note place="margin">Eſt tollere ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parentiam coeli. <hi>Cajet.</hi>
                     </note> or conceale the face of his throne; for when any thing is held backe, it is concealed and hidden out of ſight. Thus God doth often hold backe or cover the face of his throne (as the face of it notes the Appearances of heaven towards us) with clouds; as it is ſayd in the report made of that terrible ſtorme wherein <hi>Paul</hi> had almoſt ſuffered ſhipwracke (<hi>Acts</hi> 27.20.<note place="margin">Tenere faciem throni, eſt coelum occultare et ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducere nubibus.</note>) <hi>That neyther Sun nor Starrs in many dayes appeared;</hi> here was a holding backe or covering of the face of the throne of God. And thus our experiences have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten found it held backe; the face of heaven, being masked or vay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led over with naturall clouds and vapours. Againe, if we take the face of the throne of God, for that eminent manifeſtation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as in heaven. Thus alſo God holdeth backe the face of his throne, by covering it with a Metaphoricall cloud; as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.1, 2.) <hi>The Lord reigneth</hi> &amp;c. <hi>clouds and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe are round about him;</hi> that is, we can ſee no more of his glory in reigning, then we can ſee of a Kings throne which is covered with a Canopy, and compaſſed about with curtaines. <hi>Job</hi> gives this plainly for the interpretation of this former part of the verſe, in the latter part of it.</p>
                  <q>And ſpreadeth his cloud upon it.</q>
                  <p>That is, <hi>upon the face of his throne.</hi> Wee may take this cloud, firſt properly, thus God covers the heavens from the ſight of our eyes. Secondly, improperly, as clouds note onely ſecrecy and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy; Thus God ſpreadeth a cloud upon his throne, to hide it
<pb n="770" facs="tcp:153845:400"/> from the eye of our underſtanding; ſo that, we can no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the glory of God in himſelfe, or in his wayes and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings towards man, then we can ſee the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, when muffled and wrapt up in thicke clouds. Thus <hi>David</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the Lord (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.11.) <hi>He made darkenes his ſecret place: his pavilion round about him, were darke waters and thicke clouds of the skyes.</hi> But the Apoſtle ſaith (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16.) <hi>That God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in light,</hi> How then doth the Pſalmiſt ſay there and elſewhere that he made clouds and darknes his ſecret place and his pavilion? I anſwer; As the Lord <hi>is light and hath no darkenes at all in him (Joh:</hi> 1.5.) ſo, as to himſelfe, he ever dwelleth in light, and hath no clouds nor darkenes at all about him. And therefore when it is ſayd, that he ſpreadeth a cloud upon his throne, and maketh dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs his ſecret place, or his ſecret place darke, we are to underſtand it in reference to our ſelves; for whenſoever God hideth himſelfe, or the reaſon of his dealings and diſpenſations from us, Then the cloud is ſpread upon his Throne. When God is ſayd to ſpread a cloud over us, or any thing we have, it noteth his care over us, and his protection of us (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.5.) <hi>And the Lord will create up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every dwelling place of mount Zion, and upon her aſſemblyes a cloud and ſmoake by day, and the ſhining of a flaming fire by night</hi> (what is meant both by this cloud and flaming fire is clearely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the laſt words of the verſe) <hi>for upon all the glory ſhall be a defence (or a covering.)</hi> Thus, I ſay, a cloud ſpread by God upon us, implyeth that we are under his covert and defence. But when God ſpreadeth a cloud upon or covereth himſelfe with a cloud, this implyeth (all the Scripture over) the hiding and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing of himſelfe and his workes from us. And in this ſence <hi>Job</hi> ſayth; <hi>He holdeth backe the face of his throne, and ſpreadeth a cloud upon it.</hi>

                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>God manifeſteth himſelfe in heaven, as Princes upon their thrones;</hi> ſo heaven is the throne of God. And where God acts moſt, our affections ſhould be moſt, and our converſation moſt. Where the Throne is, thither the great reſort is, many flocke to the Court. As it will be our glory hereafter to be in heaven, or about the throne of God for ever in perſon, ſo it is our grace to be dayly there in Spirit while we are here. The earth is Gods footeſtoole, yet many make that their throne; Heaven is Gods throne, and many make that their footeſtoole; They tread and trample upon the things of heaven, while they ſet their hearts upon the things of the earth. 'Tis a ſad miſtake, when men ſet their feete where they ſhould ſet their hearts, and prophane the throne of God, not onely by levelling it with, but by laying it lower then the ground.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly; <hi>God hideth his owne glory from the ſight of man. He holdeth backe the face of his throne,</hi> he will not ſuffer the luſtre of it to appeare, but ſpreadeth a cloud upon it. Indeed we are not able to beare the cleare diſcoveryes of divine Glory (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16.) <hi>God dwelleth in light which no man can approach unto,</hi> though he were permitted and offered the priviledge to approach unto it. God dwelleth in and is poſſeſſed of that infinite perfection of light that no creature is capable of. When <hi>Moſes</hi> made that petition to God (<hi>Exod:</hi> 33.18.) <hi>I beſeech thee ſhew me thy glory.</hi> The Lord anſwered (<hi>v.</hi> 20.) <hi>Thou canſt not ſee my face, for no man ſhall ſee me and live.</hi> It ſeemes that while God ſpake with <hi>Moſes</hi> his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was overſhadowed, or that God (to uſe <hi>Jobs</hi> language in the text) <hi>held backe the face of his throne, and ſpread a cloud upon it;</hi> and therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> begg'd the removall of it, or that his glory might breake through it, and ſhine unto him; <hi>Wel,</hi> ſayth God, <hi>thou canſt not ſee my face;</hi> as if he had ſayd, <hi>If I ſhould grant thee that requeſt, thou art not able to enjoy it, or make uſe of it; for as my nature is altogether inviſible, ſo thou canſt not beare the ſuper-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling brightnes, which the cleare manifeſtations of my immediate preſence would dart forth upon thee; for that Glory of my preſence is too great a weight for humane fraylety to ſtand under; it would aſtoniſh rather then comfort thee, and in ſtead of refreſhing confound and make thee as a dead man. No man ſhall ſee my face and
<pb n="772" facs="tcp:153845:401"/> live.</hi> Man muſt dye before he can (in that ſence) ſee the face of God, and then he ſhall (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 13.12.) <hi>ſee face to face, and know as he is knowne.</hi> So that though we are much ſhort of the happines of the next life, while we ſee as through a glaſſe darkely, and God holdeth backe the face of his throne, yet it is a mercy to us while we are in this life that he doth ſo; becauſe we are not able to abide the ſight of him face to face, or to behold the face of his throne. As Chriſt had many things to ſay to his Deſciples, which they were not able then to beare; ſo Chriſt hath purchaſed ſuch mercyes and priviledges for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as they are not able to beare while they are on this ſide the grave. <hi>Every ſtate hath enjoyments ſuitable and proper to it.</hi> Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as God hideth his glory from man, becauſe he is not able to beare it all; ſo he hideth much of that from him which he is able to beare, both to make him hunger and thirſt the more after it, and to draw him into the greater reverence and eſtimation of it. We uſually eſteeme that more which is veyled and under a cloud, then that which is very cleare and openly revealed; and, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our preſent ſtate and frame, that is moſt reverenced by us, which is moſt concealed from us. When a cloud hath dwelt a while upon the Sunne we deſire the more to ſee the face of it, and are the more affected with the ſight of it. God will not hold backe the face of his throne from us in glory, nor will he ever ſpread a cloud upon it, and yet we ſhall have freſh deſires after it, and high valuations of it everlaſtingly; But while we dwel in this corrupt and corruptible fleſh, wee are apt to neglect that which is alwayes with us, eſpecially if it be alwayes alike with us. And therefore as the wiſe and gracious God, will not let us ſee his throne here at all in the full glory of it, becauſe we cannot beare it, ſo he will not let us ſee that glory of it continually, which we are able to beare, leſt we ſhould grow eyther careleſſe of it, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull for it. It is even beſt for us, that we have but a darke and imperfect ſight of God in this world, both in reference to what he is, and to what he doth: or firſt, in reference to himſelfe in his nature and Excellencyes. Secondly, in reference to his wayes or workes in their ſpeciall reaſons and ends. As our darkenes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at all comprehend the light of God, ſo God is pleaſed to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver much of his own light with darkenes that we ſhould not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it. How many glorious truths are there, the face of which
<pb n="773" facs="tcp:153845:401"/> he holdeth backe from many of his precious ſervants? how often doth he ſpread a cloud as upon the truths which he ſendeth in his Word, ſo upon the graces which he hath wrought in us by his Spirit? ſo that the ſoule is not onely hindred from beholding what is without, but what is within, and is ſo farre from beholding the glorious perfection of God and his workes abroad, that it cannot ſo much as diſcerne any of the gracious workes of God at home. <hi>He ſpreadeth his cloud upon it.</hi>

At the 8th verſe <hi>Job</hi> ſhewed how God compaſſeth the upper waters, the waters in the ayre, <hi>He bindeth up the waters in his thicke clouds.</hi> Here he ſheweth, how God by the ſame almighty power compaſſeth about the lower waters, the waters of the Sea. The Hebrew is, <hi>The face of the waters,</hi> as in the former verſe, <hi>The face of his throne.</hi> The face of the earth is the upper part of the earth (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.29.) <hi>I have given you every herbe bearing (or ſeeding) ſeed, which is upon the face of all the earth.</hi> And ſo <hi>the face of the waters,</hi> is the upper part of the waters, becauſe the upper part of the water, as alſo of the earth lyeth open to the eye as the face of a man doth. And it may therefore be ſayd that he compaſſeth the face of the waters, becauſe (though the whole body and bulke of the waters ſwel and rage, yet) the face or upper part of the waters is that which at any times breaketh over and overfloweth; And therefore the face of the waters, onely, as to us, is <hi>compaſſed about with bounds.</hi>

Neyther ſhoares nor ſands, neyther cliffs nor rockes are the bound and bridle of the Sea, but the Decree and command of God.</p>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is an unanſwerable argument of the glorious power and ſoveraignetie of God, that he is able to compaſſe the waters with bounds.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Who ſhut up the Sea with dores?</hi> (was Gods humbling Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Job</hi> in the 38<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of this booke, <hi>v.</hi> 8.10, 11.) <hi>and ſayd, hitherto ſhalt thou come and no further, &amp; here ſhall thy proud waves be ſtayed.</hi> The Pſalmiſt (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 104.) having ſhewed how at firſt (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1 1.) the whole earth was covered with the deep as with a garment,
<pb n="775" facs="tcp:153845:402"/> and that the waters ſtood above the mountaines, and were in the progreſſe of the worke of creation ſent downe by the valleyes into the place which God had appoynted for them, (having I ſay, made this excellent deſcription of the waters in creation, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes with the poynt of providence now in hand (<hi>v.</hi> 9.) <hi>Thou haſt ſet a bound, that they may not paſſe over: that they turne not againe to cover the earth.</hi> In which words the Pſalmiſt gives us three things clearely concerning the waters, Firſt, that once (he meanes it not of the deluge, but of the chaos) the waters did co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the whole earth, till God by a word of command ſent them into their proper channels, that the dry Land might appeare; ſecondly, that the waters have a natural propenſion to returne backe and cover the earth againe. Thirdly, that the onely reaſon why they doe not returne backe and cover the whole earth, is, becauſe God hath <hi>ſet a bound, that they cannot paſſe.</hi> They would be boundleſſe and know no limits, did not God bound and limit them. Wiſedome giveth us the like Elogium of the power of God in this (<hi>Pro:</hi> 8.29.) <hi>He gave to the Sea his decree, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhould not paſſe his commandement.</hi> What cannot he command, who ſendeth his commandement to the Sea and is obeyed? Some great Princes heated with rage and drunken with pride, have caſt ſhackles into the Sea as threatning it with impriſonment and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage if it would not be quiet, but the Sea would not be bound by them; They have alſo awarded ſo many ſtroakes to be given the Sea as a puniſhment of its contumacy and rebellion againſt eyther their commands or their deſignes. How ridiculouſly ambitious have they been, who would needs pretend to ſuch a Dominion? Many Princes have had great power at and upon the Sea, but there was never any Prince had any power over the Sea; That's a flower belonging to no Crowne, but the Crowne of heaven. There are two things which are more peculiarly under the command of God, firſt, the waves of the Sea, ſecondly, the heart of man. And becauſe God is able to rule the waves of the Sea, take two or three inferences from it; Thus,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That he is able to rule and command the heart of man; <hi>Solomon</hi> makes the paralel in this (<hi>Pro.</hi> 21.1.) <hi>The kings heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of waters: he turneth it whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſoever he will:</hi> And as he turneth both whether ſoever he will, ſo he ſtayeth both whereſoever he will. Moſt men at ſome times,
<pb n="776" facs="tcp:153845:403"/> ſome (wicked) <hi>men at all times are like the raging Sea when it canot reſt, whoſe waters caſt up mire and dirt</hi> (Iſa: 57.20.) who could live by theſe raging Seas, theſe raging waves of the Sea at once foaming out their owne ſhame, and threatning to ſwallow up others in deſtruction, did not God compaſſe them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with bounds? did not he ſay, here ſhall your proud waves be ſtayed; If God did not bound the ſea of ſome mens Spirits, they would not know much leſſe keepe any bounds; they would neyther know nor keepe, not onely the bounds of religion and piety, but not the bounds of reaſon and civility.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God is able to rule and put a bound to the rage of the multitude, who in Scripture are compared to Waters (<hi>Rev:</hi> 17.15.) <hi>The waters which thou ſaweſt, where the Whore ſitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and Nations, and tongues.</hi> And theſe are as apt to ſwel and be enraged with vaine paſſions and diſcontents, as the ſea is by windes and ſtormes (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.1.) <hi>Why doe the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then rage?</hi> rage as the ſea; and thus they will rage ſometimes though they know neyther why nor wherefore. (So againe <hi>Pſal.</hi> 93.3, 4.) <hi>The flooods have lifted up O Lord, the floods have lifted up their voyce: the floods lift up their waves;</hi> which as it is true li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally and properly, ſo it is as true (and ſo I conceave there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) figuratively and improperly or myſtically and ſpiritually, that is, peoples and nations like floods lift up their voyce, they lift up their waves as if they would overwhelme all; But what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth (<hi>v.</hi> 4.) <hi>The Lord on high is mightier then the noyſe of many waters, yea then the mighty waves of the Sea;</hi> that is, the Lord can quickly check and ſtop the rage of a people, when, or though they ſwel like a furious boyſterous Sea. And we finde <hi>David</hi> putting both theſe together by way of Expoſition (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.) where exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the power of God as he is <hi>the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afarre off upon the Sea</hi> (v. 5.) He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth (<hi>v.</hi> 6, 7.) <hi>Which by his ſtrength ſetteth faſt the mountaines; being girded with power. Which ſtilleth the noyſe of the Seas; the noyſe of their waves, and the tumult of the people. David</hi> joynes the noyſe and waves of the Seas, and the tumult of the people together; eyther implying, that he meant the tumult of the people, by the noyſe of the Sea; or that it is an act of the ſame power, to ſtill the tumult of the people, and the noyſe of the Sea.</p>
                  <pb n="777" facs="tcp:153845:403"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, God is able to ſtop thoſe ſeas of error, and give a bound to thoſe floods of falſe doctrine, which are ready to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow the face of the world. The Sea or Flood of the Arrian here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie (which denyed the Deity of Chriſt, or made him barely a Man by nature, onely cloathed with wonderfull powers and priviledges, this hereſie, I ſay, like a ſea or flood) had almoſt over-whelm'd the whole world; yet God compaſſed thoſe <hi>Blacke</hi> waters with bounds, and gave them a commandement which they could not paſſe: and though in this Age they ſeeme to returne, and ſtrive to over-flow the earth againe, yet both the waters of that hereſie and of all other damnable hereſies (as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> calls them 2 <hi>Ep:</hi> 2.1.) which abound in theſe dayes, and threaten us with a fearefull inundation, are compaſſed with bounds which they ſhall not exceed. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh of ſome in his time, (2 <hi>Tim</hi> 3.8, 9.) <hi>Who as Jannes and Jambres withſtood Moſes, ſo did they alſo reſiſt the truth; men of corrupt minds, reprobate</hi> (or as we put in the Margin, <hi>of no Judgement) concerning the truth. But they ſhall proceed no further;</hi> So the Apoſtle prophecyed of them; as if he had ſayd; They have a mind to proceed further, their will is to oppoſe truth and propagate error (in infinitum) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end; But they have now gone to the utmoſt of their line, they are come to their border, to their bound; <hi>they ſhall proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for their folly ſhall be made manifeſt unto all men, as theirs alſo was;</hi> that is, it ſhall appeare to all men that the doctrine which they ſtood up for, was nothing elſe but a bundle of folly, and that the doctrine which they withſtood was the truth and wiſedome of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Then, the Lord is able to ſtop and bound the floods, the ſeas of affliction, trouble, and perſecution, which are ready to ſwallow up his Church and people. The Church bleſſeth God for her deliverance from troubles, under this Allegorie of Waters (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 124.2, 3, 4, 5.) <hi>If it had not been the Lord, who was on our ſide, when men roſe up againſt us, they had ſwallowed us up quicke, when their wrath was kindled againſt us, then the waters had overwhelmed us, the ſtreame had gone over our ſoule, then the proud waters had gone over our ſoule:</hi> Waters, ſtreames, proud waters are nothing elſe but the perſecuting ſpirit and proceedings of ungodly enemyes. And why did not theſe lay all waſt? God would not ſuffer them. When <hi>the Serpent</hi> (Rev: 12.15, 16.)
<pb n="778" facs="tcp:153845:404"/> 
                     <hi>caſt out of his mouth waters as a flood after the woman</hi> (that is, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up many troubles) <hi>that he might cauſe her to be carryed away</hi> (that is, utterly ruin'd) <hi>of the flood. The earth helped the woman</hi> (ſaith the text) that is (as is conceaved) God made earthly men, by the uſe of earthly meanes, and for the attaining of earthly ends, as a bound to ſtop thoſe waters, or as a gulfe to ſwallow up thoſe waters which ſhould have ſwallowed up the Church. All theſe things doth he, and we may be fully aſſured he can doe all theſe things, and many more, <hi>who hath compaſſed the waters with bounds,</hi> yea we may be aſſured that he will continue to them, becauſe as he hath, ſo he will <hi>compaſſe the waters with bounds,</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill the day and night come to an end; <hi>or as our Marginal reading hath it,</hi> untill the end of light with darkenes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This laſt clauſe of the verſe is a proverbiall ſpeech, ſignifying perpetuity; or that ſuch a thing eyther ſhall not be at all, or ſhall be as long as the world laſteth.</p>
                  <p>But ſhall day and night, light and darkenes end when the world or this frame or conſtitution of things endeth? Will there not be day and light, or an eternal day of light in the heavenly Glory? is not that called, <hi>An inheritance among the Saints in light?</hi> Col. 1.12.) And will there not be night and darkenes, or an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal night of darkenes in helliſh miſery? is not that called outer darkenes? How then is it ſayd here <hi>that day and night ſhall come to an end?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer. Though after the end of this world there ſhall be both day and night, light and darkenes; yet there ſhall be no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitude of day and night, as there is in this preſent world, and as 'tis promiſed there ſhall be to the end of this world (<hi>Gen</hi> 8.22.) <hi>While the earth remaineth, ſeed-time and harveſt and cold and heate and ſummer and winter and day and night ſhall not ceaſe.</hi> Theſe are called the <hi>Ordinances of the day and of the night,</hi> and the ſtability of them is made the ſhadow of that ſtability of God to his gracious promiſe, that <hi>the ſeed of Iſrael ſhould not ceaſe from being a nation before him for ever</hi> (Jer. 31.35, 36.) In this world, light and darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes day and night are comming and going, departing and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continually; And in this ſence day and night ſhall come to an end, at the worlds end. <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes of day and night in courſe and ſucceſſion, not of day and night in being or conſtitution, when he
<pb n="779" facs="tcp:153845:404"/> ſayth, <hi>he hath compaſſed the waters with bounds, untill the day and night come to an end.</hi> The Hebrew ſtrictly tranſlated makes this reſolution of the doubt more cleare and doubtleſſe; for that doth not ſay abſolutely <hi>that day and night (light or darkenes) ſhall come to an end;</hi> but that there <hi>ſhall be an end of light with darkenes;</hi> that is, of the intercourſe or change between day and night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween light and darkenes;<note place="margin">Ad conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lucis cum tenebris. <hi>Jun:</hi>

                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Beyond this world there are no changes of times or ſeaſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the world to come all is day and light to the Godly, to thoſe who dye in the Lord; and all is night and darkenes to the wicked, to thoſe who dye out of the Lord. Heaven and hell, a ſtate of eternal Bleſſednes or wretchednes, have no changes in them, nor any thing that is Heterogeneall, or of another kinde. Heaven which hath light and joy in it, hath no darkenes, no ſorrow at all in it; Hell which hath darkenes and ſorrow in it, hath no light nor joy at all in it; The mixtures and changes of light and darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, of joy and ſorrow, of paine and pleaſure, are made here on earth. The wine of the wrath of God, and the wine of the love and conſolations of God ſhall be powred out without any the leaſt contrary tincture or mixture in the life which is to come. Light with darkenes ſhall no more be heard of; They who goe into light ſhall never ſee darkenes, and they who goe into darkenes ſhall never ſee light. Wee are now (as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes in the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of this Booke, <hi>v.</hi> 14.) <hi>Waiting all the dayes of our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted time untill our change come,</hi> and when that change is once fully come, we ſhall goe beyond all changes; <hi>Day with night will then be at an end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>What God doth he can alwayes doe.</q>
                  <p>As he hath hitherto compaſſed the waters with bounds, ſo he can compaſſe them with bounds untill the day and night come to an end. Men can doe that to day, which they are ſo farre from being able to doe untill the end of dayes, that, poſſibly they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe it the next day. The hand of man is continually ſhortning
<pb n="780" facs="tcp:153845:405"/> in regard of naturall ſtrength or activity, and it ſeldome keepes long at the ſame length in regard of civil ſtrength or Authority. As there are many things which man cannot nor ever could doe, ſo there are many things, which once a man could doe, but now he cannot. He is changed or the times are changed, eyther he hath not the ſame power in himſelfe, or the ſame powers are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued unto him. That man may be found ſhaking and trembling, who a while before (as it is ſayd of the Aſſyrian, <hi>Iſa:</hi> 14.16.) <hi>made the earth to tremble, and did ſhake kingdomes,</hi> inſomuch that all (as 'tis at the 10<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But the power of God knowes no abatings, nor his hand any ſhortnings, as he hath bounded both the natural and myſticall waters, ſo he can and will bound them and none ſhall hinder, untill the day and night come to an end. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſayth <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 29.10.) <hi>ſitteth upon the flood, yea the Lord ſitteth king for ever.</hi> As if he had ſayd, The Lord doth not onely ſit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (that is, rule and governe) the floods for a while, but he ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and governeth them alwayes, <hi>he ſitteth upon them king for ever; even untill day and night come to an end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly; note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The waters ſhall never totally overflow the earth;</hi> As God hath given them a bound, ſo ſuch a bound as ſhall keepe them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe for ever; And as we have an aſſurance in the power of God, that he can keepe or compaſſe the waters with bounds to the end of the world; ſo alſo we have his promiſe and his faithfullnes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged that he will maintaine thoſe bankes and bounds, and keepe them in ſuch repayre that the waters ſhall never prevaile over them (<hi>Gen.</hi> 9.8, 9, 10, 11.) <hi>And God ſpake unto Noah and to his ſons with him, ſaying, and I, behold, I eſtabliſh my Covenant with you, and with your ſeed after you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>neyther ſhall all fleſh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood, neyther ſhall there be any more a flood to deſtroy the earth.</hi> And as mankinde is under this promiſe of freedome from an univerſal deluge, ſo every godly man may
<pb n="781" facs="tcp:153845:405"/> riſe up to this aſſurance, that no waters of any ſort can wet ſo much as the ſole of his foote, or the hemme of his garment, but as they have leave and commiſſion from him, <hi>who hath compaſſed the waters with bonnds, untill the day and night come to an end.</hi>

                  <q>The pillars of heaven tremble.</q>
                  <p>There are various opinions about theſe pillars; firſt, many of the Latins hold, that theſe pillars of heaven are the Angells, by whoſe aſſiſtance (ſay ſome Philoſophers) the motions of the heavenly bodyes with their orbes or ſpheares are guided and maintained. And doubtleſſe as the Angels have great employments upon and
<pb n="782" facs="tcp:153845:406"/> about the earth, ſo alſo in and about the heavens, and therefore may (not improperly) be called the <hi>pillars of heaven;</hi> in which ſence alſo the Angels are called the powers of heaven, as ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret (<hi>Math:</hi> 24.29.) where Chriſt propheſieth, that <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly after the tribulation of thoſe dayes, the Sunne ſhall be darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the Moone ſhall not give her light, the ſtarrs ſhall fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven ſhall be ſhaken:</hi> Many of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients interpret thoſe <hi>powers of heaven</hi> by the Angels; as if the Lord would doe ſuch things in that great day, as ſhould trouble and aſtoniſh not onely men on earth, but the Angels in heaven, who may be called <hi>the pillars of heaven,</hi> as ſome eminent men for parts and power are called the pillars of the earth; And wee may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them pillars of heaven, not for the ſtrength and ſuſtainement of heaven,<note place="margin">Stabilita<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     </note> but for the beauty and ornament of it. As we ſee many pillars in ſtately Pallaces, which are not placed there to beare up the weight of thoſe buildings, but only to adorn &amp; beautifie them. Or Angels may be called the pillars of heaven, becauſe of the firmenes and ſtability of their owne nature, not as if they were any firmenes or eſtabliſhment unto heaven.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By theſe pillars of heaven are conceaved to be meant the high mountaines of the earth, which ſeeme to touch the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, according to ſence, and ſo to ſuſtaine and beare them up, as pillars; but this opinion not being grounded upon any truth in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but onely upon a popular errour, (though it be a truth that even theſe ſuppoſed pillars of heaven tremble at the reproofes of God) I ſhall not inſiſt at all upon this interpretalion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Theſe pillars of heaven ſay others are <hi>the ayre;</hi> for as the loweſt parts of the earth are called the foundations of the earth, becauſe the foundation of a building is layd loweſt, ſo the lower parts of heaven, the ayre (which is ſometimes called heaven, <hi>yea the firmament of heaven,</hi> Gen. 1.20.) may be called the pillar of heaven. 'Tis true alſo that the Lord maketh dreadfull combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions by ſtormes and tempeſts in the ayre, inſomuch that thoſe <hi>pillars of heaven tremble, and are aſtoniſhed at his reproofe.</hi> But I ſhall not give this neyther as <hi>Jobs</hi> meaning here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Terra tota velut orbis totius fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentum ac firmanentum. <hi>Merc:</hi>
                     </note>Fourthly, <hi>By the pillars of heaven,</hi> others underſtand (not the ayre or the mountains) but the whole body on globe of the earth. Thus <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.8.) <hi>Then the earth ſhooke, and trembled, the foundations of heaven moved and ſhooke, becauſe he was wroth;</hi>
                     <pb n="783" facs="tcp:153845:406"/> where the foundations of heaven in the latter part of the verſe, may be expounded by the earth in the former part of the verſe. For if we conſider the whole fabricke of the world together, then the earth ſeemes to be the foundation or pillar of heaven. And frequent experiences in all ages, eſpecially in ſome parts of the world, have felt and reported the trembling of the earth. We com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call it an <hi>Earth-quake;</hi> and Philoſophers teach us that the reaſon of it in nature is the ſtrength of vapours included in and ſtriving to make their way out of the bowels of the earth. And as this trembling of the earth hath a reaſon in nature, ſo it is often cauſed by ſpeciall command from God, as a reproofe of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnes of man, or to awaken him from his ſin; yet,</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, I rather conceive, that this phraſe, <hi>The pillars of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> is uſed onely in a generall ſenſe and not particularly intended eyther of Angels or mountains, of the ayre, or of the earth; but that <hi>the pillars of heaven,</hi> are the ſtrength of heaven: the ſtrength of a building conſiſts in the pillars that beare it up, take away the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and it falls downe, <hi>as Sampſon ſayd to the lad that held him by the hand, ſuffer me that I may feele the pillars whereupon the houſe ſtandeth,</hi> and when he had once moved them, the houſe fell (<hi>Judg.</hi> 16.26.30.) ſo that when <hi>Job</hi> ſayth, <hi>the pillars of heaven tremble,</hi> the meaning is, the greateſt ſtrength of or whatſoever is ſtrongeſt in heaven, the heavens themſelves with all their ſtrength,<note place="margin">Metaphorice haec dicuntur, non quod coelum columnas habeat quibus nitatur, ſed quod in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hementiori orbis concuſſione vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deatur nobis perindè ac ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutent ejus co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnae. <hi>Merc:</hi>

                     </note> tremble at the reproofes of God. So that this is onely a figurative and Rhetoricall expreſſion, not that the heaven hath any materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all pillars by which it is ſupported, but becauſe in thoſe mighty concuſſions which God cauſeth in the world, it is as if the pillars or powers of heaven it ſelfe were ſhaken and did
<q>Trembleth and were aſtoniſhed at the reproofe of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how may theſe pillars (whatſoever they are) be ſayd to tremble and be aſtoniſhed? I anſwer, 'tis thus expreſſed in alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to men who being ſeverely reproved, menaced, and threatned, tremble, and are aſtoniſhed. Here are two termes uſed; firſt, they <hi>tremble,</hi> which word ſignifyeth (as it were) the pounding and ſhattering of the heavens to peices, or as if they were even ground to powder, or crumbled to duſt. Secondly, <hi>They are aſtoniſhed;</hi> The original word imports not a light, ſudden, tranſient aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but an aſtoniſhment that ſtayeth, abideth, and taketh up the
<pb n="784" facs="tcp:153845:407"/> minde, or which draweth the minde to a deepe conſideration of the matter preſented, and thereupon to wonder and admiration. (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 29.9.) <hi>Stay your ſelves and wonder,</hi> that is, ſit downe and conſider this thing and wonder; barely to wonder is not enough, you muſt ſit downe, ſtay, and reſt your ſelves to wonder, you muſt take your fill of wonder at this thing. But how can the heavens be aſtoniſhed, which are not onely without underſtanding but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life? I grant, that to be aſtoniſhed is proper onely to rationall creatures, yet it is attributed to beaſts metaphorically, yea and to things inanimate or without life and ſenſe, as here, and <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.12. to the heavens; for as rejoycing is attributed to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and to the earth, to the mountaines, and to the valleys, all theſe are ſayd to rejoyce, to ſing; ſo alſo aſtoniſhment, feare and trembling are attributed to heaven and earth. And as liveleſſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ſayd to rejoyce, ſing, and praiſe God when men doe it, ſo likewiſe they are ſayd to tremble, when men tremble; when God doth ſuch things as affect men with aſtoniſhment, then alſo heaven and earth are ſpoken of as affected with aſtoniſhment.</p>

                        </gap>èr &amp; cum poteſtate.</note>Thirdly, What is meant by the <hi>reproofe of God,</hi> which cauſeth the pillars of heaven to <hi>ſhake and be aſtoniſhed.</hi> The word ſignifies, a ſore chiding, the ſevereſt reprehenſion, and that not a bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, but a reproofe with authority, and command, as a father or maſter reproveth his ſon or ſervant. Thus, when <hi>Joſeph</hi> told his dreame, <hi>That the Sunne, Moone, and eleven Starrs made obeyſance to him, Jacob his father rebuked him, and ſayd unto him, What is this dreame that thou haſt dreamed? ſhall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow downe our ſelves to thee to the earth?</hi> And when <hi>Joſhuah the high Prieſt ſtood before the Angel of the Lord and Satan at his right hand to reſiſt him</hi> (Zeph. 3.2.) <hi>The Lord ſaid to Satan, the Lord rebuke thee ô Satan, even the Lord that hath choſen Hieruſalem, rebuke thee.</hi> This rebuke had a threatening in it, and was ſpoken as with an angry countenance, in which there might be read diſpleaſure, and indignation. The vulgar tranſlates, not <hi>rebuke,</hi> but <hi>nod;</hi> The pillars of heaven tremble at thy <hi>nod;</hi> There is a reproofe in a nod,<note place="margin">Pavent ad nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ejus. <hi>Vulg:</hi> Sic illud poetae natu treme-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit Olympum.</note> as it was ſayd anciently, <hi>He made O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympus tremble with a nod of his head.</hi> A nod of the head may ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a reproofe as well as a word of the mouth. There is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold reproofe; firſt, verball or by words; ſecondly, reall or by action and geſture. A verball reproofe may be reall, but every
<pb n="785" facs="tcp:153845:407"/> reall reproofe is not verball. Both God and man can act reproofes as well as ſpeake them. And the word here uſed is applyed in Scripture not onely to verball, and voyce reproofes, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofes given by geſtures and by actions; for as the holy lives of Godly men who walke exactly are a reproofe to the world though they ſpeake not a word of reproofe, ſo the actings of God are reproofs, though he doth not ſpeake. Thus <hi>David</hi> ſayth, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.5.) <hi>Thou haſt rebuked the heathen, thou haſt deſtroyed the wicked;</hi> How did God rebuke the heathen? even by deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wicked; that act of thine hath been a reproofe to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and ſhewed them their folly. In the ſame ſence 'tis ſayd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.30.) <hi>Rebuke the company of ſpeare men, the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of bulls with the calves of the people, till every one ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with peices of ſilver.</hi> The rebuke there prayed for upon that boyſterous and bloody generation, was not a <hi>word</hi> but a <hi>worke</hi> of rebuke, that God would doe ſomewhat that might be a rebuke upon them, and a ſtop to them; as if he had ſayd, <hi>Seing this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of ſpeare men, and multitude of the buls will not heare any of thy words, ſeing they are not capable eyther of reproofe, or counſell, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rebuke them by ſome extraordinary hand, and viſible tokens of thy diſpleaſure</hi> (as it follows) <hi>ſcatter the people that delight in war.</hi> Thus ſome underſtand it here that God giveth a reproofe to the heavens, not by a word ſpoken, but by his providentiall actings and wonderfull workings in the world.</p>
                  <p>Further, this reproofe is expounded by that which is indeed the voyce of God (and ſo called in the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>Pſalme) the Thunder;</hi> which though it hath a naturall cauſe (for which reaſon Atheiſts laugh at the ſimplicity of thoſe who are led up to the thoughts of God, and to a reverentiall aw of his power at the hearing of it) yet that doth not at all hinder but that God doth in a ſpeciall manner diſpoſe of it (as he doth of all other naturall things) when he pleaſeth to ſerve his providence in the demonſtrations of his wrath among the children of men. To which end we may ſay that God doth often ſend forth his voyce from the clouds, and chides from heaven in thunder. <hi>The voyce</hi> (this reprooving voyce) <hi>of the Lord is upon the waters</hi> (that is, upon the waters which are above the firmament) <hi>the God of glory thundereth, the Lord is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many waters, the voyce of the Lord is powerfull, the voyce of the Lord is full of majeſty, the voyce of the Lord breaketh the Cedars,
<pb n="786" facs="tcp:153845:408"/> hee breaketh the Cedars of Lebanon, the voyce of the Lord divideth the flames of fire, the voyce of the Lord ſhaketh the Wildernes, the Lord ſhaketh the Wildernes of Kades,</hi> &amp;c. Thus the pillars of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, proper, and the pillars of heaven, in a figure, tremble at or are aſtoniſhed at theſe loud reproofes.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <q>The greateſt ſtrength of the creature trembleth at the angry diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations and appearances of God.</q>
                  <p>As the lifting up of the light of Gods countenance, puts joy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart more then corn &amp; wine, the beſt things of this world, ſo the darkenes of Gods countenance puts more trouble and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row into our hearts, then gall and wormewood, the worſt of the world can doe. <hi>David</hi> deſcribes at large in what a kinde of hudle and hurry the world was in ſuch a day (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.13, 14, 15.) <hi>Then the earth ſhooke and trembled, the foundations alſo of the hils moved and were ſhaken becauſe he was wroth. The Lord alſo thundered in the heavens, and the higheſt gave his voyce, haileſtones and coales of fire, he ſent out his arrows and ſcattered them, and he ſhot out light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and diſcomfited them, then the channels of waters were ſeene, and the foundations of the world were diſcovered at thy rebuke O Lord, at the blaſt of the breath of thy noſtrills.</hi> What <hi>David</hi> there ſpake of thunder, and lightning, and hayle-ſtones, hath been vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly effected for the deſtruction of the enemyes of the people of God, and for the deliverance of his children. The hiſtory of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhuah</hi> gives us a famous inſtance at the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter; and though it be not recorded that <hi>David</hi> obtained victoryes by ſuch imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate helpes from heaven, yet it is not improbable (conſidering the tenour of this Pſalme) that he did. And we have a notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a victory obtained by Thunder and lightning in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Church, whence that Chriſtian Legion of Souldiers who had earneſtly prayed that God would appeare for their help, was called <hi>The Thundering Legion.</hi> But whether we expound this context in the Pſalme literally and ſtrictly, as expreſſing what God did for <hi>David</hi> in this kinde; Or figuratively, as expreſſing onely thus much, that God did wonderfull things, in one kinde or other, in helping <hi>David</hi> againſt his enemyes, or whether we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it myſtically, of what God doth to and for the ſoules and ſpirituall eſtates of men, yet it holds forth in all the utter inability
<pb n="787" facs="tcp:153845:408"/> of man to beare up when the Lord ſhewes himſelfe in any ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible demonſtrations of his preſence. Againe (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.32.) <hi>He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth, he toucheth the hills, and they ſmoake.</hi> There is a twofold looke of God; Firſt, there is the looke of Gods favour, and thus Saints often pray that God will looke downe from heaven upon them; this looke is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiving, yea the reviving of the ſoule; ſecondly, there is a looke of diſpleaſure, an angry, a frowning looke, when clouds and ſtormes are ſeene in the brow: Thus in the Pſalme God is ſayd to <hi>looke on the earth</hi> frowningly, childingly, and then it trembled, <hi>he toucheth the hills, and they ſmoak,</hi> that is, they are as all on-fire; The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural hils ſmoake at Gods touch, and ſo doe the metaphoricall hills; when God toucheth the great men of the earth they ſmoake, preſently they fret and fume, till they breake out into a flame of rage, heating and vexing both themſelves and all that are neere them. (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 50.2.) <hi>Behold, at my rebuke I dry up</hi> (or I can dry up) <hi>the Sea,</hi> I am as able to doe it now with a word of my mouth, as I once did it for the deliverance of your forefathers, (<hi>Exo:</hi> 14.21.29.) <hi>I make</hi> (or I can make when I will with my rebuke) <hi>the rivers a wilderneſſe</hi> (that is, as dry as a deſert or wildernes u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to be) <hi>their fiſh ſtinketh, becauſe there is no water, and dyeth for thirſt.</hi> What ſtrange worke doth the rebuke of God make? By that he drieth the ſea, by that he maketh the river a wildernes: and as he doth this by the power of his reproofes upon the ſea and rivers natural, ſo upon the ſea and rivers myſticall. He can dry up thoſe worldly helpes which ſeeme as inexhauſtible as the ſea, and as laſting and conſtant to us as a river which is fed with a continuall ſpring. And when any power riſeth up againſt us as deepe and dangerous as the ſea, as wel ſupplyed and ſeconded as a river, yet we need not feare for God can preſently dry it up, and make us a paſſage over it, or through it. Yea they who are as well bottom'd and foundation'd as the earth, ſhall quickly feele the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his power (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 114.7.) <hi>Tremble thou earth at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord: at the preſence of the God of Jacob.</hi> But ſome may ſay, if the earth trembleth at the preſence of God, then the earth muſt alwayes tremble, for God is alwayes preſent; or what is the preſence of God there ſpoken of? I anſwer, as there is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, that maketh all thoſe that enjoy it to ſing for joy; <hi>In thy preſence is fullneſſe of joy, and at thy right hand are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="788" facs="tcp:153845:409"/> for evermore</hi> (Pſal. 16.11.) ſo there is a preſence of God that is very terrible to the creature; yea that preſence of God which is comfortable to his people is terrible to his enemyes; for when the Pſalmiſt had ſayd (<hi>ver.</hi> 2.) <hi>Judah was his Sanctuary, and Iſrael his dominion;</hi> that is, a people ſanctifyed to him, and governed and protected by him; preſently it followeth; <hi>The ſea ſaw it and fled, Jordan was driven backe; The mountaines skipped like rams, and the litle hils like lambs.</hi> The Pſalmiſt perceaving all things in ſuch a trembling fit and confuſion, ſeemes to wonder what the matter was, and therefore puts the queſtion, <hi>What ayled thee, O thou ſea, that thou fleddeſt, yea mountaines that ye skipped, &amp;c?</hi> And preſently maketh anſwer, <hi>Tremble thou earth at the preſence of the Lord;</hi> As if he had ſayd, the cauſe of all this terrour and trouble among the creatures, was nothing elſe but the preſence of God. And if the very ſence-leſſe creatures were ſencible of his wrathfull preſence, how much more muſt man both be ſencible of it, and ſtoop unto it. This the Lord inſinuates by a cutting queſtion (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.14.) <hi>Can thy heart indure, or can thy hands be ſtrong in the day that I ſhall deale with thee, I the Lord have ſpoken it, and will doe it.</hi> The Lord by his Prophet ſpeakes there to a people that had a double ſtrength; they were <hi>ſtrong hearted,</hi> and they were <hi>ſtrong handed,</hi> they had much force or outward power, and they had much courage or inward power; but neyther hand-ſtrength, nor heart-ſtrength, neyther force nor courage ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayle you <hi>in that day</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>that I ſhall deale with you</hi> after the dealings of an enemy in wrath and Judgement. God ſtrengthens the hands of his ſervants and encourageth their hearts to endure his ſevereſt dealings with them. But when he commeth to deale ſeverely with thoſe who are rebellious and wicked, their hearts who are ſtouteſt among them ſhall not be able to endure, nor can they ſtrengthen their hands. <hi>They who have ſtrengthned their hearts and hands moſt to commit ſin, ſhall be leaſt able to ſtrengthen them for the bearing of the puniſhment of ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hence by way of Coralary or inference conſider.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If the pillars of heaven tremble before God, if pillars (whoſe nature is to ſtand ſtill) move at the preſence of God, what ſhall become of weake man, of man who is a worme? if the pillars of heaven tremble at the reproofe of God, then certainly the pillars of the earth cannot ſtand faſt at his reproofe. The pillars
<pb n="789" facs="tcp:153845:409"/> of heaven are the ſtro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>geſt pillars. When <hi>Jehu</hi> ſent Letters to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria</hi> unto the rulers of <hi>Jezreel,</hi> adviſing them to ſet up one of the Sons of <hi>Ahab</hi> King and fight for him, the text ſaith (2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.4.) <hi>they were exceedingly affrayd, and ſayd, Behold two Kings ſtood not before him, how then can we ſtand?</hi> And thus may the ſtrongeſt pillars on earth cry out with feare at the diſpleaſure and reproofes of God, Behold the pillars of heaven tremble and are aſtoniſhed at his reproofes, how then can we be eſtabliſhed? Some men are or are eſteemed to be like <hi>James, Cephas,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> pillars in the Church (<hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9.) and others are pillars in States and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths; So we may expound that of <hi>Hannah</hi> in her ſong (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.8.) <hi>The pillars of the earth</hi> (that is, earthly powers or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates) <hi>are the Lords, and he hath ſet the world upon them,</hi> for, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the world would ſoone fall into confuſion, and ſhatter to peices (as to its civil capacity) if the Lord had hot founded it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pillars of Government and Magiſtracy, or ſet up Magiſtrates and Governours as the pillars of it. And yet how often have theſe pillars of the earth trembled? how many of them have fallen and been broken at the rebukes of God? There is a ſort of pillars that ſhall never be moved; How great an honour is it to be made ſuch a pillar, and Chriſt hath taught us who ſhall be made ſuch a one (<hi>Rev:</hi> 3.12.) <hi>Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the Temple of my God;</hi> Such pillars ſhall not tremble, they ſhall not be aſtoniſhed, when all the pillars of the world are caſt downe with trembling and aſtoniſhment. <hi>David</hi> hath a ſtrange expreſſion (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.3.) <hi>The earth and all the inhabitants of it are diſſolved,</hi> (if ſo, whence was it that they were not utterly ruin'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; He anſwers) <hi>I beare up the pillars of it.</hi> But how could <hi>David</hi> beare up the pillars of the earth, when all was diſſolved? he meanes it not of a natural but civill diſſolution; things were out of order, the bands and ligaments of government were ſorely bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, men were divided into partyes and factions. Thus the earth, and inhabitants thereof were diſſolved, which is the ſaddeſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a people can be in; when it was thus, when there was ſuch a rupture among the people, Then <hi>David</hi> the chiefe Governour (under God) laboured to heale the breaches, and to be a pillar to thoſe ſhaking pillars; He by his great wiſedome, Juſtice, modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and faithfullneſſe, bore up the bearers of the people, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported their ſupporters, whether perſons or things; As if he had
<pb n="790" facs="tcp:153845:410"/> ſayd, though there be much confuſion in the earth, yet the Lord enables me to keepe things together, ſo that they fall not to the ground, and are not utterly ruined. <hi>It is a Great honour to be a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar bearing up the building, but it is a greater honour to be a pillar bearing up the pillars;</hi> All good Magiſtrates have the former ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and all ſupreame Magiſtrates, if good, have the latter; yet both theſe honours doe originally &amp; primarily belong unto God; who as he maketh the pillars of heaven tremble, ſo he can firmely ſetle (and will while they willingly ſerve his ends and intereſts) the pillars of the Earth, though but earthly pillars.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Take this alſo by way of Corrolary from the text; <hi>If the pillars of heaven tremble, and are aſtoniſhed at the reproofe of God;</hi> what ſhall we ſay of thoſe men, or of the hardneſſe of their hearts?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Who, <hi>heare the reproofes of God dayly, yet tremble not.</hi> What? doe the pillars of heaven tremble at the reproofe of God, and ſhall not men! yet, thus more then bruitiſh are many men; They heare reproofes, ſevere reproofes againſt ſin, yet they trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble no more then the ſtones they ſtand upon, nor are moved any more then the ſeates they ſit upon; let God thunder, and lighten, and chide, and threaten, they are not ſtirred with it; The pillars of heaven ſhall riſe up in judgement againſt this dedolent and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate generation. The Prophet (<hi>Jere:</hi> 36.24.) reports a ſad ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this; a threatening rolle was ſent to <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> king of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> written from the mouth of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> by <hi>Barucke;</hi> the King cauſed it to be read as he ſate at the fire, and then (whereas it might have been expected that he ſhould be cut at the heart with Godly ſorrow and contrition for his ſin) <hi>he cut it with the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knife and caſt it into the fire that was on the hearth untill all the roll was conſumed in the fire that was on the hearth; yet they were not afraid nor rent their garments, neither the king, or any of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that heard all theſe words;</hi> as if it had bin ſayd, what a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull hardneſſe was there upon the hearts of theſe men, that they could heare ſuch words read, words ſo full of terrour, words cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with ſuch reproofes, words which ſpake nothing but death, wrath, deſtruction, ruine, and deſolation, yet notwithſtanding all this they were not afraid, neither the King nor any of his ſervants regarded it. <hi>The heart of man is more hard then hardneſſe it ſelfe, till God ſoften it, or breaketh it;</hi> man moves not, he relents not,
<pb n="791" facs="tcp:153845:410"/> let God reprove, and thunder, let God doe what he will and ſay what he will, let God make (as it were) a hell upon the earth, and, in the greateſt earneſt, caſt abroad his firebrands, arrows, and death, in the dreadfulleſt repreſentations of wrath and judgement, yet man trembles not, nor is he any more aſtoniſhed then if all this were ſpoken in jeſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What ſhall we ſay of thoſe who as they tremble not when they heare the reproofes of God, ſo they tremble not when they ſee his reproofes. When God makes his reproofes viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and writes them in blood; when he brings forth his reproofes in wofull effects (For as all our mercyes and comforts are nothing elſe but the promiſes made viſible; ſo all the judgements which God brings upon the world, are nothing but his reproofes and threatnings made viſible, when (I ſay) he brings forth his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofes in wofull effects) how deſperately and indeed (though it may ſeeme a contradiction) how preſumptuouſly are they hardned in ſin, whoſe ey never affects their heart, who can ſee ſuch reproofs of God yet never tremble. It is ſaid in the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment ſhould be openly executed upon the preſumptuous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 17.13.) that <hi>all the people ſhould heare and feare, and doe no more preſumptuouſly;</hi> if all upon the hearing, ſhould feare, and feare ſo as to doe ſo no more, how much more ſhould all that ſee feare, and doe ſo no more?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, What ſhall we ſay of thoſe who not onely heare and ſee the reproofes of God, but feele them alſo, and yet tremble not: when the rod is upon their backs, a ſword in their bowels, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments round about them, and death climbing up at their win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, yet they are not aſtoniſhed; they are not onely <hi>word proofe,</hi> but <hi>judgement proofe:</hi> they are not ſencible of what they feele, they are ſmiteen, yet not ſicke, ſorrow and griefe of heart touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them not, though they are ſmitten for their ſins, and peirced with many ſorrows. They are ſo farre from being troubled at the remembrance of former ſins while they ſmart under preſent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, that with wicked King <hi>Ahaz</hi> they ſin yet more againſt God in the time of their affliction. They are ſo farre from turning as wiſedome counſelleth us (<hi>Pro:</hi> 1.23.) at the verbal reproofes of God, or at the reproofes of his mouth, that they will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne while he reproves them with his hand. Surely, at laſt the trembling pillars of heaven ſhall reprove them, who tremble not, nor are aſtoniſhed at the reproofes of God.</p>

The workes of God in ordering the workes of nature, beare the reſemblance of his workes among the children of men; His repreſſing the raging of the Sea, looketh like his repreſſing the rage of the wicked who are like the troubled Sea.</p>
                  <q>He divideth the Sea by his power.</q>
                  <p>We may take that act two wayes, eyther, firſt, as dividing is uſed in an ordinary ſenſe, to cut out and part one thing or one peece of a thing from another. It is a great and powerfull worke of God, to divide the Sea, or the whole bulke of waters to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parts of the world, and for the accommodation of ſeverall Countries. At firſt the waters covered the whole earth, <hi>all was a great deepe, and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters,</hi> (Gen. 1.2.) Nothing was to be ſeene, or there was no face of any thing but water. And therefore as it is ſayd (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.7.) that <hi>the Lord ſeparated or divided the waters which were under the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament from the waters which were above the firmament.</hi> So (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.9.) <hi>God ſaid let the waters under the heavens be gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into one place, and let the dry land appeare, and it was ſo, and God called the dry land earth, and the gathering together of waters he called Sea.</hi> And as that Scripture in <hi>Geneſis</hi> ſheweth that the Sea is the Gathering together of waters; ſo other Scriptures ſhew that the waters of the Sea are divided or run out in ſeverall Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The 104<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Pſalme is a continued meditation of the mighty
<pb n="795" facs="tcp:153845:412"/> power of God put forth both in creation and providence; where the Pſalmiſt having ſayd of God (<hi>v.</hi> 5.) <hi>Who layd the foundations of the earth that it ſhould not be removed for ever;</hi> he addeth (<hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 8.) <hi>Thou covereſt it</hi> (that is, the whole earth) <hi>with the deepe as with a garment; the waters ſtood above the mountaines,</hi> (that is, the waters were higher then the higheſt mountaines.) But what did God then? <hi>at thy rebuke they fled, at the voyce of thy thunder they haſted away</hi> (that is, when thou didſt ſpeake powerfully and ſtrongly to them, as with the voyce of thunder) <hi>they goe up by the mountaines, they goe downe by the valleys, unto the place which thou haſt founded for them; thou haſt ſet them bounds that they may not paſſe over, that they returne not againe to cover the earth.</hi> As the waters are now put into one great veſſel, ſo they are caryed out in ſeverall great channels all the world over for the conveniency of trafficke, and for the more eaſie entercourſe of nation with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Broughton</hi> expounds his tranſlation fully to this purpoſe; <hi>Of a Generall water, he made many;</hi> and he tranſlates the latter part of the verſe fully to that ſence; <hi>And by his wiſedome he parted the maine water,</hi> or <hi>pride,</hi> that is, the proud Sea; that threatneth to drowne the land. So that though the Sea be but one body of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, yet it is divided into many members, and receaves different names, according to the differing names, whether of Iſlands or Continents, whoſe ſhoares it waſheth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others expound this diviſion of the Sea, of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent motion of the Sea. So, <hi>He divideth the Sea,</hi> is, he maketh the Sea rage, and waters riſe up againſt waters, as perſons or nations doe when they are divided among themſelves. Sometimes the Sea is (as if it were) all of one peice, in union, and concord, all is calme and quiet; by and by, the Lord divides the Sea, ſets wave againſt wave, flood againſt flood, water againſt water, as if the Sea were broken into a thouſand factions. It is ſayd in that myſticall Scripture (<hi>Dan:</hi> 7.2.) <hi>That the Prophet ſaw in his viſion by night, and Behold the foure winds of heaven ſtrove upon the great Sea;</hi> That is, there were great troubles and commotions rayſed in all parts of the world, which vexed, divided, and turmoyled the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, even as the Sea is when boyſterous winds, eſpecially when all the winds are let out of priſon to ſtrive and contend with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Men make many fights at Sea, and God many times makes the Seas fight. Which fightings and dividings of the Sea, are a
<pb n="796" facs="tcp:153845:413"/> cleare embleme of all the diviſions and fights, which ariſe among men, and are acted eyther at Land or Sea.</p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>The diviſions, ſtormes, and ragings of the Sea are by the power of God.</q>
                  <p>The Pſalmiſt is much upon this, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.23, 24, 25.) <hi>They that goe downe to the Sea in ſhips, that doe buſienes in great waters, theſe ſee the workes of the Lord in the deepe, for he commandeth and rayſeth up the ſtormy winde, which lifted up the waves thereof,</hi> (where note, they are lifted up by Gods command) <hi>they mount up to the heaven, they goe downe againe to the depths, their ſoule is mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted becauſe of trouble.</hi> (Jon: 1.4.) <hi>The Lord ſent out a great winde into the Sea, and there was a mighty tempeſt in the Sea.</hi> (Jere: 10.13.) God is ſaid <hi>to bring the winde out of his treaſure</hi> (and <hi>Prov:</hi> 30.4.) <hi>To gather the winde in his fiſt.</hi> The winde is ſent out, and the winde is gathered in, 'tis treaſured up, and 'tis diſburſed out by his owne appoyntment to ſerve his providences and deſignes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, both in mercy and in Judgement.</p>
                  <p>We may hence inferre, that
<q>As the Lord divideth the Sea, ſo the Earth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When men are all of a minde, all as one man, he can ſever and divide their ſpirits, and then cauſe them to daſh againſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like the waves of a tempeſtuous Sea. The old world was of one minde, but the Lord came downe, and divided them, when he ſaw them united in that worke (<hi>Gen.</hi> 11.6.) <hi>The people are one, and they have all one language, and this they begin to doe, and now nothing will be reſtrained from them which they have imagined to doe, ſo the Lord confounded their language, and ſcattered them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad;</hi> They were building a <hi>Babel</hi> to ſecure themſelves againſt a ſecond deluge, and to get <hi>them a name leſt they ſhould be ſcattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.</hi> Therefore God brought their feares upon them, and ſcattered them. <hi>We lay our ſelves moſt open to that judgement, which we labour moſt to prevent in a ſinfull way.</hi> As there are diviſions among men which are their ſin, ſo God ſends diviſions among men which are their puniſhment. And as God ſends diviſions among men for the puniſhment of ſome, ſo for the probation or tryall of others. Chriſt ſaith (<hi>Math:</hi> 10.35.
<pb n="797" facs="tcp:153845:413"/> 
                     <hi>I am come to ſet a man at variance againſt his father, and the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with her mother, and the daughter in law againſt her mother in law; and a mans enemies ſhall be they of his owne houſe.</hi> Such divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions the Lord makes on the earth, that it may appeare how ſtrongly and immoveably his faithfull ones are united unto him. As we are to aſcribe our union, ſo our diviſions to God; it is he that ordereth all theſe things, though they flow from the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, pride, and ſelfeiſhneſſe of men. When there are diviſions and emulations among us, we ſhew our ſelves (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 3.3.) and walke as men; But God ſheweth himſelfe righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and acteth as God; <hi>He divideth the Sea by his power,</hi> 
                     <q>And by his underſtanding he ſmiteth through the proud.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The dividing of the Sea was aſcribed to the power of God in the former part of the verſe,<note place="margin">

The word ſignifies to ſtrike ſo, as to deſtroy, or kill, to ſtrike dead. (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 30.26. <hi>Numb:</hi> 24.8.) <hi>God ſtriketh home when he ſtriketh the proud.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But who or what are the proud ones, whom God ſmiteth through? The word is <hi>Rahab,</hi> (as was toucht before in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall interpretation of the verſe) ſignifies two things; firſt, ſtrength, ſo ſome render it here; <hi>By his underſtanding he ſmiteth through ſtrength;</hi> that is, <hi>thoſe things which are ſtrongeſt.</hi> The very weakeneſſe of God is ſtronger then man, and therefore there is nothing ſo ſtrong, but God can quickly ſmite it through or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it. Secondly, it ſignifyeth pride, becauſe men uſually are proud of their ſtrength; whence that caution (<hi>Jer.</hi> 9.23.) <hi>Let not the mighty man glory in his might.</hi> Any kinde of ſtrength is apt to make man proud; the ſtrength of his eſtate, and purſe, is a great temptation to pride; ſtrength of body, ſtrength of parts, ſtrength of wit and underſtanding (which is the higheſt, and nobleſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſtrength) puts on to pride, yea (ſo ſtrange are the wayes and methods of temptation) the very ſtrength of grace or ſpirituall ſtrength hath blowne up ſome with pride; For though humility flow properly from the ſtrength of grace, and the more grace the more humility, yet upon a preſumption of the greatneſſe and ſtrength of their graces, ſome have been proud and high-minded, that is, they have not lived in ſuch dependance upon Chriſt as they ought. Our ſtrength lyes much in the ſence of our weakenes,
<pb n="798" facs="tcp:153845:414"/> becauſe, then we goe out of our ſelves to Chriſt for ſtrength, that is the meaning of the Apoſtles confeſſion, <hi>When I am weake, then am I ſtrong</hi> (2 Cor. 12.10.) And they who are ſtrong in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, muſt needs be weake, becauſe the ſtrength of God goeth out againſt them. And therefore it will not be unprofitable for us, before I come to the ſpeciall explication of the proud here intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to meditate upon and make uſe of this Scripture in the full la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude &amp; compaſſe of the word. For whoſoever he is that is proud, whether he be proud of his naturall or civill or ſupernaturall ſtrength, let him looke to himſelfe, God underſtandeth him, and by his underſtanding he will <hi>ſmite through the proud.</hi> The proud man is alwayes in danger of falling, though (becauſe of his pride) he leaſt of all men, eyther feareth or ſuſpecteth a fall. How can they be ſafe againſt whom God hath declared himſelfe an enemy. There's no armour of proofe againſt the ſtroakes of God, if God ſmite as an enemy, he ſmiteth through, and ſo he alwayes ſmiteth the proud. <hi>Saul</hi> attempted more then once to ſmite <hi>David</hi> to the wall with his Javelin; yet <hi>David</hi> avoyded his blow and got out of his furious preſence; But when God caſteth his Javelin at the proud, they ſhall not eſcape a ſmiting through and nayling to the wall. <hi>By his underſtanding he ſmiteth through the proud.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But more diſtinctly, who is the proud in the text whom God ſmiteth through?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some ſay the <hi>Devill;</hi> He indeed is the <hi>proud one,</hi> his pride was his fall from God, and God hath ſmitten him through for his pride.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others underſtand by the proud, <hi>the whale in the Sea;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Et ſcientia ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus eſt cetus. <hi>70 i. e</hi> ſuo imperio ſubegit.</note> thus the <hi>ſeventy</hi> tranſlate, <hi>and by his knowledge he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Whale or Leviathan,</hi> of whom the Lord ſaith (in the 41<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of this booke, <hi>v.</hi> 34.) <hi>He is a king over all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of pride.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>God knoweth how to bring downe the Sea in its greateſt rage and pride.</q>
                  <p>God doth it by his underſtanding, as wel as by his power; As God hath power enough to divide the Sea, and make it ſtormy, ſo he hath underſtanding enough to calme and quiet it. We read (<hi>Math:</hi> 8.23, 24, 25, 26, 27.) <hi>That Chriſt being entred into a ſhip with his Diſciples, a great tempeſt aroſe, inſomuch that the ſhip was covered with the waves, but he was aſleepe. And his Diſciples came to him and awoke him, ſaying, Lord ſave us we periſh. And he ſaith unto them, why are ye fearefull, O ye of little faith? then he aroſe and rebuked the winds and the Sea, and there was a great calme.</hi> This is a plaine exemplification and expoſition of <hi>Jobs</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, <hi>by his underſtanding he ſmiteth through the proud;</hi> When the Sea was as furious as a mad man, who hath loſt his reaſon, and will heare none, yet then Chriſt by his divine power and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome made it as obedient as they who have and act moſt reaſon are, when they heare the moſt rational and preſſing perſwaſions, or (we may ſay) that he huſht the Sea as a mother doth her cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing childe, and rock't it into a ſleepe; yea he doth not onely calme
<pb n="800" facs="tcp:153845:415"/> the Sea, but kill it, or ſtrike it dead (as the word of the text im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports.) There is a particular ſea which is called <hi>The Dead Sea,</hi> But God can make all the ſeas <hi>Dead Seas,</hi> and then he delights moſt to doe it, when they threaten to ſwallow up all living.</p>
                  <p>This may be a great ſupport to us among the ſtormes which we meete with here at land. When men and nations are divided and raging againſt one another, God can quiet them; It is an eaſie matter to make diviſions among men, but it calls for much holy skill and wiſedome, even the wiſedome of God, to heale and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them. And when the ſpirits of men are proudeſt and lifted up like the high waves of the ſea, then uſually tis Gods time to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare and ſtrike them through At his word (as the Prophet ſpeakes, <hi>Iſa:</hi> 11.13.) <hi>The envy of Ephraim ſhall depart, and the adverſaries of Judah ſhall be cut off, Ephraim ſhall not envy Judah, and Judah ſhall not vexe Ephraim.</hi> Whence is it that <hi>Ephraim</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyeth <hi>Judah?</hi> whence is it that <hi>Judah</hi> vexeth <hi>Ephraim?</hi> is it not from their pride? ſaith not <hi>Solomon</hi> (Pro: 13.10.) <hi>By pride com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth contention.</hi> How then ſhall the contention between <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> ceaſe, but by <hi>ſtriking through their pride?</hi> When there is leſſe pride among men, there will be more peace, and God will ſmite the proudeſt rather then his people ſhall not have peace. As the <hi>Jewes</hi> were divided among themſelves, ſo likewiſe were the Jewes and Gentiles, <hi>Till Chriſt reconciling both to God in one body by the Croſſe, did ſlay enmity thereby</hi> (Eph: 2.16.) And how did he ſlay their their enmity, even by ſmiting through their pride, and humbling their ſpirits under his owne croſſe or ſufferings, by which, and the throane of Grace, they were at once reconciled to God, and one to another.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That God</hi> who can appeaſe the rage of the proud ſeas, can alſo appeaſe or deſtroy the rage of the proudeſt men who oppoſe his people. So ſome underſtand that, (<hi>Zech:</hi> 10.11.) where we have a propheſie of bringing the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Aſſyria</hi> into their owne land; <hi>And he ſhall paſſe through the ſea with affliction, and he ſhall ſmite through the waves in the ſea, and all the deeps of the river ſhall dry up;</hi> that is, Chriſt the deliverer of his people, ſhall paſſe through the nations who are like the red Sea, ſtanding in the way of his peoples returne, and he will afflict them, or bring much affliction upon them, and he will ſmite thoſe who like proud waves ſhall threaten to ſwallow them
<pb n="801" facs="tcp:153845:415"/> up; ſo that <hi>the deepes of the river,</hi> even thoſe hindrances, which it was thought could never be removed, ſhall dry up at his command or rebuke, <hi>and the pride of Aſſyria ſhall be brought downe, and the ſcepter of Egypt ſhall depart away,</hi> that is, they who ſhall then be to the people of God, as <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Aſſyria</hi> were of old, hard Taske-maſters and leaders of them into Captivity, ſhall be ſubdued and removed, when they are proudeſt and in their greateſt power. 'Tis matter of ſtrong conſolation to all the faithfull, that they ſerve a God who is able to reconcile the divided ſpirits of his own people one to another, and cauſe all their envy to depart from them; who is able alſo to reconcile their greateſt adverſaryes to them, and eyther to ſtay their enmity, or to ſlay them as enemyes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, 'Tis matter of comfort to the people of God. For he who can appeaſe the rage of the Sea, can alſo appeaſe the rage of Satan, and ſmite through the proud waves of his Temptations. Satan goeth about continually to raiſe ſtormes, and vex poore ſoules; O the rage of temptation that many poore ſoules are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how doe the billowes of it riſe like a violent ſea, wave after wave, guſt after guſt. As God himſelfe rayſeth ſtormes of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation againſt a poore ſoule (thus <hi>David</hi> ſpake in his owne caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.7. <hi>Deepe calleth unto deepe at the noyſe of thy water-ſpouts: all thy waves and thy billowes are gone over me</hi>) which yet in due time he will appeaſe; ſo when Satan by his leave or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, direction or permiſſion rayſeth ſtormes of temptation, which he hath no mind to allay but rather to encreaſe and double dayly more and more, yet O wearyed and weather-beaten ſoule, be of good cheere, the Lord can ſmite through the proud enemy Satan, with all his floods, and waves of temptation, and make a calme.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Let them alſo remember this and be comforted who finde proud waves, proud luſts, and corruptions, ſtirring and raging like a Sea within them. For that which is ſaid by the Prophet of the wicked, is true in part of the righteous, and ſometimes it is in a very great meaſure fullfilled in them (<hi>The wicked are like the troubled Sea when it cannot reſt,</hi> (Iſa: 57.20.) that is, they are like the Sea in a ſtorme which is ſo, not onely becauſe of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe of their ſpirits about the providences and dealings of God with them, but becauſe their violent luſts hurry them this way and that way as the ſea is toyled and toſſed by the windes,
<pb n="802" facs="tcp:153845:416"/> this (I ſay) is true alſo in part of Saints) ſome more, ſome leſſe are like a troubled Sea, yea they have a Sea of ſinfull luſts within them, which the Lord is pleaſed ſometimes to divide and ſtirre up; their corruptions ſtorme and bluſter, and Satan labours to make them bluſter more &amp; more. We dayly heare the complaints and cryes of ſoules, thus toſſed, comming to Chriſt, as his Diſciples once did, and crying to him, <hi>Maſter ſave us we periſh;</hi> we feare we ſhall be over-whelmed and drowned in this Blacke Sea of our corruptions. To ſuch Chriſt ſaith, <hi>O ye of little faith,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do ye thus feare, cannot I ſmite through the proud, the proud waves of your hearts. Is <hi>unbeliefe</hi> the proud wave, that ye feare will ſwallow you up? Chriſt can give you ſuch an encreaſe of faith as ſhall ſwallow up your unbeliefe; is <hi>pride</hi> it ſelfe the proud wave that is like to overwhelme you? Chriſt who ſmiteth through the proud in Judgement, will alſo ſmite through thy pride in mercy. It is a great act of Grace in man to deſire God to ſtrike through his pride, and it is a great act of mercy to man when God doth ſo. The more God ſmiteth our ſins, the more he declares his love to and his care of our ſoules. The remainders of pride in the Saints ſhall be ſmitten through; but ſinners who remaine in their pride ſhall be ſmitten through themſelves. God whoſe power and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding are made known by ſmiting through the proud waves of the Sea, will at laſt make his Juſtice and his holynes knowne by ſmiting through the proud hearts of men, or rather men of proud hearts. Proud men ſtrike at God, yea kicke againſt him, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then if he ſtrike and kicke them. All the ſufferings of Chriſt are wrapt up under that one word, <hi>His humiliation,</hi> implying that as he was ſmitten for all our ſins, ſo moſt of all for our pride. That man whoſe pride is not ſmitten to death or mortifyed by the death of Chriſt, ſhall ſurely be ſmitten to death, even to eternall death for his pride. As God underſtandeth thoroughly who are proud, ſo <hi>by his underſtanding he will ſmite through the proud.</hi>

                  <p>If it be asked, what <hi>is this garniſhing of the heavens?</hi> I anſwer, the ſetting or placing in of thoſe excellent lights, Sunne, Moone and Starres in the heavens, are the garniſhing of them. Light is beautifull, and the more light any thing hath, the more beauty it hath. Precious ſtones have much light in them; thoſe lights the Starres are as ſo many ſtones of beauty and glory ſet or moving in the heavens. Light as diffuſed and ſhed abroad in the ayre is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding delightfull and beautifull, but light as it is contracted and drawne together into the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, is farre more beautifull; light in the ayre pleaſeth the eye, but light in the Sunne conquers and dazzel's the eye by the exceſſive beauty and
<pb n="805" facs="tcp:153845:417"/> brightneſſe of it. In the firſt day of the Creation God ſayd; <hi>Let there be light, and there was light;</hi> but in the fourth day <hi>he ſayd, let there be lights,</hi> that is, let there be ſeverall veſſells, to receave, hold, and containe light, and then to iſſue it out among the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the earth (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.14.) <hi>And God ſayd, let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from the night: and let them be for ſignes, and for ſeaſons, and for dayes, and for yeares, and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth; and it was ſo. And God made two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the leſſer light to rule the night; he made the ſtarres alſo; and God ſet them in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the heaven, to give light upon the earth.</hi> God in Creation did with the light, as he did with the waters, which being made were divided, the waters above the firmament were divided from the waters under the firmament, and <hi>the waters under the heaven he gathered together into one place</hi> (Gen. 1.9.)

                     <hi>Moſes</hi> epitomiſeth or briefly ſumms up his larger narrative of the Creation in theſe words (<hi>Gen:</hi> 2.1.) <hi>Thus the heavens and the earth were finiſhed and all the hoſt of them,</hi> that is, they were finiſhed not onely as to their eſſentials, but ornamentalls; not only was the foundation layd, the walls and pillars, the beames and raf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that goodly ſtructure ſet up and perfected, but all the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of it was brought in, and the beautyes of it compleated. Now, as gemms, minerals, plants, trees, and all living creatures are the Garniſhing of the Earth and the hoſt of God there, ſo the Sunne, Moone, and Starrs, are the garniſhing of heaven, and the hoſt of God there. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh of theſe diſtinctly (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.6.) <hi>By the word of the Lord were the heavens made: and all the hoſt of them, by the breath of his mouth.</hi> All creatures whether placed in heaven or earth, are for their number, their ſtrength, their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, their readynes at a call or command, the hoſt of God.

                  <p>Onely here take notice, that ſome expound the word <hi>Spirit,</hi> for the <hi>winde</hi> which bloweth in the ayre, and ſo render the text thus; <hi>By his winde hee garniſheth the heavens;</hi> As if this were <hi>Jobs</hi> meaning, that God ſending forth the windes diſpelleth and ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thoſe clouds, foggs, and miſts, which often cover the face of the heavens, and hinder our beholding their glory and garniſhings. According to this interpretation <hi>the garniſhing of the heavens</hi> is nothing elſe but the removing of that which obſcureth the Garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of them. And it is true, that when the heavens are maskt over with clouds and darkneſſe, God by the winds cleareth the ayre, and ſo reneweth the face of thoſe heavenly bodyes.

                  <p>Secondly, Seing God hath been ſo bountifull and munificent, as to Garniſh the heavens for us, even for us, by his Spirit; ſeing he hath provided ſuch a houſe for the comfort of our lives here, who never deſerved the meaneſt cottage; how ſhould we pray that he would Garniſh our ſoules by the Spirit, as a heaven for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to dwell in: or as the Apoſtle ſpeakes (<hi>Eph.</hi> 2.22.) <hi>That we may be builded for an habitation of God through the Spirit.</hi> God hath two houſes, <hi>an upper houſe, and a lower houſe;</hi> The heaven of heavens is his upper houſe, and the heaven of an holy and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart is his lower. God is every where, but he dwelleth no where but in a heaven; He dwelleth not in the heart of any man, till that be made a heaven, and that a heaven Garniſhed by the Spirit. As the Sunne Moone and Starres are the garniſhing of the naturall heaven, ſo holy knowledge and the graces, faith, hope and love, are the Garniſhing of thoſe ſpirituall heavens, the hearts of the ſons of men. And untill their hearts be thus garniſhed, they are not an heaven for God, but a hell or habitation for the devill; and he puts furniture and garniſhings into them ſutable to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and fitting his owne entertainement. We read in the Goſpel (<hi>Math:</hi> 12.43, 44.) That, <hi>when the uncleane Spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, ſeeking reſt and findeth none; Then he ſaith, I will returne into my houſe from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty ſwept and garniſhed.</hi> Luſts and corruptions, unbeliefe, pride; wrath, envy, theſe are the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhings of Satans houſe. And as he delighteth moſt to dwel there where he findeth moſt of theſe Garniſhings; ſo God delighteth moſt to dwel in that ſoule which is moſt Garniſhed with grace. Then pray, and pray earneſtly, that God who hath garniſhed the heavens by his Spirit for our uſe, would alſo garniſh our hearts by his Spirit, for his owne uſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As this ſhould provoke us to pray that our hearts may be garniſhed as a houſe of delight, that God may dwel in us; So it ſhould provoke us to garniſh our lives, that God may be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by us. And as God hath not onely made a good world for us, as to the matter, but made it pleaſant, and adorn'd it for us: ſo we ſhould ſtrive not onely to doe that which is good for the matter, but to put ornaments upon it, and make it pleaſant to our utmoſt in the eyes of God. We ſhould garniſh our workes as God hath garniſhed his; God hath (as it were) poliſht and engraven
<pb n="809" facs="tcp:153845:419"/> his workes for us by exquiſite art and skill, ſo that the workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is better then the matter; and ſhall we ſatisfie our ſelves, if we doe that which is good for the matter, though we beſtow no coſt, no holy skill and workmanſhip upon it? ſhall we ſerve God onely <hi>with plaine worke,</hi> when we ſee how curious and elaborate his workes are? I grant, <hi>plaine worke</hi> is beſt, and moſt pleaſing to God, as <hi>plainenes</hi> is oppoſed to hypocriſie; but plaine worke is not beſt as plainenes is oppoſed to exactnes. God loves to ſee ſome lace and trimming (in ſincerity) upon what we doe; that is, it pleaſeth him, when he ſeeth that we do our beſt, and that we not onely doe good, but garniſh (to his prayſe) the good we doe; he would have us not onely walke in the truth, but honour the truth by our walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; He would have us not onely obey the doctrine, but (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Tit:</hi> 2.10.) <hi>Adorne the doctrine of God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in all things,</hi> or (to uſe <hi>Jobs</hi> language) <hi>Garniſh it,</hi> as he <hi>by his Spirit hath garniſhed the heavens.</hi>

                     <hi>His hand,</hi> that is, his power; hands are aſcribed to God in a figure, or in alluſion to men, who doe all their externall workes by their hands. The hand is a noble and moſt ſerviceable Organ or Inſtrument, and therefore the Great things which God hath done, eſpecially the heavens, are called <hi>the worke of his hands, and his handy-worke</hi> (Pſal. 19.1.) yea the heavens are called <hi>the worke of his fingers</hi> (Pſal. 8.3.) Which notes (I conceave) the exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and curioſity of the worke, for ſuch are thoſe things which are wrought by the fingers.

<pb n="810" facs="tcp:153845:420"/> is this ſerpent? Divers interpretens connect the ſence of theſe words with the former part of the verſe, and ſo place this <hi>crooked ſerpent</hi> in the heavens, as belonging to the <hi>Garniſhing</hi> of them, or as if <hi>Job</hi> were giving a particular inſtance of what God hath done towards the <hi>garniſhing</hi> of the heavens; <hi>His hand hath formed the crooked ſerpent.</hi> By which they underſtand the coeleſtiall circles or ſpheares which are wrapt and involved one within another, as a ſerpent wrappeth or twineth himſelfe in ſeveral rounds.</p>
                  <p>Another following the ſame ſence expoundeth it of that which Aſtronomers call the <hi>milkey way,</hi> which is a beauty in heaven; It being (as it were) the coalition of a number of little ſtarrs,<note place="margin">Vatablus viam lacteam intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git.</note> which becauſe they looke <hi>white and milkiſh,</hi> are therefore called the <hi>mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key way;</hi> Which alſo hath ſomewhat of the forme of a ſerpent, as is evident to the eye of any diligent obſerver.</p>
                  <p>A third, keeping ſtill to that ſence, expoundeth it yet more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of that ſpeciall conſtellation in the heavens knowne among Aſtronomers by the name of <hi>the dragon or ſerpent;</hi> Which is ſuppoſed to be ſpoken of here by <hi>Job</hi> ſynecdochically, putting a part for the whole, or one for all the other Conſtellations with which the heavens are garniſhed; As if it had been ſayd, <hi>His hand hath formed the crooked ſerpent,</hi> that is, all the Starres in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſhapes and configurations, among which one repreſenteth the forme of a Lion, another of a Beare, another of a Ram, and among many others one appeareth in the forme of a <hi>Dragon or Crooked Serpent, ſhooting himſelfe forth or forward like the bolt of a doore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I finde a fourth ſort, who though they keepe the <hi>crooked ſerpent</hi> of the Text ſtill in the heavens, yet they bring it downe to a lower heaven, that is, from the ſtarry heaven, or from that heaven which is the Subject of the Starres to the ayery heaven, which is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or ſhop in which the meteors, of all ſorts, are bred and formed, and among them there is a meteor called by Naturaliſts, <hi>the flying ſerpent.</hi> As if the meaning of theſe words, <hi>His hand hath formed the crooked ſerpent,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Draco vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans.</note> were this; God hath wrought and formed by his power &amp; wiſdome all thoſe fiery meteors that are often ſeene as it were flying and ſhooting in the ayre, to the wonder of many, and the aſtoniſhment of not a few. There are the treaſures of the ſnow and of the hayle, there God prepareth a way for the lightning of the thunder (<hi>Job.</hi> 38.22.25.) Some learned interpreters inſiſt much upon this Expoſition, placing the <hi>crooked ſerpent</hi> in the
<pb n="811" facs="tcp:153845:420"/> heavens, eyther the upper or lower, as hath been ſhewed under foure diſtinct titles: nor can it be denyed, but that the hand of God hath wrought all theſe things, much leſſe can it be denyed that the working of theſe things is a great argument and demonſtration of the power and wiſedome of God, which is the purpoſe of <hi>Job</hi> in this place; therefore I ſhall not totally lay it aſide. Neyther yet will I leave it with the reader as the ſpeciall meaning of this place, for this reaſon, becauſe I much doubt, whether thoſe poeticall phancyes in giving ſuch fictitious names to the Starres of heaven, as, <hi>The Lion, the Beare, the Bull, the Dragon, the Serpent,</hi> &amp;c. of which Philoſophers and Aſtronomers have made uſe, were at all borne, or ever ſo much as heard of in thoſe elder times in which and before which <hi>Job</hi> lived. For though both in the 9th Chapter of this booke (<hi>v.</hi> 9.) as alſo in the 38th Chapter (<hi>v.</hi> 21, 22.) many Names are given to the Starres, which both the Greeke and Latine tranſlaters, and we following them in the Engliſh, render by thoſe poeticall names, yet The Original Hebrew words beare no alluſion at all to thoſe phancyes. As for inſtance, The Hebrew word which we render <hi>Arcturus</hi> (Chap: 9.9.) hath nothing at all in it ſignifying, <hi>The Tayle of a Beare.</hi> But here in this text, the word properly ſignifyeth a <hi>crooked ſerpent;</hi> and therefore to place it in the heavens as a Starre, when as in the times when this was written, there is ſo little, if any probability at all, that any ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions were taken up by any, or any ſuch alluſive names gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Starres, ſeemes to me ſomewhat improper.</p>
                  <p>There is another veine of interpretation carrying the ſence of theſe words, <hi>His hand hath formed the crooked ſerpent,</hi> to quite another poynt; for 'tis conceaved by the Authors of this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that as <hi>Job</hi> gave inſtance before in the workes of God above, his higheſt workes in nature, the garniſhing of the heavens; ſo hee now giveth inſtance in his workes below, or in his loweſt workes. This general interpretation is delivered two wayes diſtinctly.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That as God hath garniſhed the heavens, ſo he hath made and now governeth hel too, <hi>His hand hath formed the croc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſerpent,</hi> that is, the Devill: That which favoureth this opinion, and hath poſſibly caſt the thoughts of many upon it, is, that in Scripture the devil is often called <hi>a ſerpent,</hi> yea a <hi>crooked ſerpent,</hi> and that he acted a ſerpent as his inſtrument in the firſt temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1.) <hi>Now the ſerpent was more ſubtile then any of the
<pb n="812" facs="tcp:153845:421"/> beaſts of the feild, which the Lord God had made, and he ſayd unto the woman,</hi> that is, The Devill in or by the Serpent ſayd unto her, &amp;c. He hath wel deſerved to be called a Serpent who acted his firſt malice againſt mankinde by the helpe of a Serpent; And for his thus early making uſe of a Serpent, he is called not only a ſerpent, but, <hi>that old Serpent, (Rev.</hi> 12.9.) <hi>The great Dragon was caſt out, that old Serpent, called the Devill, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was caſt out into the earth, and his Angells were caſt out with him.</hi> The hand of God hath formed this crooked ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. To cleare which ſome interpret the former part of the verſe in, complyance with this ſence, for the good Angells, thus; <hi>By his Spirit he hath Garniſhed the heavens;</hi>

Therefore though the Devill according to his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal or general nature, as an Angel was formed of God; yet the crookednes of his nature as wel as of his wayes, which properly and formally denominate him a Devill was of himſelfe, he having turned away from God, and defiled that ſtate, by the freedom of his own will, in which he was created pure, and had ſociety with his fellow-Angels,<note place="margin">Eduxit deus diabolum è me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio Angelorum. <hi>Aquin:</hi>

Thus the Pſalmiſt deſcribing the great workes of God, putteth the Leviathan or Whale among the chiefeſt of them (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.24, 25, 26.) <hi>O Lord, how manifold are thy workes! in wiſedome haſt thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches; ſo is the great and wide Sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both ſmall and great beaſts.

The hand of God hath formed Leviathan, and a hand leſſe powerfull then his could not forme a ſhrimpe. As Jeſus Chriſt was declared many wayes to be the Son of God, but (as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4.) <hi>He was declared to be the Son of God with power</hi> (or <hi>powerfully declared to be the Son of God) by the reſurrection from the dead.</hi> So all things that are created declare that their Creator is God; But he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared with power or powerfully declared to be God by many of the creatures. Who can make any thing to live, but the living God? Who can make Great things, but the Great God? <hi>His hand hath formed the crooked ſerpent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſeing the Lord hath formed the crooked ſerpent, even thoſe creatures that are moſt dreadfull and dangerous to man; then the moſt dreadfull and dangerous creatures are under the power of God, hee formed them, and therefore he can reſtraine and curb them. As it is ſayd of <hi>Behemoth</hi> (Job 40.19.) <hi>He that made him can make his ſword approach unto him,</hi> that is, though he be too ſtrong for man, yet God who gave him that ſtrength, hath infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more, and can eaſily Maſter him, yea and give a weake man skill and power to doe it: ſo though it be ſayd (<hi>Job</hi> 41.26.) of Leviathan that the ſword of him that layeth at him cannot hold,
<pb n="816" facs="tcp:153845:423"/> the ſpeare, the dart, nor the habergeon, yet God, who made him, can make his ſword approach to him, or as ſome render the words under hand, <hi>His hand hath and can wound Leviathan the crooked Serpent; He can put a hooke in his noſe, and bore his jaw through with a thorne.</hi> And thus God can doe alſo with thoſe, who are Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathans, and crooked Serpents in a figure, The Devill, and all cruel-minded men who doe his worke, and cary on his deſigne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the people of God, as is expreſſed in that lately alledged Scripture (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.1.) <hi>In that day the Lord with his ſore and great and ſtrong ſword ſhall puniſh Leviathan, the peircing Serpent,</hi> that is, thoſe enemyes and perſecuters of his people, who ſeeme to be as ſtrong and invincible as Leviathan, and as ſubtle and dangerous as the moſt peircing ſtinging Serpent. Thus the Lord aſſured his faithfull ones (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 54.16, 17.) <hi>That no weapon formed againſt them ſhould proſper; for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have created the Smith that bloweth the coales in the fire, and that bringeth forth an Inſtrument for his worke, and I have created the waſter to deſtroy.</hi> Therefore I can hinder the waſter from deſtroying, and make all his weapons edgeleſſe, poyntleſſe, no more able to wound, then a ſtraw or a ruſh. How ſoone can God blunt and abate the keeneſt ſpirits of men, and weaken their ſtrongeſt armes, when he ſeeth they will but doe miſchiefe with them? He that cauſeth motion can ſtop it; and he that giveth power can call it in, or breake it where it is. While God is on our ſide who made all, we need not feare who are made againſt us; Though they have teeth like Lyons, and ſtings like Serpents we are ſafe; The hand of God can kill and wound, for, <hi>His Hand hath formed the crooked Serpent.</hi>

<pb n="822" facs="tcp:153845:426"/> reaſon is becauſe what ever is ſayd of the wayes, and workes of God, is to diſcover God, rather then to diſcover them. To ſpeake of the earth and ſeas, of the ayre and fire, of thunder and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, of the heavens and ſtarres, is not an extolling of the workes of God, but an extolling of God in and for his workes.</p>

A criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal eye lookes upon a picture, not ſo much to ſee the colours or the paint, as to diſcerne the skill and workmanſhip of the Painter or Limner, yea ſome (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes in reference <hi>to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualls</hi>) have ſences ſo exerciſed about <hi>theſe artificialls,</hi> that they will read the <hi>Artiſts</hi> name in the forme and exquiſitenes of his art; An <hi>Apelles</hi> or a <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> needs not put his name to his worke, his worke proclaimes his name to thoſe who are judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious beholders of ſuch kinde of workes: How much more (as the Pſalmiſt ſpeakes) <hi>that the name of God is neere, doe his wondrous workes</hi> (both of creation and providence) <hi>declare</hi> to all diſcreete beholders? that which the eye and heart of every godly man is cheifely upon, is to find out and behold <hi>The name,</hi> that is, the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, power and goodnes of God in all his workes, both of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and providence; It were better for us never to enjoy the creature, then not to enjoy God in it; and it were better for us not to ſee the creature, then not to have a ſight of God in it; And yet when we have ſeene the moſt of God which the creature can ſhew us, we have reaſon to ſay, <hi>how little a portion is ſeene of him?</hi> and when we have heard the moſt of God that can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to us from the creation, we have reaſon to ſay, as <hi>Job</hi> here doth, <hi>how little a portion is heard of him?</hi> and to conclude as he doth this verſe and Chapter.</p>
                  <q>But the thunder of his power who can underſtand?</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This thunder of his power,</hi> may be taken,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Strictly, and in the letter for natural thunder; for, even
<pb n="823" facs="tcp:153845:426"/> that is numbred in Scripture among the wonderfull and moſt dreadfull workes of God. The Scripture calleth it alſo the voyce of God (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 29.3.) <hi>The voyce of the Lord is upon the waters, the God of Glory thundereth.</hi>

                     <hi>to him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old, lo he doth ſend out his voyce, and that a mighty voyce.</hi> Thus alſo the Prophet <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayah</hi> (Chap: 30.30.) deſcribes the Lord comming forth for the reſcue of his people, and the utter ruine of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army. <hi>And the Lord ſhall cauſe his glorious voyce to be heard, and ſhall ſhew the lightning downe of his arme, with the indignation of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and with the flame of a deveuring fire, with ſcattering, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, and haileſtones.</hi> For though that deſtruction of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> was effected by the miniſtery of an Angel (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 37.36.) yet, doubtleſſe it was not done in ſilence, but eyther with an amazing tempeſt, mixt with thunder and lightning, or with ſuch confuſion and terror as appeared like one. In the Booke of the <hi>Revelation</hi> (which hath as one of the Ancients ſpeaketh, as <hi>many myſteryes as words</hi>) the dreadfull judgements prophecyed to come upon the world in the ſeverall Ages of it, are expreſſed by Thunder (<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi> 10.4.) <hi>And when the ſeven thunders had uttered their voyces, I was about to write: and I heard a voyce from heaven, ſaying unto mee, ſeale up thoſe things which the ſeven thunders uttered, and write them not.</hi> And as elſewhere, ſo eſpecially in this booke of <hi>Job,</hi> we find, thoſe things which carry the greateſt ſtrength and terror in them, expreſt by thunder (<hi>Job</hi> 39.19.) <hi>Haſt thou given the horſe ſtrength? haſt thou clothed his necke with thunder;</hi> that is, haſt thou made the horſe who is ſo ſtrong and terrible?

                     <hi>ha, ha; and he ſmelleth the battaile afarre of, the thunder of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and the ſhouting;</hi> that is, the horſe is pleaſed to heare the Great Commanders ſpeake with a loud voyce, eyther directing, threatning, or encouraging their Souldiers. Thus, <hi>the Thunder of Gods power,</hi> is ſome wonderfull act of his power, which lifts up its voyce (as it were) like Thunder. This <hi>who can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand?</hi> none can. The word ſignifyes alſo to weigh and conſider; ſo ſome render it here, <hi>Who can ſufficiently conſider the Thunder of his power?</hi> who can conſider it as he ought; eyther, firſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the depth and myſteriouſneſſe of it, or, ſecondly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the dignity and worthines of it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Theſe words, <hi>who can underſtand the thunder of his power?</hi> may be expounded of the higheſt and cleareſt publication of his power; The thundering of it out. As if <hi>Job</hi> had ſayd, <hi>I have whiſpered a little to you, but if God ſhould thunder out himſelfe, or if his workes were ſpoken out (as they deſerve) in thunder,</hi> the minds of men would be amazed, and their underſtandings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded; <hi>The thunder of his power who can underſtand?</hi> 'Tis uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all among the learned to expreſſe high eloquence, and ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of ſpeech, by thundering. It was ſayd of <hi>Alcibiades, that hee thundred Greece;</hi> He was a man ſo mighty in Elocution, that he made his hearers tremble. And hence <hi>Chriſt himſelfe ſurnamed two of his owne Diſciples (James the ſon of Zebedee, and John the Brother of James) Boanerges,</hi> which is, <hi>The Sons of Thunder.</hi> They did not ſpeake (as we ſay) <hi>like a mouſe in a cheeſe,</hi> but with a great voyce, and with a greater ſpirit; they ſpake the meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of heaven as if it thundered from heaven. There may be a great force in a low voyce, while what is ſpoken comes with much clearenes of reaſon, and ſtrength of Authority, or (as the Apoſtle gives it) <hi>in the evidence and demonſtration of the Spirit;</hi> but when all theſe are convayed by a mighty voyce, a voyce like thunder, how forceable are they? <hi>Baſil was ſayd to Thunder in his doctrine, and lighten in his life.</hi> Such (to the hight) was that voyce of words (in Mount <hi>Horeb</hi> at the giving of the Law) <hi>Which voyce they that heard, intreated that the Word ſhould not be ſpoken to them any more</hi> (Heb: 12.19.) that is, that it ſhould not be ſpoken to them any more in that manner, or by an immediate voyce from God, as appeares (<hi>Exod:</hi> 20. <hi>v:</hi> 18, 19.) <hi>And all
<pb n="825" facs="tcp:153845:427"/> the people ſaw the Thunderings and the lightnings, and the noyſe of the Trumpet,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And they ſayd unto Moſes, ſpeake thou with us and we will heare; but let not God ſpeake with us, leſt we dye. We cannot underſtand the Thunder of his power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note.</p>
                  <q>Man is not able to receave and beare thoſe higheſt diſcoveryes of God.</q>
                  <p>God can ſpeake in ſuch a light as will blind the eyes of man, and in ſuch a language as will rather aſtoniſh then inſtruct him. As among beleevers, they who are carnal and babes in Chriſt, are not able to eate <hi>ſtrong meate,</hi> they muſt <hi>be fed with milke</hi> (as the Apoſtles ſpeakes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.2.) So wee may ſay of all Beleevers, even of thoſe that are ſtrongeſt, God doth onely whiſper and ſpeake gently to them, <hi>the thunder of his power they cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</hi> For as there is a <hi>peace of God which paſſeth all underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (Phil. 4.7.) they that have it not, underſtand nothing of it, and they that have it, underſtand but little of it; <hi>it paſſeth all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi> not a naturall underſtanding onely, but alſo a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall. And as there is <hi>a love of Chriſt paſſing knowledge</hi> (Eph. 3.19.) which yet we ſhould labour to know; a love which hath an incomprehenſible height, and length, and bredth, and depth in it, which yet all the Saints are labouring to comprehend, ſo there is a manifeſtation of the will and workes of God, a Thunder of his power, which were it made and ſpoken out to us, our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding could not graſpe nor comprehend, how much ſoever we ſhould deſire and labour to comprehend it. And therefore God is pleaſed to put the <hi>treaſure</hi> of his minde and meſſages <hi>in earthen veſſells;</hi> not onely as the Apoſtle gives the reaſon (2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 4.7.) <hi>That the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us;</hi> but he doth it alſo condiſcending to our weakenes, leſt if he ſhould give out this treaſure immediately from himſelfe, or ſhould put it into ſome heavenly veſſel, we ſhould not be able to beare <hi>the excellency,</hi> or (as <hi>Job</hi> here ſpeakes) <hi>The Thunder of his power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus after a very long ventilation of the Queſtion between <hi>Job</hi> and his friends, wee are arrived at the Concluſion of their diſpute. <hi>Job</hi> hath anſwered two of his friends thrice, the third (<hi>Zophar</hi> I meane) onely twice. He it ſeemes, gave out and ſate downe,
<pb n="826" facs="tcp:153845:428"/> whether ſatisfyed or wearyed, whether having no more to ſay, or being unwilling to ſay any more, or thinking that enough had been ſayd already, I determine not. But though <hi>Jobs</hi> friends have done arguing againſt him, yet he hath not done arguing for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; Which he doth in five entire Chapters, twice called the <hi>continuation of his Parable.</hi> In what ſence he calleth his enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpeech a parable, together with the ſubject matter of it, may through the Gratious preſence, and <hi>ſupply of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, who hath helped hetherto, and hath not ſuffered that little oyle in the Cruſe to fayle,</hi> ſhine forth with a clearer light.</p>
